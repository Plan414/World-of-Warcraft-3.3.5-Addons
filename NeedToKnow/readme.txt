NeedToKnow
by Kitjan
--------------------


NeedToKnow allows you to monitor specific buffs and debuffs of your choosing as timer bars that always appear in a consistent place on your screen in a consistent color.  It's especially useful for monitoring frequently used short-duration buffs and debuffs.  For example, a rogue could configure NeedToKnow to show timer bars for Slice and Dice, Rupture, and their own stack of Deadly Poison VII.  A death knight could use it to track their own diseases on a mob.  NeedToKnow also works with procs and on-use trinkets.  The number, size, position, and appearance of timer bars are all customizable.

Instructions
------------

General options are available in the Blizzard interface options menu.  You can type "/needtoknow" or "/ntk" to lock/unlock the addon.  To configure individual bars, right click them while unlocked.  Bars work while locked.  

When entering your settings, be careful with your spelling and capitalization.  Also remember that buffs and debuffs sometimes have different names than the items and abilities that apply them.  The Death Knight ability Icy Touch, for example, applies a DoT called Frost Fever.
