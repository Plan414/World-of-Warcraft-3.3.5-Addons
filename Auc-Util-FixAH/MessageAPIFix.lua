--as of patch 3.2 message()  API has a bad frame reference. This will override with the proper frame reference
if not pcall(message) then
	print("Auctioneer is Patching bad message API introduced in patch 3.2 with a functional message API")
	function message(text)
		if ( not BasicScriptErrors:IsShown() ) then
			BasicScriptErrorsText:SetText(text)
			BasicScriptErrors:Show()
		end
	end
end
BasicScriptErrors:Hide() --pcall will likely make the frame visible if a fix has been put in place so make sure to hide the frame
