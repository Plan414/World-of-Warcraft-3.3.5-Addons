**OneRing3** is a plugin for OneBag3 that styles your keyring frame. 

It follows in the vein of minimalism and stability as the rest of the OneBag suite.  For the purpose of configuration OneRing3 will use the same settings as OneBag3.

===Features
* Doesn't display more rows than you need to see.
* Color coded slots by item rarity
* Inherits from OneBag3 any scale, background color, alpha, and other options.
          
===The Family
; OneCore
: The brains and the brawn of the outfit, Core does all the heavy lifting both logic and layout wise.  This is embedded in OneBag by default, and you shouldn't need to worry about installing it unless you're running no-lib builds.

I want to thank all the users who've been using the OneBag suite for so long.  I'm hoping not to leave the code on autopilot quite like I did once OB2 went stable, although it was nice to not have to touch it for almost two years.
