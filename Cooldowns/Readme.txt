Cooldowns by Yarko
------------------

A World of Warcraft add-on that displays numeric cooldown counters on all buttons that are 28 pixels or wider.

Configure colors, fonts, and other options through the Cooldowns interface options panel.


Using a different font in Cooldowns
-----------------------------------
1. If the font file you want to use is already located somewhere in the World of Warcraft subfolders, go to step 5. If you want to use a font file that does not already exist in the WoW file system, go to step 2.

2. Shut down WoW. When copying a new file into the WoW subfolders, WoW must be restarted or the program won't see it.

3. Copy the font file to a folder somewhere in the WoW file system. For example, you can create a new folder called Fonts in the World of Warcraft Folder and copy the file there, or you can copy the file into any of the Interface\Addons folders. Where you put it is completely up to you. Just be sure to put it someplace that makes sense and where you won't lose it. Sticking fonts into the screenshots folder doesn't make a lot of sense, for example.

4. Start WoW.

5. Go into the Cooldowns options window by going to the main menu, clicking on the Interface button, clicking on the Addons tab, and clicking on the Cooldowns menu option in the list.

6. Enter the location of the font file. This would be the path to the folder that contains the font file relative to the main WoW folder. Upper and lower case don't matter here. WoW file folder locations are always relative to the main WoW folder. For example, if you created a Fonts folder off of the main WoW folder, then enter "fonts" into the Font Location field. This is the default value since WoW uses a "hidden" folder called Fonts to store the default fonts that come with the game. The addon Recount comes with a font called ABF.ttf. Relative to the main WoW folder, that file is located in Interface\Addons\Recount\Fonts. So, to use this font in Cooldowns, you would enter "interface\addons\recount\fonts" in the location field.

7. Enter the Font File Name. Again, upper and lower case don't matter. For the Recount font file that was mentioned in the last step, you would enter "abf.ttf" as the Font File Name.

8. Set the font height. You might want to adjust this value to make some fonts more readable. Play around with it as needed.
