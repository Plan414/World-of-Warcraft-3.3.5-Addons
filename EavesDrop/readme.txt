What is it? - A simple combat log that displays events similar to how SCT/D would in a log, using icons to display spells/skills. It seperates incoming events (left side) from out going events (right side) from misc. events (middle).

What all can it show?
- Your hits, spells, misses, heals, etc...
- Incoming damage, spells, heals, buffs, debuffs, etc...
- Power gain
- Honor, Reputation, SKill, and Experience gain
- Mob/People you have slain
- Combat start/stop
- Timestamps and details in tooltips

Where did it come from? - Original idea by Bant. Coding help/samples from Andalia`s SideCombatLog and CombatChat.

How do I use it? - Unzip EavesDrop into your interface\addons directory. For more info on installing, please read install.txt. Now just run WoW and once logged in, you will see the EavesDrop in the middle of your screen. Left click the EavesDrop Tab to drag it. Right click the EavesDrop Tab to see the options menu.

FAQ
My peridoic damage is not showing up in the combat log or on the screen! How do I fix it? - You have turned off periodic damage on the Advanced Options under Interface options. Make sure the "Periodic Damage" check box is checked, even if you have Damage unchecked.

How do I reset EavesDrop or load another users settings? - EavesDrop uses the Ace3 profile system. By default all characters have their own profile. You may change this for each character using the Profile area of the option menu. You can reset the options for the current profile using the Rest option in the menu.

How do I change the fonts? - EavesDrop now supports ShareMedia, so just select your font from the options menu.
