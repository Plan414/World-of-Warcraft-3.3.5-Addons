<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>I welcome your feedback.&nbsp; The best way to contact me is through
<a target="_blank" href="http://my.curse.com/users/VgerAN/">Curse</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldofwar.net/forums/private.php?do=newpm&amp;u=262935">IncGamers</a>.&nbsp; 
You can also contact me through in-game mail: Vger on Azjol-Nerub (US), Horde.&nbsp; 
(Just make sure that, if you want a reply to an in-game mail, you keep an alt on 
my server and check mail from time to time.&nbsp; I won&#39;t have a character 
already on your server, and I don&#39;t want to have to create an alt and run to a 
mailbox just to write back.)&nbsp; Also, check out my
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgermods.com/">official site</a>, with links 
to all of my mods.</p>

	<li>HookInsecureFunction now supports hooking functions with more than 10 parameters.</li>
