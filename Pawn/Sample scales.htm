<h1>Sample scales for Pawn</h1>
<p>The power of Pawn lies in the fact that it&#39;s extremely configurable to meet 
your needs and match your preferences.&nbsp; But, it can be daunting to start 
your own scale from scratch.&nbsp; You might find the following scales useful as 
starting points, or exactly as they are.</p>
<p><b><span style="color: red;">Important:</span></b> These scales have not been 
updated for Wrath of the Lich King.&nbsp; In some cases, such as for the new 
spell power stat, Pawn will try to assign a value to spell power for you based 
on spell damage and healing.&nbsp; For other changes, such as how enhancement 
shamans now only get 1 attack power per point of strength, you will need to 
update these scale accordingly to use them in the Wrath beta.</p>
<h3 id="ScaleTags">How to use Pawn scale tags</h3>
<p>Each scale includes a Pawn scale tag that you can use to automatically add 
the scale to Pawn for your character.&nbsp; To use a scale tag:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Highlight all of the scale tag, from the &quot;(&quot; to the &quot;)&quot;, and then press
	<b>Ctrl+C</b> to copy it.</li>
	<li>In World of Warcraft, type <b>/pawn </b>in the chat window to open the 
	Pawn configuration UI.</li>
	<li>Click the <b>Import</b> button.</li>
	<li>A window will appear.&nbsp; Press <b>Ctrl+V</b> to paste the scale tag into it.</li>
	<li>Click OK.</li>
	<li>Hover over an item or click an item link to see the new scale tag in 
	action!</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finding more Pawn scales</h3>
<p>You can find more Pawn scales on the unofficial <a href="http://pawnmod.trenchrats.com/index.php" target="_blank">
Pawn Scales Resources Forum</a>.</p>
<h2>Druids: Emmerald-Draenor(EU)&#39;s feral combat models</h2>
<p>Many feral druids follow Emmerald&#39;s gear lists.&nbsp; The published stat 
values that Emmerald posts can be easily translated into Pawn scales, so you can 
calculate values automatically and in-game, without having to refer to the 
spreadsheet.&nbsp; (Emmerald takes a few additional things into account in the 
spreadsheet, and makes certain decisions regarding gems to socket that Pawn does 
not, but for the vast majority of gear, you can get very similar values 
automatically from Pawn.</p>
<h3>Cat DPS</h3>
<p>As an example, here&#39;s a scale that calculates cat DPS the same way that 
Emmerald does, accurate as of January 2008:</p>
<p class="codeblock"><b><a href="#ScaleTags">Pawn scale tag:</a></b><br />
<br />
( Pawn: v1: &quot;Emmerald cat DPS&quot;: Strength=2.0602, Agility=2.4009, Ap=1, FeralAp=1, 
ArmorPenetration=0.2371, ExpertiseRating=1.1015, HitRating=1.0876, CritRating=1.5052, 
HasteRating=1.0529, MinDamage=11.0502, RedSocket=19.2072, BlueSocket=9.6036, 
YellowSocket=14.2616, MetaSocket=54.9375 )</p>

<p>To construct this scale, I took the values for the base stats listed on the
<a href="http://www.emmerald.net/Cat_DPS/Index.html">cat DPS info page</a>, and 
put them into Pawn.&nbsp; It&#39;s important to copy over the values of sockets as 
well.&nbsp; Items with yellow and blue sockets will give slightly different 
values than what Emmerald lists, as Emmerald ignores the socket color and always 
uses red gems, discarding the socket bonus when applicable, but Pawn always 
counts socket bonuses and never mis-sockets gems.&nbsp; But, item comparisons 
will still be generally valid.</p>
<p>It&#39;s worth noting that this scale does not take into account other perfectly 
valid stats like stamina.&nbsp; It&#39;s up to you whether or not you want to add 
stamina to your version of the scale, and if you do, what value you assign it.
</p>
<h3>Bear tanking</h3>
<p>Similarly, this scale approximates Emmerald&#39;s bear tanking model:</p>
<p class="codeblock"><b><a href="#ScaleTags">Pawn scale tag:</a></b><br />
<br />
( Pawn: v1: &quot;Emmerald bear tank&quot;: Agility=3.6982, Stamina=4.1962, DefenseRating=2.4708, 
DodgeRating=2.6147, ResilienceRating=1.3027, Armor=0.4987, Health=0.2716, 
RedSocket=39.97, BlueSocket=50.3544, YellowSocket=35.0604, MetaSocket=75.5316 )</p>

<p>Similarly to how the cat DPS scale does not include stamina, this scale only 
contains mitigation stats, and not DPS stats such as attack power, which may 
still be useful to you when selecting tanking gear.</p>
<h2>Rogues: AEP (Agility Equivalence Points)</h2>
<p>One item valuation scheme used by many rogues is AEP, or Agility Equivalence 
Points.&nbsp; This scale uses Agility as the primary stat, and doesn&#39;t factor in 
too many other stats.&nbsp; For more information on AEP, see 
<a href="http://shadowpanther.net/" target="_blank">Shadow Panther&#39;s site</a>.&nbsp; 
This scale is based on the main AEP value (geared toward PvP), but you could 
also create scales for the DAEP (PvE) and MAEP (max DPS) systems too.</p>
<p>One thing to note about these scales is that weapon DPS is not factored into 
the item value.</p>
<h3>AEP (PvP)</h3>
<p class="codeblock"><b><a href="#ScaleTags">Pawn scale tag:</a></b><br />
<br />
( Pawn: v1: &quot;AEP&quot;: Armor=0.001, Strength=0.5, Agility=1, Stamina=1, HitRating=0.75, 
CritRating=0.90, Ap=0.5, ExpertiseRating=0.85, HasteRating=0.85, 
ArmorPenetration=0.15, Resilience=1, DodgeRating=0.001, BlueSocket=12, RedSocket=10, 
YellowSocket=10, MetaSocket=40 )</p>

<h2>Shamans: Malan&#39;s Elitist Jerks Enhancement Points (EP)</h2>
<p>Malan suggests in
<a href="http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t13297-enhance_shaman_collected_works_theorycraft_vol_i/" target="_blank">
Enhance Shaman: The Collected Works of Theorycraft, Col. 1</a> that&nbsp;all 
players use a simulator to get customized values for all of their stats.&nbsp; 
However, some starting values are provided for entry, middle, and high raid 
situations, provided here.&nbsp; Use these values to begin calculating 
Enhancement Points (EP) in-game, and then use a simulator to fine-tune them to 
your needs.</p>
<p>Similar to many other DPS-oriented scales, Enhancement Points does not take 
stamina into account, so you may want to value it accordingly depending on your 
needs.&nbsp; For these scales, I&#39;ve created socket values based on the 
recommended gems (Bold Living Ruby, Relentless Earthstorm Diamond, etc.).</p>
<h3>Entry raid (T4)</h3>
<p class="codeblock"><b><a href="#ScaleTags">Pawn scale tag:</a></b><br />
<br />
( Pawn: v1: &quot;Enhancement Points&quot;: Ap=1, Strength=2, Agility=1.74, CritRating=1.97,

RedSocket=16, YellowSocket=15.88, BlueSocket=8, MetaSocket=20.88, MainHandDps=9.03, 
OffHandDps=3.7, OneHandDps=3.7 )</p>

RedSocket=16, YellowSocket=16, BlueSocket=8, MetaSocket=24, MainHandDps=9.03, 
OffHandDps=3.7, OneHandDps=3.7 )</p>
<h3>High raid (T6)</h3>

<h2>Shamans: Skyhoof&#39;s Elitist Jerks &quot;how to heal like a pro&quot;</h2>
<p>In the popular shaman healing guide
<a target="_blank" href="http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t19181-shaman_how_heal_like_pro/">
How to Heal like a Pro</a>, Skyhoof outlines some different gear scales for 
resto shamans based on how far they have progressed.&nbsp; These scales are 
based on that guide, with sockets valued based on blue-quality gems for T4 and 
T5, and epic-quality gems for T6.</p>
<h3>Entry raid (T4)</h3>

<h2>Mages: include&#39;s frost and fire PvE scales</h2>
<p>User <a href="http://ui.worldofwar.net/users.php?id=219677" target="_blank">include</a> on 
worldofwar.net has assembled these scales for frost and fire mages in PvE based 
on calculations, WoWWiki research, and in-game tests.&nbsp; One 
interesting thing about these scales is that include has intentionally chosen not to 
give any value to sockets on items.</p>

<h2>Shamans: Vger&#39;s healbot scales</h2>
<p>For the curious, here are the scales that Vger uses for shamanly healbotting.&nbsp; 
I use two different main scales: one for group healing, and one for arena PvP 
(where stamina and resilience are more important, and MP5 is less important).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got a lot of random stats in my scales, which is a little strange to 
some people.&nbsp; But, I do little raiding and mostly only heal heroics, so, 
for example, resilience is worth more than nothing to me.&nbsp; Valued at 0.15 versus intellect at 1.4, I figure that getting 
many points of resilience 
is probably worth losing 1 intellect.&nbsp; Maybe it will save me from a crit 
someday when I pull healing aggro, which seems to happen a lot.&nbsp; Also, my 
current thinking is that intellect is very much undervalued as a stat, since it 
also gives you healing, spell crit, and mp5 (well, more like mp180 with mana 
tide), so my value for intellect is high compared to most ideas of what&#39;s good 
for a shaman.&nbsp; Maybe I&#39;d feel differently if I ever played with a shadow 
priest.</p>
