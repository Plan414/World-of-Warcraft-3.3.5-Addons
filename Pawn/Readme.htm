<h1>Pawn</h1>

<p>
	Pawn assesses the value of items for you to make it easy to decide which items are better than others.&nbsp; 
	It&#39;s similar in purpose to mods such as Tank Points, but completely 
	customizable, and applicable to any class and situation.
	You can use it to help create multiple gear sets, or decide whether to take 
	that weapon with higher DPS or the one with more crit rating, or decide 
	between a necklace with MP5 and one with bonus healing.
</p>
<p>
	Pawn is a mod for hardcore World of Warcraft players—you may not like it if you&#39;re not the sort of person who agonizes over 
	stats and itemization.&nbsp; You can use premade Pawn &quot;scale tags&quot; that 
	other people make and post on forums to set up Pawn for your spec without 
	any extra effort.&nbsp; And, if you&#39;re the kind of person who goes 
	through Wowhead and Lootzor looking for exactly the items you want for your gear sets, 
	builds Excel spreadsheets, installs TheoryCraft, reads Elitist Jerks... well, Pawn might just be 
	right up your alley.</p>
<p>
	I welcome your feedback—see the Notes section.</p>
<h2>
	Installing Pawn</h2>
<p>
	Pawn is installed like pretty much every other World of Warcraft mod on the 
	planet.&nbsp; Extract the contents of the zip file to your Add-ons folder, 
	generally located here:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Interface\Addons</code></p>
<h2>How Pawn works</h2>
<p>Pawn works by reading the tooltips for items in-game, and annotating them 
with some useful information, based on your personal preferences.&nbsp; Let&#39;s 
say that you&#39;re a shaman, and someone links the once-popular Molten Core tank shield Drillborer Disk in trade chat.&nbsp; With Pawn installed and set up, you might 
see the following when clicking that link:</p>
<div class="loot" style="margin-left: 1em;">
	<div class="itemname purple">Drillborer Disk</div>
	<div>Binds when picked up</div>
	<div>Off Hand&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shield</div>
	<div>2539 Armor</div>
	<div>46 Block</div>
	<div>+10 Stamina</div>
	<div class="green">Equip: When struck in combat inflicts 3 Arcane damage to the attacker.&nbsp; 
		<span class="pawnblue">(*)</span></div>
	<div class="green">Equip: Increases your block rating by 10.</div>
	<div class="green">Equip: Increases the block value of your shield by 23.</div>
	<div>&nbsp;</div>
	<div class="pawnblue">Healbot: 31</div>
	<div class="pawnblue">PvP: 292</div>
	<div class="pawnblue">* Pawn gave no value to some stats.</div>
</div>
<p>There are a couple differences between a Pawn-enhanced item tooltip and the 
normal one.&nbsp; The most obvious is the set of numbers at the bottom.&nbsp; 
I&#39;ve set up Pawn to calculate two different values for each item 
I come across: one for my &quot;healbot&quot; gear set, and one for my &quot;PvP&quot; gear set.&nbsp; 
When I&#39;m healing in raids, I don&#39;t care too much about my armor, or my block 
stats.&nbsp; So, this tank shield isn&#39;t very useful to me; it got a rating of 31 
points.&nbsp; In contrast, in PVP and solo combat, I care a lot more about armor—maybe 
someday it will help me manage to get a spell off versus a rogue before I die.&nbsp; The value of this shield 
to me in a PVP situation is considerably higher: 292 points.</p>
<p>What are these points?&nbsp; They&#39;re exactly what I like them to be.&nbsp; 
Pawn lets you set up arbitrary valuation &quot;scales&quot; for every item you come across.&nbsp; 
For each scale, you get to assign a point value to each of a wide variety of stats.&nbsp; Pawn 
will then analyze the item for you, and quickly come up with a number score 
based on the criteria that you&#39;ve set up.&nbsp; Without having to configure 
anything, Pawn will create a scale for you called &quot;Pawn value&quot; that mimics the 
way that Blizzard values the items.&nbsp; If you just want a quick overview of 
how many stats an item has, the default scale might work well for you.</p>
<p>Not every possible property of an item can be given a value.&nbsp; For 
example, the Drillborer Disk reflects 3 arcane damage to each enemy who hits the 
shield.&nbsp; This isn&#39;t a common property for items in World of Warcraft to 
have, and Pawn doesn&#39;t know how to value it.&nbsp; It tells you this by adding 
an asterisk (*) to that stat on the tooltip, and then adding a helpful message 
to the bottom.&nbsp; When making the decision of whether or not to use Drillborer Disk, you&#39;ll need to keep that in mind; if you find another PvP 
shield that also gets a rating of about 292 points, then you should choose 
Drillborer, because it has an extra stat that wasn&#39;t taken into account for the 
rating.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started.&nbsp; First, log into your character, making sure that the 
Pawn mod is enabled.&nbsp; Once you log in, start hovering over items in 
your inventory, or click links in the trade channel.&nbsp; When you hover over things like herbs and ores and quest 
items, you&#39;ll notice that the tooltip doesn&#39;t look any different than it used 
to; that&#39;s because those items don&#39;t have stats.&nbsp; When you hover over 
equipment that you&#39;re wearing, though, you should see a new line at the bottom 
that lists a &quot;Pawn value.&quot;&nbsp; Without any input from you, Pawn is assigning a score 
to every item in your inventory, using a formula somewhat similar to what Blizzard uses 
when creating the items in the first place.&nbsp; (For more information on item 
level, check out the extensive
<a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Formulas:Item_Values">WoWWiki page</a> on the 
subject, which I used when developing these default settings.)</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use Pawn right &quot;out of the box,&quot; but it&#39;s more likely that 
you&#39;ll want to customize its behavior after you try it out for a minute.&nbsp; 
So, without further ado, let&#39;s talk about customizing Pawn.</p>
<h2 id="ScaleTags">Scales</h2>
<p>Each of your characters has a unique set of options for Pawn, and can have 
any number of valuation scales, which often (but not always) represent 
different sets of gear or situations you find your character in, or different 
talent specs.&nbsp; A 
valuation scale has two things: a name, such as &quot;Pawn value&quot;, and a list of 
stats and how many points each stat is worth.</p>
<p>The first 
thing you&#39;ll need to do is decide what you&#39;ll do with Pawn.&nbsp; The important 
thing to remember is that Pawn doesn&#39;t decide which stats are best for your 
character!&nbsp; You need to make this decision for yourself, and tailor it to 
the way that you play.&nbsp; Once you &quot;tell&quot; Pawn which stats you like, it does 
all of the math to tell you which items are better than others, exactly 
according to what you think of each stat.&nbsp; Here are some suggestions to get 
you started:</p>
<ul>
	<li>One possibility is just having Pawn calculate the total attack power 
	that an item will give you.&nbsp; A feral druid in cat form gets two points 
	of attack power per point of strength, one point of attack power per point 
	of agility, one point of attack power per point of attack power on the item 
	(of course), and no benefit from ranged attack power.&nbsp; This druid could 
	set up a scale called &quot;attack power&quot; that adds those numbers up 
	automatically: Strength = 2, Agility = 1, Attack power = 1, Feral AP = 1, and Ranged 
	AP = 0.</li>
	<li>Healers need to balance a variety of different stats to maximize their 
	healing output: intellect, spirit, +healing, and mana per five.&nbsp; 
	They don&#39;t care about strength and agility.&nbsp; So, a &quot;healbot&quot; valuation 
	scale could be Strength = 0, Agility = 0, Stamina = 0.5, Intellect = 1, 
	Spirit = 1, Healing = 0.5, Spell damage = 0, and Mana per 5 = 3.5.</li>
	<li>Hybrid classes often need totally different gear for their different 
	specs.&nbsp; A resto shaman needs healing gear, but an enhancement shaman 
	needs melee DPS gear.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a resto shaman, but when possible you 
	try to collect some enhancement gear so you can respec in the future, you 
	might have two scales: one for healing gear, and one for enhancement gear.&nbsp; 
	Even when you&#39;re healing the instance, you can see if those bracers that 
	nobody wants are worth picking up for your enhancement set.&nbsp; Pawn will 
	show you both numbers on each item you come across.</li>
	<li>Many people have a set of resistance gear, but deciding between an 
	item that has 15 resistance and another that has 10 resistance but 
	also a bunch of nice stats can be hard.&nbsp; You can set up a scale that helps 
	you decide whether those extra few points of resistance are worth 
	sacrificing all of those stats.</li>
	<li>Similar mods to Pawn exist for more specialized roles.&nbsp; For 
	example, Tank Points is a popular mod for warriors that helps balance 
	different types of gear.&nbsp; TP has different functionality from what Pawn 
	provides, but you can make similar sorts of decisions about tanking gear in 
	Pawn using the same system that you&#39;d use for all of your other characters.&nbsp; 
	Remember, Pawn does a lot of math for you, but it won&#39;t tell you which stats 
	are more desirable than others; that&#39;s for you to decide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, maybe, someone has already shared a Pawn scale tag with you, so that you 
can use a scale that they created or found themselves.</p>
<h2>Pawn Scale Tags</h2>
<p>Scale tags are a handy way that you can share your Pawn scales with other 
people, similar to how you can share talent specs with others just by giving 
them a link to the WoW talent calculator.&nbsp; A sample scale tag looks like 
this:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	( Pawn: v1: &quot;Total fire damage&quot;: SpellDamage=1, FireSpellDamage=1 )</p>
	<p>Generally, they&#39;re considerably longer than that, but the overall format 
	is still the same.&nbsp; A scale tag includes the parentheses ( ) on the 
	ends and everything in-between.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible to use Pawn along with scale tags that other people have 
created and never have to do any custom calculations or work yourself.&nbsp; 
Here&#39;s how you can use scale tags to share Pawn scales.</p>
<h3>Adding a Pawn scale that someone shared with you</h3>
<p>You can easily add Pawn scales that someone else shared with you as a scale 
tag to your own copy of Pawn.&nbsp; To access the Pawn configuration UI, open 
your character sheet and inventory (the <b>C</b> key) and click the Pawn button 
in the lower-right corner.&nbsp; Or, type the following slash command:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/pawn</code></p>
<p>From this screen, click <b>Import</b>.&nbsp; A window will appear where you can paste the entire scale tag that you got 
from someone else.&nbsp; Press Ctrl+V to paste a scale tag from the clipboard 
into this window.&nbsp; Once you&#39;re done, click OK, and that scale will be added 
to your copy of Pawn.</p>
<ul>
	<li>You can&#39;t import a scale tag if the scale has the exact same name as a 
	scale you already have.&nbsp; For example, if you have a scale named &quot;Pawn 
	value&quot;, you can&#39;t import a new scale tag named &quot;Pawn value&quot;.</li>
	<li>To copy a scale tag from your web browser, highlight the entire scale 
	tag with your mouse, and then press Ctrl+C to copy it.&nbsp; Make sure that 
	you get the whole thing, including the &quot;(&quot; at the beginning and the &quot;)&quot; at 
	the end.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sharing a Pawn scale with others</h3>
<p>You can share one of your Pawn scales with 
others by exporting it from the configuration UI.&nbsp; Click the Pawn button on 
your character inventory window, or type the following slash command:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/pawn</code></p>
<p>From here, choose the scale that you want to export (if you have more than 
one) from the <b>Current scale</b> list, and then click <b>Export</b>.&nbsp; A window will appear containing your entire scale tag, but most of it will be 
scrolled off to the left where you can&#39;t see it.&nbsp; Press <b>Ctrl+C</b> to copy the 
scale tag to your clipboard.&nbsp; Then, switch to your web browser or an 
instant message window, or wherever you&#39;d like to share your Pawn scale, and 
press <b>Ctrl+V</b> to paste the tag to that window.</p>
<h3>Finding more Pawn scales</h3>
<p>You can find more Pawn scales on the unofficial <a href="http://pawnmod.trenchrats.com/index.php" target="_blank">
Pawn Scales Resources Forum</a>.&nbsp; Or, try the Pawn page at
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/">Curse</a> or
<a target="_blank" href="http://wowui.incgamers.com/?p=mod&amp;m=3999">
WoWUI.IncGamers</a>.</p>
<h2>Setting up a custom Pawn scale for one of your characters</h2>
<p>You can customize your Pawn scale in the Pawn configuration UI.&nbsp; To show 
it, click the Pawn button in the lower-right corner of the character inventory 
window (the <b>C</b> key), or type the following slash command:</p>
<p class="codeblock">
	<code>/pawn</code></p>
<p>Nobody thinks all 
statistics are created equal.&nbsp; Warrior tanks don&#39;t care about intellect and 
spirit.&nbsp; Priests don&#39;t care about strength.&nbsp; You can customize Pawn to 
only look at the stats that you care about.&nbsp; Let&#39;s do it now.</p>
<p>The Pawn configuration UI has everything you need to make changes to your 
scale, as well as import scales from other people, export them so you can share 
yours with others, and create multiple new scales for different situations.&nbsp; 
Right now, the &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale is selected and ready to be modified.</p>
<p>On the left, you see a long list of all of the different item stats that Pawn 
understands.&nbsp; They&#39;re grouped into categories—the primary stats like 
Stamina and Intellect are at the top, weapon stats are another section, 
spell-related state are another, sockets for gems are another, and so on.&nbsp; 
The default Pawn value scale that was created for you has a value for almost 
every stat.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s make some changes.&nbsp; Let&#39;s delete the stats that we don&#39;t care 
about.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a melee class, you can get rid of intellect and spirit.&nbsp; 
To do this, click on Intellect in the list on the left (it&#39;s near the top).&nbsp; 
When you click on a stat, you see a little description about the stat to the 
right (there&#39;s not much to say about intellect), and a box where you can type a 
new value.&nbsp; To get rid of intellect, either delete the number from the box, 
or replace it with 0.&nbsp; Then, choose spirit from the list and delete it too.&nbsp; 
You can delete any stats you don&#39;t care about, and you can change the value of 
any stat in the list.&nbsp; (If you find yourself removing a lot of stats, you 
can also create a new empty scale and start from scratch.&nbsp; That would 
probably be easier than deleting everything individually.&nbsp; The downside is 
that you don&#39;t get to see the starting values we suggested for each stat.)</p>
<p>Cool.&nbsp; You don&#39;t have to do anything complicated just yet; that should 
be fine.&nbsp; Your changes will take effect immediately; you can hover over new 
items or click links in trade chat and you&#39;ll see updated values based on your 
newly-modified scale.&nbsp; Once you have thing set up the way you like them, 
Pawn will be customized to exactly what you care about in items.</p>
<p>If you ever manage to really screw things up, you can click Delete to delete 
the scale you&#39;re working on, and then click New default to create a new scale 
from the defaults.&nbsp; If you name it &quot;Pawn value&quot; you&#39;ll be right back where 
you started.</p>
<h3>Setting up a second Pawn scale</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t have to have one scale called &quot;Pawn value&quot;; you can set up as many 
as you like.&nbsp; To do this, go into the Pawn configuration UI and click <b>
New empty</b> to start a new scale with no values for any stat, or <b>New 
default</b> to start a new scale using the defaults as a starting point.&nbsp; 
When you have two different scales, Pawn will show two numbers on each item you 
hover over or click in chat.&nbsp; You can have any number of scales; just 
choose the one that you want to work on in the configuration UI before you start 
making changes to the stats.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Well, hopefully that&#39;s enough to get you started.&nbsp; If you&#39;re interested 
in customizing Pawn further, check out the <b>Options</b> tab of the Pawn UI, 
and rest of this document.</p>
<h3>Contacting the author</h3>
<p>I&#39;m interested in knowing what you think of Pawn, and what you use 
it for.&nbsp; Bug reports and suggestions are cool too.&nbsp; The best way to contact me is on the
<a href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/" target="_blank">Pawn page at Curse</a> or 
the
<a href="http://wowui.incgamers.com/ui.php?id=3999" target="_blank">Pawn page at IncGamers</a>.&nbsp; 
I check both roughly daily.&nbsp; You can also contact me through in-game mail: Vger on Azjol-Nerub (US), Horde.&nbsp; 
(Just make sure that you keep a character on 
my server and check your mail, or I can&#39;t respond!)&nbsp; Also, check out my
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.vgermods.com/">official site</a>, where you 
can find links to all of my mods.</p>
<h3>Reporting bugs</h3>
<p>When reporting bugs, it&#39;s helpful to be as specific as possible.&nbsp; Does 
the problem always happen for you, or just sometimes?&nbsp; Can you think of any 
mods that you&#39;re running that might be related?&nbsp; Does the problem still 
occur if you disable all your mods except Pawn and VgerCore?&nbsp; What item 
does it happen on?</p>
<p>WoW now hides interface error information from you by default.&nbsp; Reenabling it 
in Interface Options would 
be helpful; the error text includes useful information about where the error 
occurred.&nbsp; Installing a mod like <a href="http://auctioneeraddon.com/dl/" target="_blank">Swatter</a>
can provide even more useful error information that can help Vger track down the bug.</p>
<h3>Key bindings</h3>
<p>In addition to the options in the Pawn UI, you can also set a key binding to 
open and close the Pawn UI.&nbsp; Look for it in the list of key bindings under 
&quot;Pawn.&quot;</p>
<h2>Item valuation notes</h2>
<p>Here are some notes that may help you while you&#39;re setting up your Pawn 
scales.</p>
<h3>Socket bonuses</h3>
<p>Socket bonuses are factored into the value of an item, even if the sockets 
are empty.&nbsp; Since gems can be readily purchased for very low cost, it&#39;s 
assumed that the player can easily socket the proper gems in order to get the 
bonus, <i>or</i> get better statistics from socketing different gems.&nbsp; For 
example, let&#39;s say you have an item with a red socket.&nbsp; Your scale says 
that a red socket is worth 4, and strength is worth 1.&nbsp; If you socket a gem 
that gives you +4 strength in that socket, the value of the item will stay the 
same: it lost a red socket worth 4 points, and gained 4 strength each worth 1 
point.&nbsp; If you socket a gem worth anything other than 4 points, the item 
value <i>will </i>change.</p>
<p>In the default Pawn scale, sockets are worth four 
	base stats, since you can easily purchase vendor gems that give you four of 
	a base stat upon first receiving a socketed item.&nbsp; You may wish to 
	value sockets more highly, since jewelcrafters can produce nicer gems for a 
nominal fee.&nbsp; The following table summarizes how many base stats each 
&quot;tier&quot; of gems has:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><i>Gems at level 70</i></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Gem quality</b></td>
		<td><b>Number of base stats</b></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>White (vendor)</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>

	</tr>
</table>
<br />
<table>
	<tr>
		<td colspan="2"><i>Gems at level </i>80</td>

		<td>20</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Epic (BoP JC-only crafted)</td>
		<td>27</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
<p>Pawn is smart enough to notice cases when the socket bonus isn&#39;t worth 
socketing inferior gems, too.&nbsp; For example, let&#39;s say you have a PVP scale 
where you value stamina and resilience rating at 1 point each.&nbsp; You might 
value a blue socket at 12 points (for Solid Star of Elune) and a yellow socket 
at 8 points (Mystic Dawnstone).&nbsp; Now, imagine one of the S3 Vindicator&#39;s 
Pendant items, which have a yellow socket and +3 Stamina socket bonus. Previous 
versions of Pawn would value that socket and bonus at 11 points: 8 for the 
socket, and 3 for the bonus. Now Pawn is smart enough to notice that it would be better to ignore 
the socket bonus and just socket a blue gem, so it values it at 12 points.&nbsp; 
If you turn on the <b>Show debug info</b> option, Pawn will make a note of this 
in your chat log.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t like this new behavior, you can force Pawn to use the old 
behavior and always use the correct color of gem instead of trying to maximize 
the value of an item.&nbsp; This setting can be set individually for each scale.&nbsp; 
To change it, select the scale you want to modify, and then select one of the 
three colored gems from the list of stats, and then choose the appropriate 
option in the list that appears.</p>
<h3>Healing and spell damage</h3>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>The individual healing and spell damage stats are no 
longer applicable in Wrath of the Lich King and WoW 3.0.&nbsp; They have been 
replaced with a single common stat, &quot;spell power.&quot;</p>
<p>The way that healing and spell damage work has changed since previous 
versions of Pawn.&nbsp; Now, those stats more closely reflect the numbers shown 
on item tooltips.&nbsp; An item that says that it does 75 damage and healing 
(such as a staff for a mage) will have 75 of the spell damage stat and 75 of the 
healing stat.&nbsp; An item that says that it does 300 healing and 100 damage 
(such as a nice healing weapon) will have 300 of the healing stat and 100 of the 
spell damage stat.&nbsp; An enchantment that gives 50 bonus fire and shadow 
damage will have 50 of the fire spell damage stat, 50 of the shadow spell damage 
stat, and none of the typical spell damage stat.</p>
<h3>Resistances</h3>
<p>For resistances, there&#39;s an &quot;all resistances&quot; stat and individual resistances.&nbsp; The +3 All Resistances cloak 
	enchantment would add three points of &quot;all resistances&quot; to the cloak, but no points 
	of &quot;fire resistance.&quot;&nbsp; If you&#39;re putting together a scale for fire resistance, 
	give points to both &quot;all resistances&quot; and &quot;fire resistances.&quot;</p>
<h3>Weapon speed</h3>
<p>Weapon speed can work a little differently than the other stats.&nbsp; Some 
people value weapon speed based on how much faster or slower a weapon is than a 
particular speed.&nbsp; The &quot;speed baseline&quot; stat (which isn&#39;t really a stat, 
per se) lets you choose this baseline speed, instead of 0, which is the speed 
baseline if you don&#39;t pick a different one.&nbsp; For example, to give an item 1 
point for every tenth of a second slower than 2.9 seconds per swing (useful for, 
say, enhancement shamans), set speed to 10 (10 = 1 / 0.1) and speed baseline to 
2.9.&nbsp; If you value faster weapons, pick your preferred speed baseline and then set 
the value speed to be negative, because higher numbers for speed are bad for 
you.</p>
<p>Speed baseline shows up in the &quot;special weapon stats&quot; category.</p>
<h3>Special weapon stats</h3>
<p>If you want to value different types of weapons differently, don&#39;t use the 
regular DPS, minimum damage, maximum damage, and speed stats; instead, use the 
ones in the &quot;special weapon stats&quot; category at the end of the list.&nbsp; For 
example, if you&#39;re a hunter, you might value ranged DPS much higher than melee 
DPS, since most of your damage comes from ranged attacks.</p>
You won&#39;t want to use all of the weapon min damage, max damage, and DPS 
	stats all at once.<ul>
		<li>Do you care about top-end damage only?&nbsp; Use the max damage 
		stats.&nbsp; (max damage, 1H: max damge, Ranged: max damage, ...)</li>
		<li>Do you care about damage per second only?&nbsp; Use the DPS stats.&nbsp; 
		(DPS, 1H: DPS, Ranged: DPS, ...)</li>
		<li>Do you care about only melee weapons in general, but not which 
		hand?&nbsp; Use the Melee stats.&nbsp; (Melee: min damage, Melee: DPS, ...)</li>
		<li>Do you care about the top end damage of all melee weapons that fit 
		in your main hand?&nbsp; Use MH: max damage <i>and</i> 1H: max damage.</li>
		<li>If you use the specialized versions of stats, don&#39;t also use the 
		general ones.&nbsp; For example, if you use Melee: DPS, don&#39;t also use 
		DPS.&nbsp; 
		If you use Melee: min damage and/or Melee: max damage, you probably don&#39;t want 
		to also use Melee: DPS.</li>
		<li>The OH: DPS stat and other off hand-related stats do not take 
		into account the decreased damage and hit rate of off-hand weapons.&nbsp; 
		The information is, as always, pulled straight from the tooltip.</li>
		<li>If you care about average damage versus minimum and maximum damage, 
		take the value you would have assigned to average damage if it existed 
		as a stat, and add half to minimum damage and half to maximum damage.&nbsp; 
		For example, if you wanted to set Ranged: average damage to 10, but then found 
		out that Ranged: average damage doesn&#39;t exist, set Ranged: min 
		damage to 5 and Ranged: max damage to 5 instead.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Normalizing values (like Lootzor)</h3>
<p>With the &quot;Normalize values&quot; option disabled (the default), Pawn calculates values by multiplying each stat on 
an item by the value of that stat in each of your scales.&nbsp; If you enable 
this option, Pawn will take that number and divide it by the sum of <i>all</i> 
of the stat values in each of your scales.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to generate 
the same sorts of numbers that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lootzor.com/">
Lootzor</a> does.</p>
<p>For example, if your scale were ( Stamina = 1, Intellect = 2, 
		Healing = .5 ), then Lootzor would divide the item&#39;s value by 3.5.&nbsp; 
		An item with 10 Stamina, 10 Intellect, and 20 Healing would have a value 
		of 40 with this option off, and 11.43 with this option on.</p>
<p>This option is not particularly useful for the default Pawn scale, 
		as it includes too many stats.&nbsp; It&#39;s more useful if you use more 
		focused scales, especially if you want to be able to compare values from 
		two different scales.&nbsp; The numbers will not be exactly the same as you see on Lootzor in 
		all cases, because Lootzor and Pawn still work a little differently.&nbsp; 
		For example, Lootzor picks gems to socket for you, whereas Pawn lets you 
		pick an explicit value for sockets.</p>
<h3>Unrecognized stats (*)</h3>
<p>It&#39;s normal for certain rare item characteristics to be listed with an asterisk (*).&nbsp; 
You need to decide how important that bonus is to you yourself.&nbsp; For 
example, Pawn doesn&#39;t have a value for &quot;Equip: Increases the effect that healing 
and mana potions have on the wearer by 40%&quot; because only one item is like that, 
and the value in Pawn comes from the fact that even though each item is 
different, the stats on items are mostly the same.&nbsp; But, if 
you come across an item that has a <i>standard </i>statistic, such as intellect, 
crit rating, or spell power, or fire resistance, and Pawn marks it with an 
asterisk, you might want to let Vger know—take a 
note of which item has the problem, and which statistic on the item that Pawn 
didn&#39;t understand.&nbsp; You can use the <b>Show debug info</b> calculation 
option (see &quot;The Options tab&quot; below) to learn more about how Pawn is calculating the stats for your item.&nbsp; Also, be sure to check the &quot;known issues&quot; section 
at the bottom of this document; I might already know about the problem.</p>
<h4>Set bonuses</h4>
<p>Set bonuses are an exception: set bonuses are never counted for any stats, 
whether you qualify for them or not.&nbsp; However, they don&#39;t get asterisks, 
mainly just because all set items would have a bunch of them and it would just 
be a lot of &quot;noise.&quot;</p>
	<h2>Mod support</h2>
<p>Have a favorite mod that doesn&#39;t seem to work with Pawn?&nbsp; Let me know.&nbsp; 
I may not be able to add support for your favorite, but I might be able to 
suggest a replacement, or update Pawn to work better in a future version for 
popular mods.</p>
<h3>Mods that have been tested and work with Pawn</h3>
<p>This is not a conclusive list.&nbsp; Also, many of these mods will require 
updates for WoW patch 3.0, which may affect how they operate with Pawn.</p>

<h2>Wrath of the Lich King</h2>
<p>This version of Pawn should work on both the live realms and on the Wrath of 
the Lich King beta.&nbsp; If you run into problems on the Wrath beta, please let 
me know, and I&#39;ll try to correct them in a future version.&nbsp; There are a couple differences in the way that Pawn works 
in Wrath of the Lich King that you should be aware of.</p>
<h3>How Wrath affects your scales</h3>
<p>Since stats work differently in live WoW versus Wrath, you may need to 
maintain two slightly different versions of your scales if you&#39;re affected by 
these itemization changes.&nbsp; When patch 3.0 goes live, the corresponding 
version of Pawn will automatically update your scales as best it can, so you 
shouldn&#39;t need to worry about these things too much if you&#39;re not in the beta.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Spell power—In Wrath of the Lich King, caster items simply have spell 
	power (spell damage and healing), and items that give only healing have been 
	converted to give both.&nbsp; The conversion is roughly as follows: spell power = 
	.7 * damage + .3 * healing, rounded down.</li>
	<li>Hit, crit, and haste—In Wrath of the Lich King, caster items that gave 
	spell hit rating, spell crit rating, and/or spell haste rating have been 
	converted to give a generic hit/crit/haste rating stat that works for 
	spells, melee, and ranged attacks. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Release history</h2>
<h3>Version 1.1.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for account-bound (gold-quality) items and more new things that appear in 
	WoW 3.0.</li>
	<li>Fixed an error message that could appear when using some item links from 
	sites like Wowhead.</li>
	<li>Armor penetration works once more on WoW 3.0.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed Link Wrangler compatibility, which was broken in Pawn 1.1.</li>
	<li>Items that have at least one recognized stat (normally marked with an 
	asterisk) will be marked as such in the Compare tab.&nbsp; (This feature 
	existed in 1.1 betas but did not appear in the final version.)</li>
	<li>Added support for Lake Wintergrasp items and the Scourgestone.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>This version of Pawn has been tested on both the live realms and on the Wrath of 
the Lich King beta, and includes <i>tons</i> of fixes to make Pawn work 
	correctly on Wrath servers, and to support new stats and types of items that 
	appear in the expansion content, including new stats, new gems, encrypted 
	items, colorless sockets, and more.</li>
	<li>Pawn now sports a new tab, Compare, which lets you see two items 
	side-by-side to compare their stats in more detail.&nbsp; Check it out!<ul>
		<li>You can compare any two items in your inventory or a merchant&#39;s 
		inventory by dropping them in 
		the slots.</li>
		<li>If the left slot is empty and you drop an item in the right slot, 
		your currently equipped item will automatically be put in the left slot.</li>
		<li>In addition to dragging and dropping items, all of the following 
		shortcuts also work:<ul>
			<li>Clicking either of the &quot;currently equipped&quot; shortcut buttons 
			that appear in the lower-left corner once there is an item in the 
			right slot.</li>
			<li>Hovering over an item in your inventory, another player&#39;s 
			inventory, a vendor&#39;s inventory, an item link window, AtlasLoot, or 
			other locations, and pressing the &quot;[&quot; or 
			&quot;]&quot; key.&nbsp; (This key binding is customizable in the regular key 
			bindings interface.)</li>
			<li>You can also right-click item link windows and item icons in 
			loot roll windows to immediately compare the item with your 
			currently equipped item.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The first time you run Pawn after upgrading to 1.1, Pawn will 
	automatically bind keys to its commands if you aren&#39;t using those keys for 
	other things.&nbsp; By default, &quot;P&quot; will open and close the Pawn UI, and &quot;[&quot; 
	and &quot;]&quot; are used for item comparisons.&nbsp; If 
	you later unbind those keys or bind them to other actions, Pawn won&#39;t try to 
	rebind them.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where Pawn values didn&#39;t show up on item link windows if you 
	only had unenchanted numbers visible, not enchanted numbers.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where error text would appear in the chat window when 
	hovering over recipes in Ackis Recipe List and possibly other similar mods.</li>
	<li>German users rejoice!&nbsp; When entering stat values you can now use a 
	comma instead of a period as a decimal separator—for example, &quot;0,5&quot; now 
	works in addition to &quot;0.5&quot;.</li>
	<li>In this version of Pawn, I&#39;ve significantly reorganized a lot of the code that reads 
	and annotates item tooltips.&nbsp; This, coupled with other changes in Wrath 
	of the Lich King, is likely to cause some conflicts with other mods.&nbsp; 
	If you run into problems with Pawn, please remember to try to reproduce the 
	same problem with no other item-related mods installed.&nbsp; I still may be 
	able to fix the bug if it turns out that the bug is related to another mod, 
	but I need to know <i>which</i> mod to download and try.</li>
	</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a bug that would prevent Pawn from working properly if one or
	more of your scales didn't assign a value to the spell damage stat.</li>
	<li>Updated the value of the armor penetration and spell penetration stats 
	in the default Pawn scale to match current itemization.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales are not changed.</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer try to assign a default value to spell damage (WoW 2.4) if you use
	a scale that contains only spell power (WoW 3.0).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added an entry in the Interface Options dialog to launch the Pawn UI, in 
	case you hide the Pawn button and forget how to get it back.</li>
	<li>You can now assign a value to the Wrath of the Lich King &quot;spell power&quot; 
	stat to your scales.&nbsp; It uses the same values by default as the &quot;spell 
	power&quot; stat in Pawn 0.7.4, and your existing scales will be assigned a value 
	for the stat automatically.&nbsp; Your scales will still have spell damage 
	and healing stats in them, but they won&#39;t be used for anything.</li>
	<li>In Wrath of the Lich King, the stats that currently appear as melee hit 
	rating, melee crit rating, and melee haste will also apply to spells, and 
	the spell hit, crit, and haste rating stats are not used.&nbsp; Existing 
	scales will not be modified at this time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When Armory is installed, added support for showing unenchanted values 
	on the item comparison tooltips that appear when holding down the Alt key.</li>
	<li>Added support for the stat-only components of Surefooted, Cat&#39;s 
	Swiftness, and Boar&#39;s Speed.&nbsp; (The run speed and snare resistance 
	effects are ignored since there are no Pawn stats for those.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked a link for an item that had an icon and 
	then a link for a spell that did not have an icon, the item&#39;s icon would not 
	properly disappear.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug with reading certain items with multiple stats on the same 
	line that was causing problems with the French translation in progress.</li>
	<li>Removed a bunch more asterisks from various items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s now possible to force Pawn to always calculate an item&#39;s value 
	based on the correct color of gems (Pawn 0.8 and older behavior) instead of 
	maximizing the item&#39;s value by potentially using the wrong colors and 
	ignoring the socket bonus (Pawn 0.9 and later behavior).&nbsp; To change the 
	option for one of your scales, choose that scale in the UI and then choose 
	one of the colored sockets from the stat list.</li>
	<li>Added support for socket bonuses (and possible future gems) that give 
	melee haste rating.</li>
	<li>Added shaman healing scales based on the popular Elitist Jerks thread to 
	the sample scales document that comes with Pawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 1.0</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Restored compatibility with Link Wrangler, which stopped working in Pawn 0.9.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing Pawn values on Link Wrangler&#39;s &quot;compare 
	equipped items&quot; tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added support for showing inventory icons next to Link Wrangler 
	tooltips.</li>
	<li>There&#39;s now a &quot;getting started&quot; tab to gently remind new users to read 
	the Readme file.</li>
	<li>Takes advantage of new WoW 2.4 functionality to show inventory icons 
	next to item link windows in a few situations where it couldn&#39;t before.</li>
	<li>Various other UI and text tweaks.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.9</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn is now smarter about the way that it values sockets and socket 
	bonuses, which in some cases will slightly change the values of certain 
	items, both with and without gems.<ul>
		<li>If you&#39;ve already filled all of the sockets on an item and you don&#39;t 
		qualify for the socket bonus, Pawn no longer counts the socket bonus 
		stats, since they&#39;re not actually there.</li>
		<li>If you can get a better value by socketing the wrong colors of gems 
		and ignoring the socket bonus, Pawn will now do that when calculating 
		item values.&nbsp; (When the &quot;Show debug info&quot; option is enabled, Pawn 
		will tell you which color gems it used.)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Pawn now remembers all of the stats from several of the last items 
	you&#39;ve viewed so it doesn&#39;t have to always recalculate them.&nbsp; This 
	should help your framerate when rapidly hovering over many items in 
	succession, especially when an equip compare mod is also installed.</li>
	<li>You now have to type the word &quot;delete&quot; to confirm that you really want 
	to delete a scale.</li>
	<li>You can now make a copy of an existing scale by clicking the new Copy 
	button.</li>
	<li>There is now an option to hide a specific scale from tooltips without 
	having to delete it (and, most likely, export it and paste it somewhere for 
	safekeeping).</li>
	<li>Pawn will no longer look for stats on quest, spell, and ability links in 
	WoW 2.4.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bunch of UI bugs that occurred when deleting your last scale.</li>
	<li>Pawn no longer adds unnecessary asterisks to Black Temple instance-bound items, such as Naj&#39;entus Spine.</li>
	<li>Added support for Reckless Noble Topaz and other gems with spell haste 
	rating.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now displays the current Pawn version number on the last 
	tab.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports addons that modify the Inspect window when it is first 
	shown instead of immediately upon login, such as Spyglass.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>You can now hover over the Pawn button on the inventory window to get a 
	grand total of the enchanted values on all of your equipped items.</li>
	<li>There is now a disabled Pawn button on the inspect window that you can 
	hover over to get totals for all of another player&#39;s equipped items.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where all on/off options that defaulted to being on (show 
	enchanted values, show unenchanted values, and show tooltip icons) would 
	automatically turn back on after logging out and back in.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes disabling enchanted values would cause 
	unenchanted values to also not be displayed.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the word &quot;Projectile&quot; on stacks of arrows would get an 
	asterisk, and their DPS would not count as ranged DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where negative values would not be exported in scale tags.&nbsp; 
	(Negative stat values are most common with weapon speed.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.8</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Pawn UI now has an Options tab that you can use to set all Pawn 
	options.</li>
	<li>Almost all of the Pawn slash commands are now unnecessary, and have been 
	removed.&nbsp; You can still use /pawn to open the Pawn UI, and /pawn debug 
	is still available as well.</li>
	<li>Tooltips have been added to pretty much everything in the Pawn UI.</li>
	<li>You can use the new calculation option &quot;Normalize values&quot; to divide all of your scale values by 
	the sum of all of the numbers in the scale.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to 
	generate the same sorts of numbers that Lootzor does.&nbsp; (See the 
	appropriate section in the readme file for more details.)</li>
	<li>You can now change the text color for your scales individually from the 
	Pawn UI.&nbsp; You could, for example, make your healing scale show up in 
	white and your DPS scale show up in red.</li>
	<li>You can now bind a key to the Pawn UI.&nbsp; Look under &quot;Pawn&quot; in the 
	standard key bindings list.</li>
	<li>Added support for the Fiery Weapon enchantment; Pawn counts it as 4 dps.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where sometimes tooltip icons would not appear for items 
	that had never been in your inventory.&nbsp; (This includes most links in 
	trade chat.)</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you clicked on an item link for an item, and then a 
	tradeskill recipe (such as [Alchemy: Super Mana Potion]), the icon for the 
	previous item would stay since the recipe did not have one.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where if you had set custom colors for your scales, scales 
	would no longer always be sorted alphabetically by name on item tooltips.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now shows inventory icons next to item link and item comparison 
	tooltips, so when someone links an item, you can also see its inventory 
	icon.&nbsp; You can turn this feature off with /pawn icons off.<ul>
		<li>This feature works with the built-in WoW functionality, as well as a 
		variety of other tooltip mods: EquipCompare, EQCompare, and MultiTips.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When /pawn ids on is active, Pawn now displays the item IDs of all 
	applicable enchantments and gems in the tooltip as well.&nbsp; For example, 
	if looking at item 123 with no enchantment and gems 45 and 67 socketed, you 
	would see &quot;Item ID: 123:0:45:67&quot;.</li>
	<li>You can now have Pawn align item values (and IDs and levels, if those 
	options are on) along the right side of the tooltip with /pawn align numbers 
	right.&nbsp; Some people may find this easier to read; others may find it 
	more difficult.</li>
	<li>A new category of stats has been added, &quot;weapon types,&quot; which is 
	primarily useful for racial abilities and talents.<ul>
		<li>For example, orcs 
	get a passive 5 expertise bonus when using axes.&nbsp; So, you might give a 
		weapon a few bonus points just for being an axe.&nbsp; At level 70, 5 
		expertise costs 78.8 expertise rating, so you might value &quot;being an axe&quot; 
		as high as 78.8.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn plugins for FuBar and Titan Panel are now available as 
	separate downloads.&nbsp; You can get them at
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/">Curse</a>.</li>
	<li>The old &quot;spell power&quot; stat made sense before patch 2.3, but it was 
	particularly confusing to healers after that patch, so I&#39;ve removed it, and 
	replaced it with easier-to-understand &quot;spell damage&quot;.&nbsp; Now, 
	the healing stat only 
	includes healing, and the spell damage stat only includes spell damage.<ul>
		<li>Now, Light&#39;s Justice, which says that it increases healing by 382 
		and damage by 128, has 382 healing and 128 spell damage, exactly as 
		you&#39;d expect.</li>
		<li>Pawn will automatically upgrade your existing scales and any scale 
		tags that you import.&nbsp; Please double-check the value of the spell 
		damage stat after importing to make sure that it&#39;s what you intended, 
		as in this version Pawn does not read your mind.&nbsp; 
		The upgrade process will give correct results for typical cases (DPS 
		casters who don&#39;t care about healing; healers who valued spell power at 
		least as high as healing, as they should have), but may not give the 
		results you expect if you had a strange scale (healing but no spell 
		power).</li>
		<li>As always, the default Pawn scale has been adjusted to accommodate 
		these changes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn enchanted has been added to let you turn off 
	the enchanted item values, showing only the unenchanted, unsocketed values 
	for items.&nbsp; (You can also use /pawn enchanted off along with /pawn 
	unenchanted off to temporarily hide all Pawn values.)&nbsp; This option may 
	not be compatible with all of your favorite tooltip mods, but it should work 
	in all cases where you currently get unenchanted item values today, which is 
	most everywhere.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button has a new, unique look, instead of being a regular red 
	WoW button.</li>
	<li>The Pawn button now appears in a more reasonable spot when the character 
	inventory window has been skinned using a mod such as Skinner.</li>
	<li>A new slash command /pawn button has been added to let you move the Pawn 
	button on the inventory window, or hide it completely.&nbsp; (If you hide 
	the button, you&#39;ll need to type /pawn to open the Pawn UI, or use the 
	Pawn plugin for FuBar or Titan Panel.)</li>
	<li>Added a new option to the /pawn asterisks slash command, /pawn asterisks 
	no text.&nbsp; Using this option is the same as /pawn asterisks auto, except 
	the &quot;* Pawn gave no value to some stats&quot; warning text is not added to 
	tooltips of items with at least one (*) unrecognized stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added a button to the inventory window to show and hide the Pawn 
	configuration UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now supports Armory and EquipCompare working together with the &quot;/eqc 
	alt&quot; option to show comparisons with your alt&#39;s gear instead of your current 
	character&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Added support for the unusual items with negative stats, such as Kreeg&#39;s 
	Mug, which gives -10 Intellect.</li>
	<li>Added support for Braided Eternium Chain and other non-weapon items with 
	weapon damage as an equip bonus.&nbsp; It shows up as minimum damage and 
	maximum damage, but not DPS—it&#39;s not a weapon, so there&#39;s no speed, and 
	therefore no DPS.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that would frequently show up when using Pawn with 
	CowTip, causing an error message to appear in chat when hovering over an 
	item and then an empty inventory slot.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where sometimes an open item link window would not be 
	immediately updated upon making scale changes.</li>
	<li>Minor changes to fix some issues when running a German version of Pawn 
	on the German WoW client.</li>
	<li>Updated the samples scales document with newer versions of Emmerald&#39;s 
	feral combat models and ShadowPanther&#39;s AEP model, and added scales for 
	Malan&#39;s Elitist Jerks EP for shamans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The special weapon DPS stats now work.&nbsp; I had broken them in either 
	0.7 or 0.7.1.&nbsp; Existing scales will automatically be corrected; you 
	should not need to re-enter values for those stats.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>If the item link window is open when you make changes to your Pawn 
	scales, it will now be updated immediately, so you can see how your changes 
	will affect the value of the item.</li>
	<li>Added spell hit rating and spell crit rating to the configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	(Oops!)</li>
	<li>Corrected a typo in the description of the melee and ranged crit rating 
	stat.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.7</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Pawn now has a configuration UI!&nbsp; To access it, simply type /pawn 
	in the chat box.&nbsp; (To see the help information that used to be 
	available when you typed /pawn, type /pawn help, or click the /pawn commands 
	button in the configuration UI.)&nbsp; You should no longer need to manually edit your SavedVariables files 
		to configure Pawn.</li>
		<li>The configuration UI is now the official way to make all changes to 
		your Pawn scales.&nbsp; Some of the slash commands that existed in 
		earlier versions of Pawn are gone, since they&#39;re no longer needed: /pawn 
		list, export, import, delete, rename.</li>
	<li>Eliminated that bug where sometimes unenchanted values would 
	disappear from items after a while.&nbsp; The problem seemed to be most 
	commonly linked to use of the world map, but also could occur after zoning 
	or showing the interface options window.</li>
	<li>Scales now appear in alphabetical order on item tooltips.</li>
	<li>Pawn now works with tekKompare and LootLink.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where the value of resilience rating in the default Pawn 
	value scale was 0 instead of 1 as was intended.&nbsp; Scale tags that call resilience rating &quot;Resilience&quot; instead of &quot;ResilienceRating&quot; 
	will now be imported properly.</li>
	<li>The value of ArmorPenetration in the default Pawn value scale is now 
	0.1, based on the latest information on WoWWiki.</li>
	<li>Includes VgerCore 1.0.1.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for items in the guild bank vault.</li>
	<li>In <i>some</i> cases, you can use mods that create fake item tooltips 
	like AtlasLoot and ItemSync along with mods that mangle item tooltips like 
	Rating Buster, and Pawn will now still work.&nbsp; No guarantees that your 
	favorite combination of mods won&#39;t break Pawn, but this should help a lot of 
	people out.</li>
	<li>Finally fixed that bug where items with both durability and an Equip: or 
	Use: line that Pawn didn&#39;t understand would get asterisks on the wrong 
	lines.&nbsp; (For example, Stalker&#39;s Helm of Second Sight has this problem.)</li>
	<li>Added the /pawn space command, which adds a blank space before the item 
	values it adds to tooltips.</li>
	<li>Added a special &quot;stat&quot; called SpeedBaseline.&nbsp; SpeedBaseline isn&#39;t an 
	actual item property, but rather a number to be subtracted from weapon 
	speeds before they&#39;re multiplied by your scale values.&nbsp; For example, if 
	you&#39;re an enhancement shaman who wants to give weapons 1 point for every 0.1 
	second of speed slower than 2.9, use Speed = 10 (1 / 0.1) and SpeedBaseline 
	= 2.9.&nbsp; Weapons slower than 2.9 would instead lose points at the same rate.</li>
	<li>Adjusted the value of the FeralAp stat in the Pawn default scale from 
	0.5 to 0.4 so that feral items in 2.3 will have roughly the same values as 
	they did in 2.2 with the old Pawn default scale and so that the Pawn default 
	scale still roughly mimics item budget formulas.&nbsp; I do not necessarily 
	recommend that you change values in your own scales; your items have been 
	buffed, so it makes sense for their values to go up.</li>
	<li>Weapon skill rating stats have been removed from Pawn and the default 
	Pawn scale, as they&#39;ve been removed from the game in the patch.&nbsp; 
	Existing scales will not be automatically updated to use ExpertiseRating.</li>
	<li>Added Pawn values to gems in the socketing UI.</li>
	<li>Fixed the amount of healing and spell damage received from Teardrop 
	Tourmaline and possibly other gems that previously only gave healing.</li>
	<li>Added support for the new Chaotic Skyfire Diamond.</li>
	<li>Now displays a more readable error message when the embedded mod 
	VgerCore is missing or failed to load.</li>
	<li>Fixed several problems introduced in 2.3:<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 due to the new way that set item 
	tooltips look where Pawn was putting asterisks all over the name of the set, 
	the items in the set, and the set bonuses.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem that appeared in 2.3 where stats on meta gems weren&#39;t 
	always being counted due to requirements now being displayed on gems even 
	when socketed.</li>
		<li>Fixed a bug that appeared in 2.3 only where certain gems and random item 
	properties would appear very strange, such as &quot;+45 Stamina|cfff1a1a1a&quot;, and 
	Pawn would not understand them.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a script error that appeared the first time a recipe was clicked 
	since logging in or resetting your UI.</li>
	<li>Pawn now includes VgerCore 1.0 embedded within the mod; you don&#39;t need a 
	separate VgerCore folder in your AddOns folder.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Supports the 2.2.x live realms and the 2.3 PTRs.&nbsp; 
	(Healing-to-spell-damage and expertise require 2.3, of course.)</li>
	<li>Support for the healing to spell damage conversion.&nbsp; Items that say 
	that they increase healing by 300 and spell damage by 100 will be reported 
	as Healing = 200, SpellPower = 100.&nbsp; Recall that SpellPower <i>includes</i> 
	healing, thus your scale&#39;s value for SpellPower should always be equal to or 
	greater than the value for Healing.</li>
	<li>A new value of .255 was picked for the value of Healing in the default 
	scale, down from .455.&nbsp; With this value, items that had 1/3 of their 
	Healing converted to SpellPower (default value .855) in 2.3 will have the exact 
	same values in 2.3 that they did with the old scale in 2.2 (ignoring rounding errors).&nbsp; Of 
	course, you can and should customize your Pawn scales to fit your needs; 
	generally, healers should <i>not </i>adjust their scales to deal with this 
	change.</li>
	<li>Support for the new ExpertiseRating stat, valued at 1 in the 
	default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale, same as the existing weapon skill 
	stats.&nbsp; Existing scales will not be adjusted to include this stat.&nbsp; 
	If you haven&#39;t customized your scales and want to reset them, use /pawn resetscales.<ul>
		<li>Weapon skill ratings are currently still supported so you can use 
		Pawn 0.6.1 on the live realms too.&nbsp; They&#39;ll be removed in a later 
		version.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Support for many more healing enchantments, inscriptions, spellthread, 
	and so forth.</li>
	<li>Craftable items for which you can learn recipes from trainers will now 
	get Pawn values.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.6</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem introduced in beta 1 where Pawn would display 
	an error message in the chat window whenever hovering over a ring with 
	Enchant Ring - Weapon Might.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to customize the colors that your scales will use when 
	printed.&nbsp; For example, you could have your DPS value show up in orange, 
	and your healing value show up in green.&nbsp; This is an advanced feature 
	that probably will never get its own UI or slash command.&nbsp; See the 
	section titled &quot;Changing the color of a scale&quot; for more information.</li>
	<li>Importing a scale tag that has the exact same name as a scale you 
	already have will update the old scale to match the values in the scale tag.&nbsp; 
	All of the values in the old scale will be deleted.&nbsp; (In previous 
	versions, Pawn would just fail and warn you that you can&#39;t overwrite an 
	existing scale.&nbsp; There is no longer a warning.)</li>
	<li>Weapon stats have been overhauled!&nbsp; Old scales will work, but now 
	advanced users have a variety of new options for assigning values to 
	weapons.</li>
	<li>New stats: MeleeMinDamage, MeleeMaxDamage, MeleeSpeed, MeleeDps, 
	MainHandMinDamage, MainHandMaxDamage, MainHandSpeed, MainHandDps, 
	OffHandMinDamage, OffHandMaxDamage, OffHandSpeed, OffHandDps, 
	OneHandMinDamage, OneHandMaxDamage, OneHandSpeed, OneHandDps, 
	TwoHandMinDamage, TwoHandMaxDamage, TwoHandSpeed, TwoHandDps, 
	RangedMinDamage, RangedMaxDamage, RangedSpeed, RangedDps.&nbsp; Generally, 
	you&#39;ll only use a few of these, and not give values to all of them.</li>
	<li>New stats: MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t care about 
	which slot or weapon type it is, just use MinDamage, MaxDamage, Speed, 
	and/or Dps.&nbsp; Dps is now calculated to full precision (say, 41.333 
	instead of 41.3) instead of rounded to one decimal place.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon damage enchantments (Striking and Impact).</li>
	<li>Added support for ranged weapon scopes.</li>
	<li>Fixed a problem where certain items with suffixes would show unusually low unenchanted
	values (their stats would be read as 0).  For example, Chimaerascale Legguards of the Bandit
	exhibited this problem.</li>
	<li>Added support for Black Morass instance-bound items (beacons).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for haste rating and spell haste rating, which were added as passive
	item bonuses on Black Temple equipment.  (Iron Counterweight is also supported.)  These two
	stats (HasteRating, SpellHasteRating) are valued at 1 each on the default Pawn scale; existing
	Pawn scales won't be affected.  Use /pawn resetscales to delete all of your scales and replace them
	with the default one.</li>
	<li>Added support for armor penetration ("Your attacks ignore X of your opponent's armor").
	This stat (ArmorPenetration) is not valued in the default Pawn scale.</li>
	<li>Added support for Karazhan, Stratholme, and Tempest Keep instance-bound items.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for the new gold profession recipe links in WoW 2.1.&nbsp; 
	(Pawn won&#39;t try to read them or put asterisks all over them.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added working support for the Savagery weapon enchantment, and untested support
	for Potency, Soulfrost, and Sunfire.</li>
	<li>Added support for EquipCompare 2.10.&nbsp; (This may break compatibility 
	with older versions of EquipCompare; please use the latest version.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Updated for WoW patch 2.1.</li>
	<li>Added support for Blizzard&#39;s new Currently Equipped functionality 
	(shift-hover an item).</li>
	<li>LinkWrangler support.</li>
	<li>Fixed a bug where stats in certain situations (gems with multiple stats 
	on one gem, socket bonuses, etc.) wouldn&#39;t get shown in the /pawn debug on 
	output.&nbsp; This did not affect calculation; it was just a debug display error.</li>
	<li>Expanded the amount of information Pawn returns in the debug output.</li>
	<li>Added support for Enchant Boots: Vitality.</li>
	<li>Slightly updated a few of the default &quot;Pawn value&quot; scale&#39;s numbers.&nbsp; 
	This will not affect existing scales, even if you haven&#39;t changed any of the 
	defaults.&nbsp; If you want to get the new scale, you can wipe out your 
	existing scale(s) with /pawn resetscales.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.5</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Requires VgerCore 0.4.  (This is included with the mod.  Pawn will warn you if you
	are using an older version of VgerCore.)</li>
	<li>Pawn can now show unenchanted values for items in addition to the 
	regular enchanted values, and this is enabled by default.&nbsp; You can turn 
	it off with /pawn unenchanted off.&nbsp; This feature only works for real 
	tooltips, and not fake tooltips from an item database mod.</li>
	<li>Added an option to control the number of digits of precision Pawn uses 
	to display item values in tooltips.&nbsp; By default this is 1 (&quot;3.1&quot;), but 
	you can set it to any number between 0 (&quot;3&quot;) and 4 (&quot;3.1416&quot;) with /pawn 
	digits #.</li>
	<li>Corrected the value of frost resistance in the default Pawn scale to 1 
	(was 4).</li>
	<li>Pawn scale tags now have spaces inside of the parentheses by default.&nbsp; 
	This is to prevent certain scale tags from turning into emoticons when 
	posted to certain forums.&nbsp; (For example, if your scale tag ended in &quot;RedSocket=8)&quot;, 
	the 8) would turn into an emoticon on certain forums.)&nbsp; Old and current 
	versions of Pawn will accept the scale with or without the extra spaces. </li>
	<li>Lots of work was done to prepare for Pawn translations into other languages.&nbsp; 
	I may have made a mistake in this conversion and introduced cases where (*) 
	shows up where they didn&#39;t before; hopefully not.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added support for gun, bow, and crossbow skill ratings.</li>
	<li>Added support for MultiTips.</li>
	<li>Added support for items that list stats as &quot;Stat +X&quot; instead of &quot;+X 
	Stat&quot;, namely the epic gems.&nbsp; Gems that only provided primary stats, 
	such as Seer&#39;s Chrysoprase, already worked, but others such as Rune Covered 
	Chrysoprase didn&#39;t work until this change.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.4</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Added scale tags!&nbsp; Scale tags are chunks of text that you can use 
	to share Pawn scales with friends, guildmates, and others on forums, similar 
	to how you can share talent specs today by passing around a link to the WoW 
	talent calculator.&nbsp; You can copy a scale tag and then post it on your 
	guild forums, and then another player can copy that tag and paste it into 
	their game to automatically add your scale to their copy of Pawn, without 
	logging out of the game or changing files in Notepad.&nbsp; To export a 
	scale tag so you can share it with others, use the /pawn export command.&nbsp; 
	To import someone else&#39;s scale tag and add it to your own scales, use the 
	/pawn import command.</li>
	<li>Added new slash commands: /pawn list, export, import, delete, and 
	rename.&nbsp; See &quot;Slash commands&quot; in Readme.htm for more details.</li>
	<li>Added support for weapon skill ratings (including unarmed and feral 
	combat).&nbsp; (They have been added to the default Pawn scale, but if you 
	care about weapon skill ratings you must add them to your custom scales 
	manually.)</li>
	<li>Fixed the /pawn resetscales command so that it would delete all of your 
	scales before recreating the default one named Pawn value, as was intended.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Hovering over an enchanted Item X immediately after hovering over an 
	unenchanted Item X will now recalculate the values for the second item 
	instead of just displaying the ones for the first item.&nbsp; This should 
	work for all pairs of items that differ only by enchantments and gems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.3</h3>
<ul>
	<li>To read statistics, Pawn now makes a copy of the tooltip and reads from 
	that whenever possible, which allows it to read tooltips that have been 
	mangled by other mods.&nbsp; Examples of mods that do this are Mendeleev and 
	Rating Buster.&nbsp; (Certain mods that use custom tooltips, such as 
	ItemSync, don&#39;t support this; Pawn may still conflict with mods that modify 
	those custom tooltips.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ItemSync support, including using ItemSync with AtlasLoot.&nbsp; Pawn 
	will calculate and display values for ItemSync&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>EQCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EQCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>Item level display should work just about everywhere now, instead of 
	just in certain places.&nbsp; (In previous versions, it worked for inventory 
	items, but not chat item links.&nbsp; Now it works on both.)</li>
	<li>A new option has been added to display the item ID for items you come 
	across, /pawn ids on.</li>
	<li>The default is now to hide the asterisks (*) from items that don&#39;t have 
	any values for any of your scales.&nbsp; So, for example, Hearthstone and 
	potions won&#39;t display the asterisk.&nbsp; You can change this behavior using 
	/pawn asterisks [ on | auto | off ].</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed a problem in 0.2 where Pawn wouldn&#39;t work if you&#39;d never used 
	version 0.1 before.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.2</h3>
<ul>
	<li>EquipCompare support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	EquipCompare&#39;s tooltips.</li>
	<li>AtlasLoot support.&nbsp; Pawn will calculate and display values for 
	instance drops when Atlas and AtlasLoot are installed.</li>
	<li>Outfitter support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the lines 
	that Outfitter adds to tooltips of items used in one or more gear sets.</li>
	<li>MonkeyQuest support.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t actually observed it happening in 
	the past, but this change should prevent MonkeyQuest&#39;s item tooltip 
	annotations from affecting Pawn.</li>
	<li>MobInfo-2 support.&nbsp; Pawn will no longer conflict with the drop rate 
	information that MobInfo-2 adds to items.&nbsp; (This problem manifested 
	itself both as unnecessary asterisks added to tooltips, and also as an 
	&quot;attempted to concatenate a nil value&quot; error.)</li>
	<li>Added APIs to create and change Pawn scales while you&#39;re still logged 
	in.&nbsp; These will eventually be used to build a configuration UI.&nbsp; 
	If you <i>really</i> want to, you can use them from the chat box to change 
	Pawn scales while logged into the game.</li>
	<li>Included a new file "Sample scales.htm" containing (you guessed it) some
	sample scales that you can use to get started creating your own.  I'll add to this
	over time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Version 0.1</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The first released beta version of Pawn.&nbsp; The code is stable and 
	the remaining bugs are mostly just to-do items.&nbsp; I&#39;ll get around to 
	them eventually.</li>
	<li>Not heavily optimized for performance.</li>
	<li>No configuration UI.&nbsp; (Hope you like Notepad!)</li>
</ul>
	<h2>Known issues and bugs</h2>
<p>Check here first if you think you&#39;ve found a new bug; maybe I already know 
about it.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Weapon damage is actually stored in the game with more precision than is 
	displayed.&nbsp; For example, Gavel of Naaru Blessings says in-game that it 
	does 16-117 damage, but according to the game files, it does 16.12-116.12 
	damage.&nbsp; This causes Pawn to report its DPS as being slightly higher 
	than the in-game tooltip says.</li>
	<li>It&#39;s been reported that Fiery and other weapon damage enchantments are 
	only counting for the basic DPS stat, and not for the specialized DPS stats 
	like melee DPS.</li>
	<li>Item links that you click that aren&#39;t already in your game cache show 
	the message &quot;Retrieving item information&quot; and then when the item appears, there 
	are no Pawn values until the next time you show that item.&nbsp; This type of 
	problem has existed forever, and also affects the Blizzard feedback UI 
	line, but still I&#39;d like to find a way to solve it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Visual issues in Wrath of the Lich King</h3>
<p>There are a few issues with the appearance of certain parts of the Pawn UI in 
Wrath of the Lich King that I won&#39;t bother resolving until around the time that 
WoW patch 3.0 goes live.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The pretty white divider bars on the Compare tab are extremely faint on 
	Wrath.</li>
	<li>The dark areas on the Compare tab are too dark on Wrath.</li>
	<li>The silver highlight that shows which of two items on the Compare tab is 
	better does not appear on Wrath.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future versions</h2>
<p>There are many features that I&#39;d like to add in future versions of Pawn, 
besides fixing issues listed in the &quot;known problems&quot; above.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Tradeskill items in Wrath of the Lich King do not always get Pawn values 
	right now; I&#39;ll fix this.</li>
	<li>Unsocketed gems currently cannot be placed in the Compare interface.&nbsp; 
	I will probably change this, unless I add a specific gem tab.</li>
	<li>Around Wrath of the Lich King&#39;s release, I&#39;ll increase the values of all 
	sockets in the default scale, and add a similar value to colorless sockets.</li>
	<li>Additional ways you might be able to get to the Compare tab in the 
	future:<ul>
		<li>I could add little Pawn buttons to item link windows.&nbsp; I 
		decided not to do this because I thought they&#39;d be obnoxious.</li>
		<li>I could add a &quot;compare this item with what I already have&quot; button to 
		loot roll windows to make it more obvious than just right-clicking the 
		icon.&nbsp; Or, I could even just add a little comparison window that 
		sticks to the side.</li>
		<li>In addition to the &quot;currently equipped&quot; buttons in the lower-left, I 
		could also remember the best 1-2 items you&#39;ve ever equipped for a given 
		slot type, and display those there too.&nbsp; This helps those with 
		multiple gear sets (for example, shamans with a resto set and an enhance 
		set).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Right now, the Compare tab only shows stats that have nonzero values in 
	your scales.&nbsp; I could add an option to show all stats, though that 
	would make it a lot harder to use at a glance—weapons have a lot of stats, 
	including 8-12 stats just for tracking damage and speed, plus any real stats 
	on the item.</li>
	<li>I might change the Compare tab so that it still shows item stats even if 
	there&#39;s only one item.</li>
	<li>I could improve the Compare tab to support comparing multiple sets of 
	items at once.&nbsp; (For example, an entire gear set versus another 
	person&#39;s entire gear set.)</li>
	<li>I still haven&#39;t optimized some parts of Pawn for performance.&nbsp; One 
	thing that I could do is collect statistics on how often various item stats 
	are used, and then reorder them in the files so that the most common stats 
	are checked first, and the rarest stats are checked last.&nbsp; That might 
	be difficult and make translation much more challenging, though.</li>
	<li>I could add an option to hide values from items you could never equip.&nbsp; 
	For example, shamans could have values hidden on swords, sigils, plate 
	armor, and wands.</li>
	<li>There are other things I could annotate tooltips with, but I&#39;m not sure 
	which things I&#39;ll do, since some might conflict with other mods or require a 
	lot of configuration.</li>
	<li>I could enhance the socketing UI to show which colors of gems Pawn 
	recommends socketing.</li>
	<li>I could improve compatibility with RatingBuster by looking for the color 
	it uses for its text.</li>
	<li>I&#39;d like to improve VgerCore so that the messages that Pawn occasionally 
	displays that start with &quot;ERROR:&quot; only show up for me by default, or at 
	least can be turned off.</li>
	<li>Pawn could keep track of the best item of each type (Helm, Bracers, 
	Trinket, ...) that you&#39;ve ever equipped, and then show you how the item 
	you&#39;re hovering over compares to that.&nbsp; There would be one &quot;best item&quot; 
	per scale, per item type (two for rings and trinkets).&nbsp; Or, it could just show a difference between 
	the hovered item and the equipped item.&nbsp; This would be useful for 
	evaluating gear sets that you&#39;re not currently wearing—for example, if a DPS 
	cloak drops but you&#39;re in your tanking gear.</li>
	<li>One very cool feature would be a way to automatically share Pawn scale 
	tags with another player through an in-game whisper.&nbsp; Something like 
	/pawn share Vger &lt;scale name&gt;.&nbsp; Or, there could just be a window 
	where you could type another player&#39;s name to see their Pawn scales if they 
	use Pawn... sort of like a Scalesteal spell.</li>
	<li>Long-term (and I really mean long-term... this would be a ton of work), 
	I&#39;d love to add a &quot;shopping list&quot; feature to Pawn.&nbsp; When you saw items 
	drop in raids, linked in trade chat, or browsed through item database mods, 
	you could pick the ones you liked and add them to a shopping list.&nbsp; 
	Pawn would remember that item, let you see it whenever you wanted, and show 
	you which ones were best for your various gear sets.&nbsp; For example, Pawn 
	could remember that you have the Sha&#39;tar exalted healing mace Gavel of Pure 
	Light, but you really want Shard of the Virtuous from Maiden.&nbsp; Pawn 
	could show you that the Shard would be 23.4 points better on your healing 
	scale, and update that number whenever you change your scales.</li>
	<li>Down the road, I might also like to add a way for people to assign values to 
	specific item effects and enchantments.&nbsp; For example, Spellsurge is a 
	useful weapon enchantment for casters, but Pawn doesn&#39;t give it a value.&nbsp; 
	Right now, you have to rely on the asterisks and intuition to properly 
	evaluate Spellsurge versus another weapon enchantment.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t 
	decided how this would work just yet...&nbsp; Is it part of a single scale, 
	or a per-character option?&nbsp; Does it assign stats (Intellect +30) or 
	points (Score +30)?&nbsp; And what&#39;s the point of assigning it a value when 
	you&#39;d generally use unenchanted value in these situations anyway?</li>
	<li>I could move scales and settings to be account-wide settings instead of 
	per-character, and then scales and options could be shared between 
	characters.&nbsp; That would probably only be useful for bank alts.</li>
</ul>
