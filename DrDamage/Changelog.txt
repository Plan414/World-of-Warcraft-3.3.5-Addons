- General:
- 3.3.3 changes
- Hermorrhage damage bonus is now correctly mitigated by armor
- Added Strength of Wrynn and Hellscream's Warsong
- Simplified options for target level selection; it's now either current target level, +1, +2 or +3. There's no real need to have options for -4 to +10.
- Clarified target armor options as well; choices are automatic/manual (uses known armor values for bosses and training dummies, plus manual value for the rest), boss (always asumes boss armor), manual (uses manually set armor) and none (no armor is taken into account).
- Fixed an issue in the Russian client where the priest skill Vampiric Embrace was mistaken for Embrace of the Vampyr (-100% healing) due to identical translations

- Improved extra effect display: Now uses the format Avg (Min-Max)
- Allow damage absorption spells to benefit from Strength of Wrynn/Hellscream's warsong

- Add cast time to the first spell display type selection due to request
