ClassLoot By Pneumatus | Tenin/Ismo @ EU-Turalyon Alliance

This addon is an in-game representation of Kaliban's Class Loot List (http://www.wow-loot.com). Kaliban's Class Loot List
provides ratings for all raid loot with respect to it's suitability for different class/spec combinations. Classic WoW
raid gear is rated for each class between 0 to 5 stars, however this addon disregards any rating below 3 stars to reduce
the data-set. Outlands and Northrend-based raid gear is split into Primary, Secondary and Tertiary priority which is 
displayed in-gameusing 5 stars, 4 stars and 3 stars respectively. This addon purely displays the ratings given by Kaliban, 
therefore if you consider a rating to be unjust or incorrect on his website please take it up with him, not me!

Class Loot information can be accessed in two ways, either via item tooltips or through the slash commands.
Item tooltips contain the class loot rating along with the instances the item drops in, and finally the
bosses that the item drops from.

You can check the loot of any raid item by using the following slash commands:
	/cl check <item link>  -- Personal item check (only visible to you)
	/cl gcheck <item link> -- Item check broadcast to Guild Chat
	/cl rcheck <item link> -- Item check broadcast to Raid Chat
	
Configuration of this addon may be performed through the Options -> Interface -> AddOns -> ClassLoot window.

If you notice any inconsistencies between the in-game data and the website data please let me know the item name and I'll
look into it!
