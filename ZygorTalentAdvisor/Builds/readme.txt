Place your builds in files Build01.lua, Build02.lua, ... in this directory, to have them auto-loaded and startup.
You may place multiple builds in one file.
The syntax of a build file is as follows:

	if not ZygorTalentAdvisor then return end
	ZygorTalentAdvisor:RegisterBuild(class,name,talents)
	ZygorTalentAdvisor:RegisterBuild(class,name,talents)
	ZygorTalentAdvisor:RegisterBuild(class,name,talents)

with:
	class - one of "HUNTER","MAGE","PALADIN","DRUID","WARRIOR","ROGUE","DEATHKNIGHT" for character builds,
		 or one of "PET Tenacity","PET Ferocity","PET Cunning" for pets.
	name - the title of the build.
	talents - the list of talents, in the format:
		{"Talent","Talent","Next Talent","Yet another talent", .....}
		 - named talents, to be taken in proper order, you can put each on a new line if you want
		 
		Talents can also be supplied as a string of digits, "532122030000000000000225100202001312..."
		 - this is the Blizzard talent calculator format; talents are applied left-to-right, with no manual tweaking possible, though.
