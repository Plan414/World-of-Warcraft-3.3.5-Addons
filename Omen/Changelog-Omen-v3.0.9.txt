Tag release v3.0.9


--------------------

Xinhuan:
	- Update TOC and version.
	- Add an option to make Omen click-through (non-interactive), defaults off.
	- Optimized the bar animation code significantly.
	- Fix bar backgrounds not being set to the inverted color on login if the "Invert Bar/Text Colors" setting is on. This wasn't noticable if the bar label color was the default white text with 100% alpha.
