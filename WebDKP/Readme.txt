March 18, 2009
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Removed !listall as it was causing disconnects
* Added Death Knights to the whisper filter
* Added Emblem of Valor and Emblem of Heroism to the ignore list
* Added Item links for the bid announcements.  So there is no longer a need to relink the loot after starting bidding.
* Fixed the options savings.  The WebDKP options were overwritten each time you synchronized with the server.  This is now changed.
* Modified the ingame version displayed to say 2.9G
* Updated the help file to reflect the removal of !listall

- Whisper DKP!
  Other members can now whisper you to have you automattically whisper them back with information
  (Whispers are hidden from you, so you dont' get bogged down in info)

  Commands that you can be whispered:
  !help - sends them a list of commands
  !dkp  - sends the person who whispered you their current dkp
  !list - Lists the dkp of everyone in your current group
  !listall - Lists the dkp of everyone in your dkp table

  The two list commands can have class names append to them to limit them to certain classes. 
  For example:
  !list hunter           - Shows the dkp of all the hunters in the current group
  !listall hunter rogue  - Shows the dkp of all the hunters and rogues in the guild
