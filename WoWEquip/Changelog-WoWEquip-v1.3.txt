Tag v1.3


--------------------

Xinhuan:
	- Update WoWEquip version number to 1.3
	- Fix errors when trying to link items in chat that due to patch 3.3.5. The fix is backwards compatible.
Erik Broes:
	- Added 'Enchant Gloves - Angler'.
	Updated 'Enchant Gloves - Fishing' to +5 fishing (existing locales are updated).
Xinhuan:
	- Add workaround for menuitems appearing disabled because Blizzard added "self:SetFrameLevel(2);" into their OnLoad template code in the default UI which causes the menu buttons to be BELOW the menu itself.
	- You can now link items and enchants into the AH search editbox from anywhere in WoWEquip you can link an item or enchant (including the menus).
	- Gem slots are now linkable in chat and AH search editbox.
Erik Broes:
	- Added 'Rune of the Nerubian Carapace'
