A large pack of them, many more than we can handle alone, have infested the woods south of the guard tower yonder.  Another group has infested the areas near Stone Cairn Lake to the east.The Stormwind Army will commend whomever helps kill them.  Bring me their painted gnoll armbands as proof of your deed.1623The mighty bear Ursangous is no more!The small quarter-crescent emblem on its paw indicates that this beast was trained by the night elves to prowl the forest in search of their enemies. There is no telling how many of your Horde allies fell to this creature.The paw should be brought to Tarkan at Silverwind Refuge. He will be pleased that such a weapon has been removed from the enemy's arsenal.24The once swift Shadumbra now lies still as you claim victory over it.This legenday creature is dear to the night elves. Its head should serve as an intimidating trophy, and as a sign of the end of the Alliance in Ashenvale.Captain Goggath at Hellscream's Watch will no doubt be delighted to receive the head of the slain nightsaber.25You should've seen it, !The elves thought Silverwind to be impenetrable. With its heavy defenses and their army of water elementals, they were almost right.Almost.One of our mages was able to summon a twisted elemental designed to send the others into a chaotic rage.Ahh, the looks on their faces!Unfortunately, the mage who summoned it fell in battle. Now I need someone to bring down our creation.35If you are concerned that the rumors of murlocs are true, then do this -- travel to the eastern Elwynn bridge and speak with Guard Thomas.  He has been stationed at the bridge for the past week and will know the state of the area.I have here a Stormwind charger that will take you to Guard Thomas. Let me know if you wish to make use of the horse.37A few days ago we sent two Guards, Rolf and Malakai, to investigate along the river, and they have not yet returned.  To complete my report, I must know what happened to those men.Travel north along the river and find the guards... or their remains.40, there's a new threat in Elwynn Forest!  Murlocs are swimming up the streams of eastern Elwynn, scaring away fish and attacking gentle folk!I warned Marshal Dughan, but he's more worried about the gnolls and the bandits.  He's not convinced that the murlocs are a danger.Please, , speak to Dughan and persuade him to send more troops to the east!45Upon further searching the area, you find webbed footprints leading east along the shore of Stone Cairn Lake.  In the distance to the east, you can just barely see a Murloc village.Perhaps Rolf's fate ended there...46The Stormwind Army has placed a bounty on murloc lurkers and foragers in Elwynn.  Slaughter them and bring Guard Thomas their torn murloc fins, and the Stormwind Army will reward you well.The murlocs have built a village at Stone Cairn Lake north of here, and another to the south where the stream forks.47The kobolds in these parts sometimes carry Gold Dust on them.  I could really use the stuff - bring me a load of it and I'll give you the best price in town...best price in town!You can find kobolds in the Fargodeep Mine to the south, and around the Jasperlode Mine to the northeast.52Hail, .  Wild animals are growing more and more aggressive the farther we get from Goldshire, and the Eastvale Logging Camp suffers nearly constant attacks from wolves and bears!We could use your help out here.54, you are a  with proven interest in the security of Northshire.  You are now tasked with the protection of the surrounding Elwynn Forest.If you accept this duty, then I have prepared papers that must be delivered to Marshal Dughan in Goldshire.  Goldshire lies along the southern road, past the border gates.59For your shrewdness and valor, I have a marker here that is good for one piece of armor.  I want you to take it to Sara Timberlain at the Eastvale Logging Camp.  Give her the marker, and she will fashion the armor for you.  And after you receive it, , use it in the defense of Elwynn.Eastvale is just east of this post across the bridge.60Hello, !  Do you have a moment?My brother and I run an apothecary in Stormwind, and I'm here to gather large candles for their wax.  Can you help me?You can get large candles from kobolds, and I hear rumors that kobolds are infesting the Elwynn mines... the Fargodeep Mine to the south and Jasperlode Mine to the east.  I suggest looking for candles in one of those places.62The mine in Northshire isn't the only one with problems!  I have reports that the Fargodeep Mine in Elwynn has also become a haven for Kobolds.Explore the mine and confirm these reports, then return to me.  The mine is almost due south of Goldshire, between the Stonefield and Maclure homesteads.71Now that you have both medallions, deliver them to Guard Thomas at the bridge so that he might know the fate of his murdered guards.76Thanks to you we know the Fargodeep Mine is infested with kobolds.  Now we need a scout to investigate the more distant Jasperlode Mine.Explore Jasperlode and confirm any kobold presence.  To reach the mine, travel east along the road until you reach the Tower of Azora.  From the tower, head north and you'll find the mine in the foothills.83The thugs in Elwynn wear linen which I can use to make fine linen goods.Bring me linen scraps and I'll use them to fashion something for you.You'll find those lawless criminals in pockets across Elwynn Forest.84Here you go.  And when you give this pie to that Billy, you tell him I hope he chokes on it!85I lost my necklace and I think that guttersnipe Billy Maclure took it!  He's usually scuttling like a rat around the Maclure Vineyards east of here. Get my necklace back for me and you'll warm an old widow's heart.86Maybe if I got a pie, I could tell you who has that necklace.  And you know, I think that old Bernice lady at that other farm makes great Pork Belly Pies... Maybe if you gave her some tender boar meat from the boars that hang around our farms, and told her what it was for, she'd bake up a pie for you.87I was playing near the Fargodeep Mine, and I think I dropped, er...I mean I saw, the old lady's necklace.  Don't ask me how it got there...it wasn't me!Well anyway, I saw this big, gold-toothed kobold pick up the necklace and run back to his den above the mine.  Go find that kobold and you'll find the necklace, I swear!88The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess. The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies!It just so happens that she's here now! Princess must die! Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time!You'll find Princess smack dab in the middle of our watermelon patch. Get her!106Oh, I'm cursed!  My heart belongs to Tommy Joe Stonefield, but our families are bitter enemies.  So I can't see him, even though my eyes ache to gaze upon that handsome face!Please, take this letter and give it to Tommy Joe.  He's usually at the river to the west of the Stonefield Farm, which is due west of here.107I bet William Pestle has a potion to unite our two young lovers!Here, take this note to William.  He's staying at the Lion's Pride Inn in Goldshire.111Please, , talk with my Gramma.  If anyone can find a way to bring me together with Maybell, she can.She's inside our house east of here.112I can make an invisibility liquor for Maybell, so she can slip away from the Maclure Vineyards and go to Tommy Joe.  But to make the liquor, I need some crystal kelp.Although the kelp usually grows in the ocean... sometimes murlocs collect it.  See if the murlocs near Crystal Lake have any.  Crystal Lake is just east of Goldshire.114Take this invisibility liquor to young Maybell.  It should last long enough for her to visit Tommy Joe.123This note is a schedule with a list of days and times when a person -- described only as \"The Collector\" -- will receive a shipment of gold from the mines in Elwynn Forest.From the schedule, it looks as if the Collector resides near the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch in eastern Elwynn.This sounds important.  You should report it to Marshal McCree at Eastvale Logging Camp.147If the \"Collector\" is taking gold from our mines then he's stealing from the kingdom!  Bring the Collector to justice, and bring me the ring mentioned in the pickup schedule you gave me.  It may tell us whom the Collector is working for...That Pickup Schedule says the Collector is hiding out at the Brackwell Pumpkin Patch.  You should search for him there.171You have been so very kind to me, .  I never dreamed that I'd have so much fun during Children's Week.  Thank you.I wish all the orphans were lucky enough to get to do the stuff we did. Do you think we could find Craggle Wobbletop again and get a foam sword rack from him? I think he's still pushing that cart in the Canals outside the Trade District. That way, everyone else at the orphanage could do something fun too!After that, it'll be time for me to go home.172You're willing to help us here at the orphanage?  Bless you, friend; your aid during Children's Week will be invaluable.Take this whistle.  You will only be able to use it for a short amount of time - typically not longer than Children's Week itself.  When you use it, you will be able to talk with the child you've agreed to look after.  Using it again will dismiss the child.By all means  - use the whistle and meet your ward!  I'm sure the child will be most eager to meet you.176Wanted: HoggerA huge gnoll, Hogger, is prowling the woods in southwestern Elwynn.  He has overpowered all attempts at his capture.The Stormwind Army has placed a generous bounty on the Gnoll.  To earn the reward, bounty hunters should venture into the woods and deal with the beast.182The trolls're acting up.  More than usual, I'd say.  We've seen them put together war parties before, but this time it's... different.What matters most, however, is the continued protection of Anvilmar.  I've no intention to let these trolls flank Anvilmar while its attention is turned towards troggs.  Go thin their ranks a bit.  They need to know that we're still not without defenses.184This is an old deed to an expanse of farmlands within Westfall.  It is signed by a Theodore Furlbrow and cosigned by his wife, Verna.  And on the back of the deed are hastily scrawled words:\"We leaned on Furlbrow and got his deed.  Thought it might be handy if you wanted to forge one of these for your own place.The Furlbrows won't give us trouble.  Last I saw them they were on their way out of Westfall, stuck with a broken wagon.\"You think the Furlbrows might want their deed back...185When I was but a young girl, my father trained me in the art of tiger hunting.You'll find the young felines much easier to track and slay.  One can often find young tigers near the expedition camp.Test your tracking skills and see if you can hunt some of the beasts down.  Start your hunt near our camp, to the south.186Young tigers are one thing.  Fully-grown cats are another.  Hunting the grown Stranglethorn tigers will prove an even greater challenge.The adult cats normally spend their days south of Kurzen's Compound, east of the river.187Elder Stranglethorn tigers are the strongest of the bunch.  More than one   has seen  own demise at the tip of those razor-sharp teeth and heavy claws.Ajeck will be thrilled to know that you have bested them.  The largest pack of these elders can be found to the south, near the Sundering, on the border of the Cape of Stranglethorn.188Legends speak of an elusive tigress... a feline so powerful that she dwarfs even the elder males.  The hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition have hunted for her without success.  Many of them have fallen prey to her raking claws, their bodies now decaying at the foot of her hill, north of Grom'gol.They call the beast Sin'Dall.You resolve to do what no  has done before: hunt, kill, and claim the paw of Sin'Dall.190If you want to be a part of the hunt with this crack group under Hemet Jr.'s leadership, you're going to need to prove yourself an able panther hunter.  You should start out easy: just focus on the young panthers for now.  As you improve and gain experience as a hunter, you will undoubtedly find increasingly dangerous quarry.Start by heading east.  Return to me when you are a master panther hunter.191The youngest panthers fell easily before you.  Panthers that have come of age will naturally be stronger, and quicker, and more difficult to defeat.Larger panther tracks lead to the west.192Now the hard part.  As panthers grow older, they become more wily, blending in with their environment and becoming difficult to spot.  These cunning panthers are known by the name \"shadowmaw\", for their tendency to suddenly appear out of the darkness... with a waiting mouth full of teeth.If you want to prove yourself as a true panther hunter, shadowmaws are the only way to do so.  They prowl to the southeast, across the river.193You've almost proven yourself to be a master hunter of panthers.  Yet there is one panther which has eluded your grasp.Songs are sung about a mighty panther by the name of Bhag'thera.  You will see if you can use your skills to kill the great beast.Bringing the Fang of Bhag'thera to Erlgadin should be proof enough that you are a master panther hunter.194So you think your hunting skills are in tip-top shape?  I can put them to the test in a jiffy.  Head out into that jungle and kill ten Stranglethorn raptors.  We'll see just how much of a big game hunter you are.And no, I won't tell you where you can find them!  Locating the beasts is half the challenge.Okay, go west.195It is time to step up the challenge.  Venturing into the jungle and bagging 10 lashtail raptors should be sufficient.  They will certainly be stronger than the raptors you have already disposed of.The lashtail raptors mainly stay southeast of here, near the Kal'ai Ruins.196A particularly cagey brand of raptor, known by locals as the \"Jungle Stalker\", prowls the forests to the south, across the river.  They are far more difficult to track down and kill than the other breeds you've been trying your luck at.Killing these Jungle Stalkers will undoubtedly make for a good tale around the fire.197Before returning to Nesingwary's Expedition, you will have to complete the impossible: hunt the raptor that no other hunter has been able to capture.  That beast goes by the name of Tethis, and he's been known to terrorize the southeastern corner of Northern Stranglethorn.Bringing Tethis' talon back to that dwarf hunter should be proof that you are no ordinary .208, you are a hunter worthy of our company.  From the battlefields of Lordaeron to the deepest jungle, I have rarely witnessed such prowess with weaponry as you have demonstrated.You have killed the ferocious Sin'Dall, the elusive Bhag'thera, and the treacherous Tethis.  But the true prize is the head of King Bangalash.  That white tiger is the reason I am here... yet still, he taunts me from his roost to the south.  Kill King Bangalash and your hunting prowess is proven to be second to none.216The Thistlefur furbolgs are threatening our expansion!  Thistlefur Village to our west blocks the way between us here and the Splintertree Post.  It's a path that would circumvent the village of Astranaar; without it, we give the Alliance an extra expansion path., we must not allow... an expansion path gap!Proceed to Thistlefur Village and thin out the furbolgs.  You will be given compensation for this task, but more importantly you will be doing your duty for the Horde!218Soren did well to send you out on recon.  That's some good information you have right there.Trouble is, this just adds more work for us to do.  The trolls, confused as they are right now, still would like to kick the dwarves right out of Coldridge.  And I'm certainly not going to let some fiery demon turn our snowy valley into a mountain lake.The troll leader, his servants, and the fire creature should all be in the cave to the southeast.  Take 'em all out.239The Garrison on our western border sends word of increasing gnoll and thief activity.  They're requesting we send more Stormwind soldiers... but we just don't have any to spare!If you can help, we could use it.  Go and speak with Deputy Rainer at the Westbrook Garrison and see what he needs done.The Garrison is down the road to the west.  After you cross the bridge over the small brook it will be to the right.264Filthy scum! Leaves me for his damn crusade. Because \"the Light is the most important thing we have against the threats the undead pose.\"Well, what about his children?! What about ME?! Night after night I sat patiently waiting for him... always second to his blasted duty!Well, witness what \"justice\" brings you, ! He's dead and I'm bearing the very thing he was trying to stop!Take this piece of junk and put it on his tomb at the Sepulcher. I want nothing to do with it anymore... or him!270Years ago, the Third Fleet of Kul Tiras sunk along the coasts of The Wetlands, an expanse of marsh north of the dwarven kingdom of Ironforge.  Aboard one ship was a load of Lightforge Iron.This metal is precious to us, for items crafted from it strike with holy truth.  If you are to face Morbent Fel, then you will need such a weapon.Go to Menethil Harbor and speak with my dwarven colleague Glorin Steelbrow.  If that lost metal can be found, he'll know where to look.273It's not too late though, you're welcome to go look for Huldar. He can't have made it very far, strong as they are, Miran and Saean can only move so fast laden down with those barrels.They're taking the normal route to the site, leaving south out of town and following the curve of the Loch.Shouldn't have a problem finding them unless they've already gotten there.291Excellent! Take my report to Senator Barin Redstone. He's a sour type, so don't let his less-than-sunny disposition get to you. He's in Ironforge, in the chamber where King Magni holds court.Don't know the way to Ironforge? Take the road out of Kharanos north, cross the bridge, then follow the road east--there are large banners flanking the road--up the mountainside.By the way, if you might avoid mentioning how you assisted me? Can't let them think I'm not working hard out here, you know?301We'll need approval to get Ironband more blastpowder. You'll have to take his report to the Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge.Here's the report. Give it to Prospector Stormpike, and don't forget to duck after you deliver it. Stormpike is hotheaded, and he won't be happy to hear of Ironband's slow progress at the site.You'll find Stormpike in the Assembly of Explorers.302If Ironband still needs blastpowder, then by Magni he'll have it!  I sent the approval on ahead with a messenger to Jern Hornhelm in Thelsamar.  He'll prepare the powder and other supplies to take to Ironband.And one more thing: I want you to personally see that the shipment of powder reaches its destination.  The last one didn't, so keep your mind sharp and your eyes open.308309We need to get this powder to Ironband, but this cart isn't going anywhere now. It'll be a lot for us to carry, and these parts can get dangerous -- and who knows what else the Dark Irons might have in store for us now that Saean is with them.I'll feel a lot better if you helped me watch over things. Miran can offload the powder kegs at camp while you and I protect the cart.311Having inserted a barrel of Marleth's Scalder in the Kharanos Distillery's cellar, you grab a barrel of Thunder Ale as proof of the deed...313The cataclysm drove the troggs to the surface in hordes, forcing the Frostmane trolls to flee for their lives. Unfortunately, they've decided to settle right on our doorstep and make trouble for us.I deployed Mountaineer Dunstan and his squad to the Grizzled Den just southwest of town to keep an eye on the wendigos that live there, but now I need to recall them to Kharanos. Find them and tell them to deploy those remote observation bots the gnomes provided, then return to Kharanos.314We heard the cries in the middle of the night.  Then this morning, sure enough, the herd was missing two rams.  That dastardly beast known as Vagash has been preying on our livelihood.  With Ironforge's troops already spread thin, there is no one to keep Vagash at bay.Perhaps you are brave enough to seek out the beast and slay him.  Bring me one of his fangs and I will reward you.  Vagash lurks just above the ranch here, but be warned, he is deadly.315I'm on a quest to make the perfect stout.  I know I can do it -- brewing's in my blood.  I just need to find the right recipe...The Frostmane trolls grow a plant, shimmerweed, up on Shimmer Ridge to the northwest.  They use it in their strange, tribal rituals. We haven't found much use for it, but it has a unique taste... and I want to experiment with it in my brews!Obtaining the shimmerweed will be dangerous, but I'll pay well for any you can \"borrow\" from the baskets in the troll village.317I'm preparing to start a mission for the Siege Brigade.  It's a long one, and I need to stock Jetsteam with a month's worth of supplies.  So while Steelgrill is working on my tank, can you do some hunting for me?I'll need some fur for bedding, and boar meat for food.  You can get meat from boars and fur from the bears... you can find them both in the snow fields south of the Grizzled Den.318Rejold Barleybrew experiments with his brews.  Some of them taste good, some bad, and some...well, some will lay all but the stoutest dwarf flat.He lives at Brewnall Village, west of Kharanos, and one of his drinks, Evershine, is what I want.  It'll help keep me warm while I'm on the cold road.And...the blessed stuff burns so hot I can throw it in Jetsteam's furnace for a burst of power!  That little tactic has gotten me out of more than one tight spot.319I have a cask of Evershine handy, but...can you do me a favor?  Brewnall village could use a hand against the wild animals that wander the nearby snows.  Sometimes they wander close.We're not afraid of these bears and cats and boars - no self respecting dwarf would be - but if you can take care of those animals for us, then we'd have more time for our crafting and brewing.320Here's your cask of Evershine, .  And again, thank you for the hunting earlier.325Here is the weapon against the fiend of which you spoke.  You're all ready, .  Best of luck to you, and I look forward to your tale of glory!332If you talk to anyone about wine, then you know we Gallinas sell the best wine in Stormwind.  And we're not far, still in the Trade District along the city's lovely canals.Here, take this pamphlet.  Bring it to my sister Suzetta at our shop for a complimentary bottle of the famous Dalaran Noir.  You won't regret it!333We've been doing a lot of business lately.  It seems like everyone is buying armor and sturdy clothes.  Almost like they expect a cold, harsh season ahead...But those are future worries.  My worry today is that I'm running out of knitted clothing to sell.  I need another load from our supplier.If you can take this request to Rema Schneider at the Canal Tailor and Fit Shop, I'd be most grateful.334My son Thurman is an apprentice at the Larson Clothiers, in the Mage's Quarter.  He was in a hurry today and forgot his shears and needles.  I know a great  like you must have important tasks at hand, but without his tools Thurman can't do his apprentice work!Please, .  Can you take my son's sewing kit to him?  Larson Clothiers is one of two clothing shops in the Mage's Quarter - it's the one deeper in, near the Mage's Tower.335Lord Wishock is causing quite a stir amongst the House of Nobles.  He was made aware of our little \"establishment\" down here and is lobbying for a full investigation.  I have a plan to keep Wishock \"preoccupied,\" but I'll need your help. There is a flower growing in the Garden of Stalvan on the outskirts of Darkshire.  This small white flower is known as the Tear of Tilloa.  I will also need a Musquash Root, found only at the very base of the falls far beneath the Stonewrought Dam in the Wetlands.336Lord Wishock, like all men, has his weaknesses.  His happens to be a fondness for liquor.  The hypocrisy is astounding.  The trite fool spends his days trying to shut down our little \"tavern\" while his nights are spent upstairs, running up a bill he never pays.  Well, let's see how Wishock likes this special brew I have prepared for him:  Black Claw stout.  It's got quite a kick, .Take it to him and see how he likes it.  Most likely the old fool is milling about the Hall of Petitioners.351You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.\"The name's Oglethorpe, and my homing robot has gone missing!  I will reward you for its recovery!  Please take this beacon to the robot.  Excellent, I now have computed the coordinates for you!  It crashed near the Gaping Chasm in Tanaris!\"353The Stormpikes are a respected dwarven clan, and are well known for their fine and discerning tastes.  So it's no wonder that Gringer Stormpike, a Mountaineer of Ironforge, commissioned me to craft him a weapon.The weapon is finished, but... Mountaineer Stormpike is far away, in distant Loch Modan.  If you plan on traveling to the north, can you deliver this package to him?My last message from Mountaineer Stormpike said he's stationed at the northern guard tower in Loch Modan.384Nothing my tavern patrons enjoy more than some Beer Basted Boar Ribs!  Only problem is, the local trapper who used to bring me supplies enlisted in the King's Army to help with the war on the Alliance front. Maybe you can help me out?  If you bring me some boar ribs and a Rhapsody Malt from the tavern here, I'll give you the family recipe for my famous Beer Basted Boar Ribs, not to mention a free sample!  The secret's in the Malt!397I hear Lord Wishock enjoyed his beverage.  You have served us well, .  The Warlocks of Stormwind will be able to practice our ways without disturbance, thanks to you.  For your efforts, I have prepared a special gift for you.  Speak with my servant, Zggi, and claim your reward.400Beldin Steelgrill owns the local mechanic shop, and he's the best siege engine tech there is!  But he's not forgiving to his tools.  I swear he almost breaks more arclight spanners than we can supply him with!We just filled his last order for tools.  If you deliver it to him I'm sure he'll make it worth the effort.His shop, Steelgrill's Depot, is just northeast of Kharanos.  And it's a local haunt for veteran siege engine pilots, so keep your ears open for opportunities while you're there.403412I should go back to Gnomeregan and continue researching a cure for irradiated gnomes.But, I stayed behind in Kharanos because the town is my home and I wanted to help defend it from the Frostmane attacks. I've been working on maintaining and repairing the steam tanks.For some reason, Frostmane scavengers have taken a liking to the gyromechanic gears I need to complete the repairs. They're all over the Frostmane Front to the southeast of town. Will you help me get those gears back?432Those Light-blasted troggs, turning my work site into a wreck!

I want to kill them all!This can't be good for my health, all this stress and anger... What have they left me with? Nothing!I'd kill them myself, but my aim's no good anymore! You go into the quarry and kill some of the filthy buggers! I'll pay you! Just hurt them, kill them!433As a member of the Senate and the Explorers' League, I've taken it upon myself to investigate conditions at the quarry. The troggs have run wild!They've made a mess of the Gol'Bolar quarry. As we dug deep into the earth, they poured out, destroying our equipment and trapping many of the miners below ground.We have to get them out of there. I've had mages working overtime to enchant these runes of return. If you can get them to the trapped miners, they can return to the surface in safety.454We'd been hauling the barrels of powder back and forth in trips before this... business. Now we have to split up the work, Miran's taking the barrels and I'm watching over the other ones.I don't feel safe letting Miran haul the rest of the shipment by himself.

His duty as the chosen protector of the Sleeping is to ensure their safety so that their pact with Ysera remains fulfilled.But word from Gaerolas is now delayed and I grow nervous.  Travel east to Starbreeze Village and bring back a report from Gaerolas so that I can put my worries to rest, knowing my dreaming brethren slumber safely.476The Gnarlpine tribe's corruption has returned!They ambushed me as I left for the Ban'ethil Barrow Den and proceeded to pillage Starbreeze Village. Something in the forest has corrupted Ursal the Mauler, their chieftain, and he is using the evil powers of the fel moss to drive them mad.I am too wounded to return to Athridas to bring him this grave news.  The task is left to you, young .

There is not time for me to find enough feathers, and I was wondering, would you gather more for me?You can find feathers of the correct size from the harpies residing far to the north and northwest of Thunder Bluff. I need only 6 azure and 6 bronze feathers to complete the design.749A few days ago, we found a Venture Co. caravan traveling under guard on the northern shore of Stonebull Lake. We'd lost two of our number in an earlier battle, so we were quick to attack and lay waste to the caravan.We left their supply crates, thinking that our torches would destroy anything of value, but given that Venture Co. salvagers have been spotted near the burned wagons, maybe we were wrong.Perhaps you could go to the caravan and examine the contents of the crates.751Prying open the lid reveals a tightly packed assortment of ore and minerals, more evidence of the Venture Co.'s mining operation in Mulgore. On the top of the ore and minerals you remove a tightly bound sheaf of papers.Up in the foothills to the east, you can barely hear the sounds of work, and see smoke rising from a large fire.761The swoop is a cunning bird, and difficult to find and hunt.

Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.765According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me.

There's one thing you need to know in life, and that's if you want something done well, do it yourself.\"I can't deal with losing all our caravans, so I'm just going to take matters into my own hands. Harpies plague our supply routes.

He camps west of these Forgotten Pools.Defeat him, then return to me.851Verog may be hard to find, but judging by the info you gathered, his mate Wyneth is always in his command tent just west of here. If we kill her, Verog will come running.Regthar sent us here to scout, but he also said we should seize any opportunity to upset the centaur chain of command if we can. Lure out Verog and kill him!852Hezrul Bloodmark is the leader of the Kolkar centaurs in the Barrens. He is fierce, brutal and cunning. Defeating him would disrupt and fracture the Kolkars, greatly reducing their threat to us.So kill him.

If we reduce their numbers, the Kolkar will have no might with which to support their rage. And so, I have a bounty task for you.Around the Lushwater Oasis to the south, slay Kolkar Marauders and Stormseers to collect their bracers. Return when you have a heap of these trophies and the Horde will reward you well.858I don't suppose Sputtervalve sent you? I'm in a bind here. I hopped in without realizing that I need a key to unlock the shredder's movement column. One of the other shredder operators asked me if everything was okay, and I panicked!

Just some buttons here, and a lever or two... Well, are you ready to go?865The raptors of the Barrens are smarter than raptors in other lands. I think all those smarts are hiding in their horns! If so, then I could grind their horns into powder and use it to make \"smart drinks.\" I'll make a fortune!Here's where you come in: I want the horn from the smartest raptor around. \"King Reaperclaw\" leads a whole pack of intelligent raptors up on the bluffs north of Ratchet. Bring me his horn! And don't get ripped to ribbons like everyone else I've sent!866The herbs of the Barrens are not quite like herbs in other lands.  Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different.I want to study those differences... to see if they're exploitable!If you are skilled in herbalism, then gather root samples off the herbs you find in the Barrens.  Bring back these samples so that I may compare them with herbs from other regions.867Since you're here, , perhaps you can help me with a small problem. The blasted harpies have been ravaging our caravan supplies for too long. It's time we slit a few of their throats and diminished their numbers.The most devastating attack will destroy a good section of their lower chain of command and then we can work our way to the top.Take out Witchwing harpies of any kind in the Northwest and bring me 6 Witchwing Talons. That should be a good start...869Animal tracks surround the wreckage, tracks made by enormous curved claws. They appear to be raptor tracks.Your first instinct is that raptor-riders assaulted the caravan, but the impressions aren't deep and there are no non-animal tracks to be seen.The tracks head northeast of here toward the east side of Thorn Hill. The answer to this mystery must lie in its shadow.870Have you felt the tremors, ? Something has cleaved this land in two. But we druids can sense other tremors, as well.Life is stirring in lands once dry and lifeless. The oases around the Crossroads are suddenly blooming. I can sense a power leaking its way to the surface, but from where? Is it related to the disaster that shattered the Barrens?We must find the source. Travel to the Forgotten Pools, northwest of the Crossroads. Search its waters for a source of power, then return here.871All the quilboars are our enemies, . Some just prove to be more of a nuisance than others.The Razormane tribe has been attacking our supply caravans that roll through here from Orgrimmar. I have scouts seeking the leader of these raids, but until then, any losses you can inflict on the filthy pig men would aid us.Start just south of here, where they've been raiding our camps near the river. Seek them out, and slay them.872Pigmen running amok right on the border of Durotar? Not on my watch! It is as they say, : The best defense is crushing all who oppose you.One of my scouts followed the quilboar after the last caravan raid, so we know where to strike. Kreenig Snarlsnout is the mastermind behind the attacks along the river. Crush him, . Defeat him and disembowel his forces so that the attacks on this camp cease.Search for a quilboar-infested cavern along the river, just south of our stables.875The only way to stop the harpy raiders is to destroy their chain of command. The harpies are led by fearless lieutenants, Witchwing Slayers. If the Slayers fall, the rest will follow.Go to the Dry Hills and cut down the Witchwing Slayers. Make sure they die painfully, . We want those harpy wenches to know the idiocy of picking fights with the Horde.876The harpies you've killed mentioned their matron, Serena Bloodfeather. Judging from their vile hatred toward the Horde, she must hold some kind of deep-seated grudge. You decide to hunt down Serena Bloodfeather and end matters once and for all.877Can what's happening to the south happen here? Judging by what you found at the Forgotten Pools, these oases may be the key. Let's perform an experiment.Here, take these seeds I've collected from the summit here. They are dead and infertile, but carry them down to the Stagnant Oasis just below us. If there is a fissure there, then place the seeds within it... and observe. Report your findings back to Tonga at the Crossroads.880It will be important to study both plant and animal life impacted by the oases and the unusual energies you've discovered. The Stagnant Oasis below us is home to a species of snapjaw turtles. Recently their population has exploded. Moreover, the once peaceful animals are growing aggressive, as I learned the hard way before trekking up here.I suspect they've been altered by the oases. Collect their shells and take them to Tonga at Crossroads for further study.881Whitemist, or 'Echeyakee' in the tauren tongue, is the king of the savannah cats. He hunts with such stealth, they say he's like a thin, white mist on the earth. He kills so fast his prey have no time for fear or pain.The tauren say he is both mercy and death., I now set you on the path to hunt Echeyakee. His lair is just northwest of here, on the north side of a small mountain, among the bones of giant Kodo.Go. Blow this horn when you reach his lair. Blow the horn, and he will come.887Gazlowe promised me a promotion if I can help him with Ratchet's pirate issues. The problem is these new buccaneers that sailed in and took over Fray Island, south of here. They're not just after our goods - they've got grudges to settle!

Bring me their tusks, and we will celebrate their deaths together.903If you want to really demonstrate your bravery to me, let me send you after something that really bites. The savannah huntresses of the Barrens are as sly as they come. Tough, resourceful, quick... and deadly. They've been hassling our scouts recently around the outskirts of the town, especially to the northeast.Be wary as you hunt them, , or you may find yourself no longer the predator, but instead the prey.905The hunt deepens, . Now you must find and defeat your prey within its lair.Hunt the Sunscale raptors to the south, where they have built a warren amongst the hills just off of the road. Slay them and remove the feathers they wear. Place the feathers on the sunscale raptor nests to show their brethren you do not fear them!Be cautious, . Raptors hunt in packs and will swarm you if you are not cautious.918The timberlings of Teldrassil are elementals of nature.  In some ways they reflect the natural order of plants and animals on our great tree.So it is disturbing to see how angry the timberlings are, particularly considering that things should be healing.I want to help hunt down the source.  I have been working on different methods of nurturing plants and would like to try them on timberling seeds.  Please, can you gather seeds from timberlings around Lake Al'Ameth and bring them to me?919Small timberlings are sprouting around the waters of Lake Al'Ameth.  I'm afraid these sprouts are beyond help -- we should try to clear them from the land before they grow large enough to cause trouble.When you're wandering the lake, if you see any timberling sprouts please take them.  Help keep our land clean!922, can you take one of the seeds you brought me to my friend, Rellian Greenspyre?  He is a druid that resides at Wellspring Hovel, and when last we spoke he revealed his interest in my work with the Timberlings.

I hope that, some day, you will see the fruit of my labors.You will find Wellspring Hovel along the road heading west out of Dolanaar, on the way to Darnassus.923There is a malevolence growing in the timberlings. We are trying to find the source, but until we do...in order to keep Teldrassil safe we must cut down the timberlings who are beyond help. Those that wander Wellspring Lake to the north are the most tainted. They must be removed!Destroy the Timberlings you find there, and gather the mossy tumors growing upon them. Bring the tumors to me so that they may be burned.927The heart of Blackmoss the Fetid is covered with a dark, oily moss.  In fact, the only way to tell this is a heart is from its slow, rhythmic beat... A beat that continues even now.Perhaps Denalan will want to see this heart.929Let me tell you more of the task you must complete. The druids in Darnassus use the water of the moonwells of Teldrassil, and their moonwell must be replenished from time to time. Using these specially crafted phials, you can collect the water of the moonwells.Take this vessel to the moonwell outside of Starbreeze Village to the east, and fill it with some of its waters, then return to me. Pay heed to the lessons of the moonwells, lest we find ourselves furthering our shortcomings.930Hanging from beneath the fronds of this glowing plant is a large, round fruit.Denalan would want to study this fruit, you are certain.931The fronds on this plant shimmer in the forest light, giving it a twisting, pulsing aura.You believe that Denalan would want a specimen of this.932I must warn you, , this matter must stay between us.

His heart is black as night, and he plots something most foul.You must find him within his nearby cave just to the north of here, and bring me his head.933There is one last moonwell that I would like you to visit.  It is directly south of here, on the shores of the Pools of Arlithrien. Be wary as you seek out the well, and keep your weapons close at hand. I sense a growing corruption from the boughs of southern Teldrassil.When you have the water, I want you to bring it to a familiar face that you'll see at the pools. She wishes to battle the corruption, and has asked for you personally.935Our tasks are done here for now. This water proved to be of great importance, but it wasn't originally meant for me. Go ahead and bring it back to Corithras at the crossroads, I'm sure he'd like you to deliver it to its original destination.937I was dispatched with a small group of Sentinels here to protect the Oracle Tree from the harpies that have made nests all around the glade. Little by little we are trying to push them back.When the Oracle Tree attempted to send a runner to Darnassus with a report, the messenger was attacked and killed by a group of the harpies.If you feel up to the task, go to their nests, slay them, and return their belts to me as proof of your deeds.938The sabercat's fur is a distinctive gray color, blending into the surrounding forest. As she lays there, you observe that she is badly wounded, with deep lacerations across her back and stomach.She raises her head and gazes at you, bright intelligence shining in blue eyes.

You see, our Warchief is wise and prudent, and he continues to put his people first. Ultimately, he is a diplomat, and in his time with the humans he learned much of their ways.If the tale I've started piques your interest, then find Keldran near the western exit of the city. His hovel is there.1432As the Alliance progresses deeper and deeper into Kalimdor, incorrect conclusions may be drawn about the Horde making pacts with the Burning Legion. The Warchief cannot allow that to happen. And with his blessing, I am taking control of overseeing them removed.I have agents in the area of Desolace at the Ghost Walker Post north of the great Kodo Graveyard. Head south of the Charred Vale in the Stonetalon Mountains and you shall come across it. When you arrive, seek out Takata Steelblade.1433The Burning Blade have many agendas, but know that they are evil to their core, their spirits corrupted, and their destruction is the only way to thwart their objectives.Keldran sent Maurin with me because of his knowledge of the Blade and their warlock ways.He has control of our plots against the Blade while I deal with the other demonic threats here in Desolace.Speak to him, and he will guide you in his designs.1434A demon infestation does not occur without other influences--something else allows evil to gain a foothold.It may start with a weakened spirit, a needless desire for power; perhaps it's a thirst for revenge, or the appeal for final justice. When we are beset by pain, evil takes advantage of us--evil such as the satyr.Ties have been made between them and the Burning Blade, and Thrall would have them slain. Seek them out to the northeast of here, and return to me when you've driven them back.1436The fight goes well, . Perhaps the Warchief will allow us to return to our homes before the seasons change if we continue to make such great strides in our battle against the demons and their underlings.Return to Keldran and let him know what we have done. I am sure he will reward you for your efforts here. His cause is important to him, and he will take pride in knowing that the Warchief respects his concerns.1442Greetings, . What can I do for one who follows a holy path?Ah, yes, Stilwell, the blacksmith... from long ago. I remember him well, though, I have not heard his name in some time.He never struck me as an impudent man, so I can only assume his desire for a Kor gem is noble.If you truly wish for one of the gems, then you must head to the northwest of Ashenvale. You will find Blackfathom Deeps there within some ancient ruins. The naga who still use the gems are down below. Do not go alone, .1453There's work to be done in Desolace, . It's an atrocious place, befouled by centaur and other nasties. But if you're looking for a good week's honest work, then head there, meet with Kreldig Ungor, and tell him I sentcha.You can find him holed up at Nijel's Point--it's a little cozy camp hidden in the mountains of northern Desolace. Just head east if you enter from the Stonetalon Mountains. It's easy to miss, so be on the lookout.1454Greetings, friend. Have yerself a seat here...My first order of business is for the mage Karnitol--a noble of some sort in Stormwind. Seems his ship was attacked by sea giants while off the coast in the northwest of Desolace. He and his servants tried to bring one of his more valuable chests ashore, but when the sea giants attacked in droves, he chose to abandon it and teleport himself and his servants to safety.He wants us to find the chest and its contents, and return it to him in Stormwind.1455You take a few moments to figure out what pried the chest open, and you notice along the sides and top of the chest, long, deep scratches that reveal that something other than a man or giant took interest in it. The marks don't appear as if they were caused by dagger or sword.After going through the chest you find it to be completely empty.Not having another course of action, you close the chest and prepare to leave. Kreldig will be disappointed.1456Intriguing.Well, we might not be without hope quite yet.Along that same coast, but to the north near Ranazjar Isle, there're night elf ruins at the bottom of the ocean. A tribe of naga, the Slitherblade, make that their home. I think that'd be our best bet.If a scouting party went that far south, then they must've been pretty powerful. If you're gonna find Karnitol's belongings, I'd start with the more powerful naga: the tidehunters or sea witches.1467To get paid, you're gonna have to get back to Ironforge and speak to Roetten himself. He'll love getting Leftwitch's package out of the way anyway. Just give him this and it should be enough to get your booty.And don't worry, I'm still going to put in a good word for you when I get back. I shouldn't be in Desolace much longer.1468You're willing to help us here at the orphanage?  Bless you, friend; your aid during Children's Week will be invaluable.Take this whistle.  You will only be able to use it for a short amount of time - typically not longer than Children's Week itself.  When you use it, you will be able to talk with the child you've agreed to look after.

Watch out for crazy Old God worshipping night elf.8309After our initial foray into the hives and Mistress Mar'alith's subsequent madness the three hives have been spewing out bugs! The increased activity might be tied into the glyphs covering those strange crystals.If I can get rubbings of those crystals and the glyphs on them, we might be able to make sense of this madness.Take this transcription set  and hit Hive'Regal to the east, . That's the last rubbing I need!8310I think I can formulate an elixir that will allow us to more readily decipher the glyphs and language of the silithid and Qiraji! What do I need? Glad you asked! I need brains!Normally I'd need a brain from each silithid type that inhabit the hives. Another brave explorer brought me two of 'em here... and never came back from Hive'Regal.Bring me back a silithid brain from Hive'Regal... and be careful not to end up like him!8311I'm not allowed to go trick-or-treating.  After Deathwing's attack, I'm lucky Matron Nightingale lets me be this far away.If you trick-or-treat for me, I'd trade you the candy you get for some I already have!Each of the innkeepers in the big cities have candy they give for Hallow's End - talk to them and do the tricks they ask for!  Also, a little gnome named Talvash in Ironforge is handing out candy as well.  When you have all the candy, bring them back to me here!8312I want to keep trick-or-treating, but I can't because the Matron won't let me.  If you go for me, I'd trade you the candy you get for some I already have!  I think you'd like this candy - it makes you turn into things both funny and scary!Each of the innkeepers in the big cities have candy they give for Hallow's End - talk to them and do the tricks they ask for!  Also, a troll named Kali Remik in Orgrimmar is handing out candy as well.  When you have all the candy, bring them back to me here!8313While the recipe for cooking sandworm meat is legible, it contains references to herbs and spices you've never heard of.  Calandrath might have enough knowledge of the plants that grow in the desert to make sense of it.8314We're on the verge of a breakthrough, ! The rubbings you recovered have allowed us to recreate the glyphs on this crystalline prism. They are apparently a means for the Qiraji and other unknown entities to communicate various messages to the silithid.Unfortunately, that is all we could get out of the glyphs. We need to find a way to unlock the messages hidden within the crystals.Take the glyphed crystal prism to Geologist Larksbane at Cenarion Hold.  She might be able to help.8317That recipe sure will come in handy.  I'd better get to work so I can have some smoked desert dumplings ready for today.  I could use a hand in making some, I'll make it worth your while.8318Some of the Twilight's Hammer cultists carry around little papers with gibberish written on them.  I want you to bring me a stack of them, .I can't figure out what the gibberish means, but that's not the point!  These papers are how their different groups communicate secretly.  The more texts we take out of circulation, the less they can communicate!83198320The Twilight's Hammer, an insane cult bent on destruction, set up camps in Silithus and perform rituals day and night.  We do not yet know their plans, but we do think they are somehow linked to the pulsing red crystals spread across the desert.Although their mystery may one day be solved, we must first deal with their immediate threat.  Go to their camps to the west and seek out Twilight geolords.  They are the heads of these serpents; that is where we must strike!8321We have discovered another base of operations for the Twilight's Hammer.  It is called Twilight's Run; it is a cave tucked in the northeast corner of Silithus.  The local leader of the cult, Vyral the Vile, haunts that cave - it is he who you must next defeat.  When you have done this, bring me his signet ring.Fortune to you, .  The horrors of Twilight's Run are formidable indeed.8323Now that I have the Twilight Lexicon in my possession, there is a small favor I'd like to ask of you.My former organization has a secret encoded bulletin they circulate on a monthly basis.If they make any progress searching for me or if they call off the search, word will be published on the True Believer.Although this information is obviously valuable to me, the publication contains other useful information that I can share.  Bring me any encoded texts you find on Twilight's Hammer members.83248325The sooner you begin your education, , the better for us all.  There is little room for error, so listen closely.The Burning Crystals - the green floating objects to the west of the Sunspire here - have long been used to power the isle's experimentations.  The mana wyrms were their guardians, but the Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas has driven them errant from our lack of magical control over them.There is little choice but to thin their numbers for reclamation.  Do this, then return to me.8326Your effort has made something clear that, honestly, I wish were not true.  The unchecked power of the Burning Crystals has maligned a much larger swath of the isle's natural balance than I thought.  We must now take on more unfortunate measures to reclaim control.The nearby lynxes have succumbed to the influence of the crystals, and they must be put down.  Bring their collars, , as I may yet be able to fashion a magical restraint to turn some back from being uncontrolled.8327You are to report to my assistant, Lanthan Perilon.  He will instruct you on what needs to be done next.  While we here at the Sunspire will continue to rein in the Burning Crystals, you will be focused on a more pressing matter concerning Falthrien Academy.  Lanthan will explain fully when you speak to him.Simply walk west of here along the path, and you should see him standing close by.Good luck,  - your continued successes shall be rewarded.8328As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young mages here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Julia Sunstriker.  Speak with Julia and see what training she has available for you.

I must maintain my vigil over the Sunwell here, so I'll ask you to collect them in my stead.I need my scrying orb, my scroll of Scourge magic, and my journal.  Use this satchel for some extra space, as my things are rather bulky.  Return them to me and I'll give you a little something - you know, for the effort; you can keep the satchel as well!8334Before sending you to the Academy, I want you on another task that needs to be dealt with immediately.  Once used to aid us in the gardening of Sunstrider Isle, the bestial tenders now have grown out of our control.  Clear them out with due haste, but be warned - their lack of control has made them aggressive.  It is such aggression that forces us to put down these once-gentle servants.It doesn't please me to ask you to do such a task, but survival is survival.  I'll mourn later.8335A betrayer of our people resides atop Falthrien Academy to the southwest.Felendren is his name, and he was banished from blood elf lands for failing to heed the warnings of our teachers and elders.  He is the worst of our society, as he lives only to feed his insatiable magical addictions.  He refused to learn control; he is a shell of his former self - one of the Wretched - and he is a threat to the Sunspire.Destroy him and the wraiths he uses as minions.8336It's a shame that we've lost control of many of the creatures here on the island.  This was once a tranquil place of study and research.  Now it's all we can do to keep from being attacked by our own creations!I'm going to offer you a chance to receive a magical boon in exchange for some collecting work on your part.  Bring me a stack of arcane slivers that are found on the mana-using creatures of Sunstrider Isle, and I will cast a spell on you that should aid your adventures on the isle.8338You've found an odd sliver of crystallized mana on the corpse of the tainted arcane wraith.  The sliver is different than others you may have seen in that it is as dark and sinister-looking as the wraith you looted it from.  Just holding it gives you a sense of unnatural foreboding.Arcanist Helion at the gazebo of the Sunspire on Sunstrider Isle just might be someone who would have a use for the sliver.8345Day after day I stand here, watching, waiting.  I've been accused of dwelling too much on our past, while my eyes look to the horizon.  But it is my firm belief that each visitor to this island should honor those who have sacrificed all so that they may continue to do so.Dath'Remar Sunstrider was our first king.  He led us here from Kalimdor through the Maelstrom.Seek out his shrine to the west and do not return to me until you have read the plaque upon it in his honor.8346If there is only one lesson you deign to remember from your time on Sunstrider Isle, let it be this - control your thirst for magic.  It is a thirst unending,  - what you absorb must be controlled and released via Arcane Torrent.  Failure is to become one of the Wretched... hopelessly addicted and insane.Seek out a mana wyrm and unleash your Arcane Torrent upon it.  Learn to master your power. When you have sufficiently released an Arcane Torrent, return to me.8347Magistrix Erona wanted you to head over to Silvermoon City in order to aid our reclamation efforts there... that is, once you had successfully addressed the situation at Falthrien Academy.  You did not disappoint us, .On your way to Falconwing Square, south of here, you should speak with Outrunner Alarion.  She's not far from the bridge.The Outrunners take care of shuttling goods between here and the mainland, and since you've proven to be so resourceful, they could use your assistance.8350The death of another outrunner is a true tragedy, but it's a risk we all accept when we take the job.  Magistrix Erona at the Sunspire needs to get this package to the inn at Falconwing Square, and she needs it there as soon as possible.We're short handed and I don't have anyone else available that can cover for us.I'm not going to lie to you; the path to Falconwing Square can be extremely dangerous if you leave the safety of Dawning Lane.

Only the essence of the fallen demon will begin the lengthy healing process of the Winterfall tribe... and the salvation of Timbermaw Hold.8482The documents contain detailed maps of different strategic buildings in Eversong Woods.  A diagram of an arcane sanctum is also sketched in good detail.

This is a very delicate situation; even though we've identified the spy, we cannot kill him out in the open.  We cannot try to capture him either as the risk of him escaping is too great.I want you to go find Prospector Anvilward at the North Sanctum and kill him.

The soil is tainted, undead are drawn to it and the energy in the ley lines is completely disrupted.What I want to know, , is whether this taint is reversible or not.

That's right, our beach... our Tranquil Shore, has been infested with the malignancy known as the murloc.This blight will not stand!I have a task for you.  If you feel that you're up to it, I would have their heads!  Let us see if we can put a dent in their numbers so large that, if they have any sense at all, they will return to the murky depths from which they sprang!8885The Grimscale murlocs have not been scared off by your efforts. But, I think I know what will send them packing, as well as get me some personal retribution.They have a murloc chieftain that calls itself Mmmrrrggglll. It wanders the Golden Strand south of the river inlet. The beast once slew a compatriot of mine, and now wears his ring in open defiance and mockery.Slay Mmmrrrggglll, and bring back my friend's ring. Then we shall see these monsters cowed!8886Thank goodness for you, ! Those slimy Grimscale murlocs have pirated away my cargo! It's bad enough that the Wretched have stolen what little magical goods I had, but the murlocs took the rest! What has this land come to?Could you retrieve my cargo? I can't expect that you'd be able to get all of it back, but I'll be grateful for any of it at this point. It was the Grimscale murlocs in the huts, just to the west and south of the anchorage on the Golden Strand, I'm sure of it!8887Interesting... what you have found here is a water-proofed, leather tube containing a number of sheets of parchment. By the markings upon them, the pages are clearly navigation rutters, and each bears the signature of one Captain Kelisendra.You've heard of a small, defended camp just east of the nearby Sunsail Anchorage. Maybe the captain is there?8888, hear my request. For reasons that I cannot go into now, I decided to shut down my nearby school. A few days ago, I sent one of my pupils, Apprentice Loralthalis, there with this very task. I have not heard back from her since.Will you go to Duskwither Spire and check in on her, to make sure that she is well? You'll find it by heading north on the path out of Farstrider Retreat, then go to the right when the road branches.8889As you may know, Magister Duskwither sent me back here to shut down the power sources that feed the Spire. There are three of them, each located in a different place inside.Unfortunately, I appear to be too late, and Duskwither Spire has been overrun with strange, magical creatures. While I haven't the expertise to accomplish this task, surely a , such as yourself, could do so easily?8890, I have one last favor to ask of you. Would you please relay what's transpired here to Magister Duskwither, back at the Farstrider Retreat? Let him know that I am well, but make certain that he is aware that some of the apprentices have become Wretched.Thank you for your help!8891You have discovered what appears to be an investigative journal left behind by Magister Duskwither. A brief scan of its contents reveal some shocking attempts at filtering corrupted magical flows, which might explain what has happened here at Duskwither Spire. The magister is sure to want this brought back to him.8892Sunsail Anchorage has been overrun by Wretched scum.  As soon as we manage to get reinforcements to the area we'll show those thugs who's boss, .In the meantime you can help by showing them a bit of discipline.  Go in there and show them we are not to be trifled with.  You will find Sunsail Anchorage just to the west of Fairbreeze Village.8894It's horrible, I tell you! Strange things happening in the spire, the magister and his apprentices run off, and then the next thing that you know, the whole grounds are overrun with these magical beasties! And who told Wyllithen? No one, that's who!, you've got to help me clear some of these things out... I cannot maintain the grounds while these 'anomalies' are running amok!8895I'm pleased to discover that you're at least somewhat competent, .  I'll give you another task since you seem so eager to prove yourself.This is a letter to Ley-Keeper Caidanis, the arcanist in charge of the upkeep of the North Sanctum.  Go southwest of Falconwing Square  and you will find him.  He is a very important person, so I hope you don't bother him too much with trivial chatter.9035You, there!  You must help me, please!A fellow apprentice and I were attacked by the Wretched!  In their mad hunger for magic, they took everything they could get their hands on: mana crystals, wands, spellbooks... everything!Meledor gave chase after them; I had to stay behind and look after what they didn't take.  Continue down the road and see if you can lend him a hand.9062Those blasted Wretched sure can run fast at the sight of someone who'll stand up to them.  But let's not worry about that now.  I need to find my instructor's elemental grimoire.I'm certain I saw one of those cowards throw it into the river but I cannot seem to be able to locate it.  I could use another set of eyes.  I'll throw in a bit of coin if you spot it.9064Antheol is going to fly off his rocker when he finds out his book is ruined.  I've got a little proposal for you; don't worry, I'll make it worth your while.Take this book to him and tell him nothing of this incident.  If he asks, just tell him you dropped the book into a puddle.  He has no direct authority over you, so there's not much he can do.Antheol delivers his lectures at Stillwhisper Pond, southeast of Silvermoon.  You'll do this for us, right?  I'll reward you handsomely for this favor!9066I hope you learn a valuable lesson today, .  Never trust someone else to lie for you.Now I want you to go back to my two dimwitted students and discipline them using this wand.  My magic tells me that you'll find them along the road to the west on the other side of the Dead Scar.Come back to me after you've done this.  I'll give you a small reward for your troubles.9067I like to throw parties... just a little something to celebrate the magnificence that is Quel'Thalas!But, I'm in a bit of a bind.  I need you to gather up more party supplies.From Vinemaster Suntouched at the Silvermoon City inn, bring me a bottle of Suntouched Special Reserve.  From Zalene Firstlight at Farstrider Retreat acquire more of those delicious Springpaw Appetizers.  And you can pick up my delivery of fireworks from Halis Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village.Be quick about it!9076The Wretched are so oblivious, gorging on foul magic, that they haven't realized we've recovered most of our weapons.  We can't expect them to remain in their stupor, though.  Now is the time for a decisive attack.  Let us make an example of their leader, Aldaron.  He was spotted on the top floor of the building by the anchorage.  Bring me his head; I'll reward you suitably.9119Since you're here, , I've a favor to ask you.  Ley-Keeper Velania's apprentice dropped by earlier to ask for assistance.  Apparently there's some malfunction happening at the West Sanctum.  I've been a bit busy entertaining our... most pleasant... dwarven guest.  See if you can give her a hand.  You'll find the West Sanctum southwest of here.9130Welcome volunteer!  We're running low on supplies here, but Silvermoon has promised us materiel assistance.  That's where you come in.Take this list over to Skymaster Brightdawn. He'll have further instructions for you on how best to get up to Silvermoon City.9133, for a very modest amount of coin, I can send you swiftly flying through the air on one of these magnificent beasts.  And, it's safer than walking there, I can assure you!When you arrive in Silvermoon City, seek out Sathren Azuredawn in the Bazaar.Speak with me once more when you've decided you're ready to brave the skies.9134It doesn't look as if you have a cart or a beast of burden with you, so I'd better send you back only with what you can carry.  If you've spoken with Skymaster Brightdawn at Fairbreeze Village, then you should get this to Sathiel as soon as possible by flying back.Take these goods for final inspection to Skymistress Gloaming just outside Silvermoon City's Shepherd's Gate.9135It all checks out as far as I can tell.So, the question is, have you already spoken to Skymaster Brightdawn in Fairbreeze Village?  If so, then this can be as simple as you paying the small fare and quickly flying back.Let me know when you're ready.9138We're surrounded here, .  The outlying villages have all been overrun by the Scourge!You must head northeast to Suncrown Village immediately and deal with the Nerubian Scourge menace.  You can't miss them - they're spider-like creatures.There's no time to waste.... Quel'Thalas must be reclaimed!9139We've had one success, but there are two more villages that must be reclaimed!Goldenmist Village is our next target. It lies to the northwest, and has been taken by the ghosts of the high elves that used to live there. Gruesome, I know, but these are apparently the sorts of tactics that the Scourge like to employ.Go and defeat these ghosts and wraiths, . Take the west road out of Tranquillien to get there.9140, the final battle against the Ghostlands villages is upon you. Windrunner Village to the southwest has been overrun by a large force of the more powerful Scourge shocktroopers; shades and gargoyles. You will be the spearpoint of our offensive by thinning out their numbers.The magisters at the nearby Sanctum of the Sun have made a special request this time; they want the remains from these Scourge to study in hopes of finding creative ways of fighting them.Good hunting!9143The lieutenant here rushed us into battle with the trolls across the lake instead of scouting the situation first. We were decimated by his stupidity! You hear me Tomathren? You're an idiot!Will you help us, ? Those trolls still need to be dealt with. I need to stay here and nursemaid him -- I think he's lost his mind.Just head east to the other side of the lake into Zeb'Sora. I want revenge... bring me their ears so that I can fashion a nice necklace!9144My nephew was sent into the Ghostlands a few days ago.  He never mentioned anything about his task, except that it was of an extremely secret nature.He never returned and I fear for the worst, .  A missing messenger might not mean much to the callous magisters of Silvermoon, but he's like a son to me.  Please, , will you look for him?9145, I can't just sit here waiting for an audience with the high executor or Dame Auriferous! This cannot wait!We were dealing with the Shadowpine trolls of Zeb'Sora to the northeast across Lake Elrendar. But the lieutenant mishandled the attack and we lost a lot of Farstriders. Then he just fell to pieces afterward.  Ranger Valanna sent me here, and Ranger Salissa to the Farstrider Enclave for help.Please find them, . Valanna was badly injured and the lieutenant's useless.9146I need one last favor of you, .  Just in case Ranger Salissa didn't make it back to Farstrider Enclave on the south edge of the lake, I need you to go there and get help.Just check in with Captain Helios and let him know what's happened here.  I'm sure he'll send help back as soon as he can.9147What are you standing around for?  Can't you see this boy needs immediate attention?  By the looks of it, the plague is beginning to take over his body.  Within minutes not even a master apothecary like me will be able to save him.The animals south of the river all carry the plague in their blood.  Go across the bridge and hunt the plagued beasts there.  Bring me enough plagued blood samples and I'll distill a serum capable of saving this blood elf.  Hurry!9148I... I'm too weak to continue.  I carry a dire warning from Regent Lord Theron, in the form of a letter.  You'll have to deliver it for me.Take it to Arcanist Vandril in Tranquillien.  You'll find the town further to the south along this road.  Go there and... find Vandril...9149To find a cure for the plague we need to understand how it affects different creatures, from the most complex life forms to the lowliest subspecies.I've come here to study the murlocs since, like us, they've retained free will in undeath.  What makes these lowly mongrels so special?  I need to find out, !Travel northwest and bring me their spines so that I may study the accumulation of plague in their marrow.  Who knows what secrets their little bones hold?9150Can you believe it?  We have an actual functioning arcane sanctum up and running southeast of here: the Sanctum of the Sun.  All manner of important magisters have come to take part in running it.Of course they've all forgotten about the Sanctum of the Moon.  Not much remains of it and its energies have given rise to bizarre creatures.I'm not one to let good resources go to waste, however.  Go to the Sanctum of the Moon and see if you can recover the crystallized essences from the creatures there.9151You've proven your loyalty to Tranquillien and have helped us defend it against the threat of the Scourge.  Some of our most powerful magisters have come from Silvermoon to help us take the fight to the enemy's doorstep.They've rebuilt the arcane sanctum to the south and have driven the Scourge away from the surrounding area.  They plan to launch an offensive into Deatholme, Dar'Khan's stronghold.  You would do well to join them, .  I'm sure they can make use of a seasoned  like yourself.9152How am I supposed to supply the war effort when I cannot even safely get my supplies here? I was promised an escort that never came. And then, I had to leave one of my carts behind to the west when I was attacked by a band of ghouls!Want to help out, and get me open for business in the process? Go down the western road out of town and past the graveyard. On the other side of the Dead Scar is a fork in the road. The hill that my cart had to be left on lies just beyond.9155If you've made it this far then you probably know about the Dead Scar and how to this day mindless Scourge follow the path of destruction that Arthas created on his way to Silvermoon City.Make yourself useful and thin down the Scourge's numbers in the Scar.  If you prove to be worth your salt I'll put in a good word for you.9156A bounty is hereby declared for the abominations known as Knucklerot and Luzran.  These dreadful creations of Dar'Khan are extremely dangerous and have been sighted patrolling near the Howling and Bleeding Ziggurats.  Individuals seeking to claim the reward must present the abominations' heads to Deathstalker Rathiel as proof of the deed.9157Every year we, the denizens of Suncrown Village, would take part in a ritual to keep the different aspects of nature under our control.  Dominion over the element of water was symbolized by the summoning and enslavement of an elemental named Aquantion.  Through a wicked perversion of our magic, the scoundrel broke his bonds and enslaved us instead!We wore medallions shaped like waves during the ritual.  Seek them at the bottom of the lake; we'll need them to free my compatriots' spirits!9158You show courage coming to the Ghostlands, .  There is much work to be done here and not enough brave souls to do it.I've a thankless task to offer you, should you have the inclination to aid our cause.  The very wildlife in this land has been tainted by the plague and we must stop it from spreading.  Hunt the ghostclaw lynxes to the east and south of here and return when you've slain enough of them.9159You've proven your worth as an ally, .  I need you to continue your task and track down more plagued wildlife.  This time seek out some of the more dangerous beasts.  Hunt the spindleweb lurkers west of the Dead Scar and the vampiric mistbats just south of here.  Return to me when you're done.9160, we are having difficulty with a group of night elves that have recently taken over a nearby island. They've set up a small camp at the old high elf ley-line nexus, An'daroth, to the northwest. There is a dirt path that leads up to it just past the Dead Scar.I suggest that you lend us your aid by going there, investigating what they are up to, and slaying as many of the conceited night elves as you can.9161Dar'Khan Drathir is believed to have returned from the dead to rule over the armies of the Scourge in the Ghostlands.  Dar'Khan aligned himself with the Scourge long ago... yet he was once a living, breathing elf.  Much of his time was spent inside Dawnstar Spire, northeast of here.  He hid there for many nights, scheming against his own. Search the tower for more information, .  Perhaps he had a journal or kept notes.  One never knows where useful information might present itself.9162As you skim through the pages in the journal you're overcome by an unnerving sense of being watched.The contents are unsettling.  Dar'Khan's soul was one filled with hatred and contempt for his own people.  The extent of his machinations and plots are all documented in great detail.Perhaps there is something here that Vynna will find useful.9163Now, the more direct course of action that we are going to take, to figure out what these night elves are really up to, is to have you go to their island and steal any information that you can come by.I want you to head west down the road out of town to Shalandis Isle, just off the coast. Go there and recover any plans they might have on the island or on their ship.9164Ah, yes.  One of my finest creations.  This draught will break most forms of alchemically induced stupor.Side effects include confusion, nausea and - in rare cases - temporary blindness.  All much preferable to whatever the Scourge plans to do to those prisoners in Deatholme, if you ask me.Best of luck, brave .  You are going to need it.9166You must deliver the recovered night elf plans to An'telas for me. It is to the east, on the southern slopes of Sungraze Peak, just to the northeast of the Sanctum of the Sun.Magister Sylastor is there conducting ongoing studies into the ley-line nexus energy for potential use in our fight against the Scourge. Have him look at these plans to shed some light on what it is that these night elves are up to.9167Everything we've done in the Ghostlands has been done with the goal of taking back what is rightfully ours.  The Scourge have maintained their chokehold on the region for far too long.The time has come for payback, .  Thanks to your help and the help of our new allies, the Forsaken, vengeance will soon be ours.He who sought to steal the power of the Sunwell must die.  Go to Deatholme, the Scourge stronghold south of the Dead Scar.  Bring me Dar'Khan's head and your deeds will go down in history!9169Their moon crystals are scrying devices -- they're going to spy on us! I know that An'daroth can't provide enough power for that, but An'owyn, directly to the south, most definitely can!From the plans I now have a basic knowledge of how these moon crystals work; enough to shut them down. They're keyed so that they can be turned off. You must go to An'owyn, retrieve the controlling orb from one of the night elves and then use it on the moon crystal to stop them from enacting their plan!Hurry, !9170The odious traitor, Dar'Khan, has risen to great power among the ranks of the Scourge.  His lieutenants command vast armies of undead against our dwindling numbers.Masophet the Black, Jurion the Deceiver, Borgoth the Bloodletter, Mirdoran the Fallen.  Learn these names well for in the Ghostlands these Scourge leaders are second only to Dar'Khan himself.  Slay them and their mindless armies will be thrown into disarray.9171This is intolerable!  I have nothing to work with here! Milady asks me to come from Silvermoon City; she deserves cuisine as befits her station.  No?  But I get here and there is no food.  You must go out, , and bring back fresh kills so that I have something to prepare.Dame Auriferous prefers a crunchy texture to her food.  There are plenty of spindleweb lurkers to the southwest on the other side of the Dead Scar.  Disgusting, I know, but that's what we have to work with.9172The magisters at the Sanctum of the Sun have made great progress in analyzing the Scourge's weaknesses with the aid of the Forsaken.  Magister Kaendris will know what to do with this information.You'll find the Sanctum of the Sun southwest of here.  You must hurry, .  Dar'Khan is a cunning enemy and watches our every move!9173, I want you to reclaim Windrunner Spire!It's an honor, really. Windrunner Spire is the original home of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner, queen of the Forsaken and former ranger-general of the elves. But now it's been overrun by the mindless Scourge.To get there take the road south until it branches. Take the right fork and after crossing the Dead Scar continue southwest. You can't miss it.9174That willful elemental ended many lives that fateful day when he revolted against us.  By calling to the lowly murloc to sabotage our rites he subverted our magic and turned it against us.Show him our thirst for vengeance has not waned!  Take these medallions and lay them at the Altar of Tidal Mastery at the bottom of the lake.  Aquantion shall immediately answer your summons!Beware, !  Without our magic controlling him, his wrath will be unrestrained.  Destroy Aquantion so we may rest!9175The necklace shimmers, a remarkable piece of jewelry that doesn't seem to succumb to the gloom that permeates the Ghostlands. Given the inscription, and where you found it, it must be the lost property of Lady Sylvanas Windrunner herself!Perhaps it would be best to first take it to High Executor Mavren at Tranquillien? He seems to be the highest ranking Forsaken in the area and is sure to know what to do with it.9176According to this journal, Dar'Khan promised the Scourge two powerful elven artifacts: the stone of light and the stone of flame.  These were imbued with the magical energies of the Sunwell and attuned to have warding powers against the Scourge.The crystals were to be transported to where the Howling Ziggurat and the Bleeding Ziggurat now stand, in the middle of the Dead Scar.  If they're still held there, we need to recover them.  Their power will be greatly useful in our struggle against the enemy.9180This is quite extraordinary! It appears to be a gift to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner from her sister, Alleria!You must take it to her in the Undercity at once! The lady holds court in the Royal Quarter.To get there, use the orb of translocation in the Inner Sanctum of Sunfury Spire in Silvermoon City to cross over to the Undercity.  Once there, take the elevator ride down into the city proper. Use your maps if you need help finding the Royal Quarter.9192The Underlight Mines to the southwest have been overrun by a clan of gnolls calling themselves the Blackpaw. I don't need to remind you how important those mines are to us as a strategic asset in our ongoing campaign here in the Ghostlands!Take the south road out of town and follow the fork to the right. Just past the ziggurat on the right there will be a short dirt path to the west. Follow it.The ore must flow!9193, our sources tell us that the trolls buried in the Amani Catacombs inside Sungraze Peak have been rising from the dead. Dame Auriferous would have you investigate these catacombs and put to the torch any of the unanimated remains you come across so as to prevent any more of these creatures from rising.The fastest way there is to head north out of town and then take the first fork to the right. This will put you on the north side of the peak, so look to the south for the entrance.9199The corpses of trolls buried inside the Amani Catacombs have been rising from the dead! I want you to go there and bring back proof of their final demise. Some of these mummy trolls, and their living counterparts, carry juju; glowing objects that house an unknown power source.  It's probably what is animating them!The catacombs lie within Sungraze Peak, directly to the east. I am told that the easiest way in lies on the north face of the mountain. See to it, !9207I was sent here from the Sanctum of the Sun to collect some ore samples, but the gnolls have overrun the place! It's going to be my head on a platter if I don't get those samples to the magister soon. Maybe you could help, ?You can find the ore in the tin and copper veins here, and the gnolls are carrying it around, too. When you have enough, take it to Magister Quallestis at the Sanctum of the Sun directly to the east. Go across the Dead Scar and you'll find the sanctum just south of Sungraze Peak.9212These trolls ambushed me and have been keeping me in this cage.  I think they're planning to sacrifice me!  Help me get out of here!The lock on the cage isn't that complex... I just can't get to it from this side.  Please escort me back to the Farstrider Enclave.  I'm sure Captain Helios will reward you, and you'll have my undying gratitude!9214, I want you to kill as many Shadowpine trolls as you can. We need their numbers greatly reduced before we can shift our attention toward Deatholme. And while you're at it, we might as well kill two birds with one stone, so bring me back a load of their weapons. Better that they not go to waste, and we can use them in the fight against the Scourge.Hit their camps hard to the east and the south at Zeb'Tela and Zeb'Nowa.9215WANTED: Bring the head of Kel'gash the Wicked, chieftain of the Shadowpine trolls, to Captain Helios. No questions asked. Kel'gash is known to dwell somewhere to the south in Zeb'Nowa.REWARD: Yes, but no advances!9216I hear the Amani trolls eat their enemies' hearts to steal their strength.  They might just be on to something, .  With the proper treatment, the hearts of the unliving can produce potent elixirs.Hunt down the zombies that roam the Dead Scar and bring me their hearts.  I'll show you the kind of enhancement we can perform to your physical prowess against the undead.92179218The dark energy that flows through the bodies of reanimated skeletons tends to accumulate primarily in their spine.  I've discovered a method of instilling this energy into a potion that boosts our magical abilities against the undead.Bring me some spinal dust and I'll be glad to provide you with a sample.  You'll find an ample number of skeletons wandering the Dead Scar, west of here.92199220If you seek to aid our cause there is no better place to start than here and no better time to do it than now.By rebuilding the Sanctum of the Sun we've raised a banner of defiance in front of our enemy's seat of power: Deatholme.Go forth and fight the hordes of undead that inhabit the vile Scourge fortress.9250With the frame formed, Atiesh is nearly whole. Only the head and base of the staff are now missing. There is also a minor issue regarding the staff being a conduit for Sargeras's evil.Find someone that can assist you in locating the remaining pieces and exorcising the evil from the staff.9251You question why you are still alive. After all, you have in your possession an item of great evil. The answer is not clear, . I only do as I must.Kel'Thuzad sits atop his throne in Naxxramas, plotting... He seeks that which you hold and holds that which you seek.As for the base of the staff; the dwarf, Brann Bronzebeard, held it when he entered Ahn'Qiraj. He has left Ahn'Qiraj but the base of Atiesh remains.Should you succeed in recovering the pieces, return them to me.9252We've experienced a marked increase in Scourge attacks, .  Our defenses are barely holding and there's no sign of reinforcements from Silvermoon City.  Lend us a hand in defending the village by thinning the numbers of the undead roaming the Dead Scar nearby.9253This increase in Scourge attacks leads me to believe there might be a malfunction at one of the protective runestones at the border with the Ghostlands.We used these ancient stones to protect us against the undead.  Most of them were destroyed or lost after the attack on the Sunwell. Follow the road south, towards the Ghostlands, and look to the west for a small path.  You will find Runewarden Deryan by the runestone nearby; he will know whether anything's wrong.9254Thank you for your help, .  While I get things back in order here, I'd like to ask you for a favor.  One of my former apprentices embarked in a very dangerous line of research.  She journeyed to the East Sanctum, in the middle of the Dead Scar.I worry for her well-being.  See if you can find her and convince her to return to her senses.9255As discouraging as my research results are, they still contain valuable data.  I must have a magister review my work before it is taken seriously.  Please, take these notes to Magistrix Landra Dawnstrider at Fairbreeze Village, west of here.9256I have another task for you, .  Ranger Degolien was sent to Fairbreeze Village to find out more about a Wretched attack on a nearby shipyard.  He has requested reinforcements which we cannot yet provide.  Seek him out and grant him whatever aid you can.Fairbreeze Village can be reached by following the road out of Falconwing Square all the way towards the south.  Good luck, .9257This final task will be the most difficult of all, . You have faced and defeated both an Old God and the Lich King's General, but now you must face the hand of Sargeras.Take the staff to Stratholme. It is there that you will find a piece of consecrated earth: ground where the greatest knights of Lordaeron were murdered. Place the befouled staff upon the holy ground and prepare for an entity of immense power to break from within... Defeat the demonic being that controls the staff and return to me.9258A foul taint in the soil precedes the expansion of the Scourge into a new area.  The protective runestones along the border with the Ghostlands have warded the land against this taint in the past.The westernmost runestone was destroyed during a Scourge attack, which forced us to burn the ground around it to prevent the taint from spreading.My sister, Larianna Riverwind, watches over the Scorched Grove.  Go find her; she might have some work for you.92599266926792689269This final task will be the most difficult of all, .

The poor souls were victims of a tragic incident in which scores of them drowned at the bottom of the lake.The details of the event are mostly forgotten, but their haunting cries serve as a constant reminder of their curse.If you're up to the task, I want you to go to the lake and put an end to their suffering, .  You will have my gratitude as well as theirs... I'm sure.9275I'm on loan to the Farstriders in an attempt to help with their troll difficulties. I believe that I have a solution to their problem.At my disposal are a number of potent poisons. The trolls, as you know, are living creatures and therefore must eat. If we combine my poison with their food... well, I'm sure that the results will be entertaining!Care to help rid us of the Shadowpine trolls at Zeb'Nowa to the south? The camp straddles both the north and south sides of the road to Zul'Aman.9276Our resources are spread pretty thin here, , so your help is going to be invaluable.  The captain has tasked me with overseeing the harassment of the local Shadowpine troll camps. We have a policy of keeping them off balance until the day when we can launch a brutal offensive to wipe them out.Until then, we need all of the volunteers that we can get so that those Shadowpine troll numbers are decreased.Think you could head east to Zeb'Tela and hurt them a little?9277Time for something a little more challenging. Zeb'Nowa, to the south, is where the more powerful Shadowpine trolls make their home. In our continuing effort to keep the troll numbers to a minimum I'm dispatching you to go down there and assail them by whatever means you have at your disposal.What do you say, ? Ready to deal with some more trolls?9279Nevermind my injuries, . It's a miracle that any of us are alive!It didn't look like you'd pull through; you've been in suspension for weeks.Something happened and the Exodar crashed. Many have died.But I'm relieved that you are alive, . With you leading our efforts, I'm sure we'll get to safety soon! Proenitus asked me to send you to him when you awoke. He's waiting for you at the bottom of the hill. Just follow the path southwest.9280Our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly!Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute.The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but they are mostly concentrated in the northwest.9281Magister Kaendris sent me down here to clear the area of any hostile wildlife.  Once this area is secured, the magisters plan to turn it into some sort of advance outpost against the Scourge.Now if there's one thing I've learned as an apprentice it's to delegate responsibility - especially in matters that endanger one's life!If you're interested, I'll pay you well to kill the greater spindlewebs and ghostclaw ravagers to the west and south of here.9282Magisters and Farstriders may not see eye to eye all the time, .  When it comes to Dar'Khan, however, we're all in agreement that a way must be found to defeat him and his legions.Ranger Vynna, at the Farstrider Enclave northeast of here, has come across important information regarding our enemy.  Speak to her and see if you can be of assistance.9283The healing crystals are replenished, but that is not the only way we can help the injured. All draenei can tap the gift of the Naaru to heal. You must use this ability to heal one of the crash survivors.You'll find most of the survivors in the areas to the west and northwest, but the crash scattered us all over the vale.The survivors have suffered from exposure to the irradiated power crystals, so you should be able to find them by the red glow that surround them.You must save them, .928792889289929092919293The nearby lake has been contaminated by one of the ship's power crystals.  Many of the plants and animals of Ammen Vale have been mutated because of this.I have a theory on how to heal the lake, but I must have samples from the mutated lashers for analysis.  They can be found to the west in the Ammen Fields.Will you help me, ?9294Thank goodness, I think it'll work!  I have an agent for you to spread at Silverline Lake to the south.  It will neutralize the effects of the irradiated ship's power crystal that fell there.Swim out and scatter the neutralizing agent near it.  Don't worry, you won't be exposed long enough to become irradiated.9303Zhanaa needs our help to salvage parts from the Exodar.  Taerix prepared an inoculum that can be given to the Nestlewood owlkin that live in the area of a lot of the salvage.Just get close to the unaffected ones and use the crystal on them.  Unfortunately, you'll have to kill the others.  You'll find the owlkin at Nestlewood Thicket and Nestlewood Hills to the southeast.9305We managed to recover a damaged holographic emitter from the crash. If we repair it, we'll have a chance to find other survivors outside of Ammen Vale.There were devices from the ship that could be salvaged for spare parts in the area, but the local owlkin carried them off before we could get to them. , you must go south to Nestlewood Thicket and Hills to find the spare parts.9309We now have several separate confirmations of unusual activity up on the Shadow Ridge.This is disturbing; we thought that the scouting missions already undertaken had been thorough. One of my scouts hasn't reported back yet., I need you to head southwest to the other side of Silverline Lake and find Tolaan, and see what has delayed him.9311I have a plan. We must kill their leader. Without their master, perhaps they will retreat to regroup. We just need to buy time until the repairs are completed.Then Vindicator Aldar must know of this. Kill the surveyor, then return and tell him what we've found.9312, while you were out investigating the Shadow Ridge, Zhanaa here has been going on about the holographic emitter.  You might want to speak with her.9313By all that is good, , you must go at once to this Azure Watch and speak with Dyvuun!There is a path that leads west off of this tiny isle.  Follow it and cross the Crystalbrook River to arrive on the larger part of the isle.  Continue to follow the path and you should find Azure Watch.See if you can convince them to send us some aid and supplies.  The rest of us will follow when we can.Thank you, we wouldn't have made it without you!9314! A couple mutated beasts jumped me and my leg is injured.I was sent on a scouting mission from Azure Watch after we received word from Zhanaa. Please, could you go speak with Caregiver Chellan in my stead? She needs to know how many people to expect in Azure Watch. Just cross the Crystalbrook River here and continue following the road until you get to Azure Watch.Be sure to ask her for a place for yourself to stay in.9315Come closer, I am ... dying.I was sent here ... to slay these Nerubians, but Vandril didn't ... know that they have a leader.You must find and ... slay Anok'suten.

With the influx of sin'dorei pilgrims from Azeroth, we must establish a route that's safe from our enemies' prying eyes.I've given it some thought and have arrived at a solution.  We're to establish a secret path through the Great Fissure.Yes, even though the area is crawling with brutal rock flayers, they are merely beasts and can be taught to fear us.  I want you to go and kill a good number of them.  They shall learn fear.9345Just as Zeth'Gor came into view, a Legion patrol caught sight of me. I ran, hoping to duck into one of the towers in the distance, but one of their felhounds caught up with me and nearly hamstrung me!I managed to escape, but my leg is in terrible shape. Stone Guard Ambelan found me and brought me here.Now, I have to find a way to tend to my leg. Spineleaf grows in and around the Valley of Bones to the north . A salve made from it will dull the pain enough for me to travel.9349I'm starving!There's irony in that, wouldn't you say?  A starving cook?According to this tourist map we were following - before we were so rudely shot down - there's an area to the southwest, near Terokkar Forest.  It's called the Razorthorn Trail, and supposedly it's brimming with delicious ravager eggs!I could cook up quite a feast if only someone were brave enough to go down there and get me some!9351Even if I can get the zeppelin's frame repaired, I'll have to find something else to power the engine. I'm all out of fuel and there's no place to fill up around here!To the south of us is an area of broken land called the Warp Fields. It's full of rogue and uncontrolled voidwalkers, but I like to think of them as walking batteries.If you can bring me enough of their essence, I can convert the zeppelin's engine to run on it. Five gold says I'll even get better mileage out of it, too!9352Besides the constant threat that the Wretched represent, I also have to deal with all kind of fictitious reports of night elf sightings.Though most reports are unfounded, one recent incident demands further investigation.  The West Sanctum, one of our primary energy sources, has suffered a terrible malfunction and rumors of Darnassian sabotage are rampant.Travel there and deal with anyone that looks suspicious.  Report back to Ley-Keeper Velania, who watches over the sanctum.9355Well met, . Now that reinforcements are finally arriving, we can recapture some semblance of a normal life.One of our first goals is to restore the flow of men and goods along the road to the southwest, but it must be reclaimed from the crust bursters that've overrun the area.If you're willing to help us deal with this menace, you would have the gratitude of the Sons. Watch carefully for the disturbed ground they leave in their wake.9356Screed likes to say his flying is as \"smooth as butter.\" I think \"butterfingered\" is more like it!Take a look at the wreckage over there. He calls it a \"rough\" landing.Sure, we got shot at, but I'd be willing to cut him a little more slack if he didn't brag about his piloting skills so often!I think I'm going to make him a batch of wings to drive the point home. To the east, in the Valley of Bones, you'll find bonestripper buzzards. Their wings are plump, juicy, and perfect for my needs.9358Don't take the safety of this village for granted.  We're under siege by the Scourge on the east and the Wretched to the west.Ranger Sareyn keeps our borders safe from the undead that pour in from the Dead Scar.  Follow the road eastwards out of town and see if you can lend her a hand.9359Your help in subduing the Wretched has been invaluable.  The Farstriders would surely have use for someone like you in their fight against the Amani trolls.Look for the Farstrider Retreat to the northeast of here, speak to Lieutenant Dawnrunner and see what assistance she might need.9360Though you don't understand the language in these battle plans, you clearly make out a map marking the positions of the Farstrider Retreat and Fairbreeze Village.You'd best let Lieutenant Dawnrunner at the Farstrider Retreat know about this.9361Those eggs are superb, but what do you say we kick it up another notch?A side of bacon would round out the meal perfectly and I know just where to get it.This place is littered with helboars. Of course, there's no one here to inspect and tenderize the meat, but we're in luck!This wasn't made for use on pork, but cooking is as much about improvisation as anything else!9362There isn't much time, !  My scrying spells have revealed a powerful source of magic.  I cannot leave the tower, and would ask you to kill the vile creature in possession of this artifact.The pathetic little cretin is known as Warlord Krellian, hiding behind his guards in the Temple of Zin-Malor.  Burn him to ashes and take the prismatic shell he covets so dearly.9363Go to Fairbreeze Village and notify Ranger Degolien of the Amani plans.  Even with Zul'Marosh dead, Fairbreeze must prepare for a troll attack.  Tell Degolien I will send him reinforcements as soon as possible.9364My research has revealed a unique purpose for the prismatic shell.Carry the shell and cast your polymorph spell on the Spitelash in Azshara.  If you wait a few moments, the chaotic aura of the shell will cause them to split into several smaller clones for a few moments.  Kill these clones as quickly as possible, and the shell will collect their essence.When the shell is full, return it to me.93659366Northeast of here lie the Pools of Aggonar.  Once a sacred site to the draenei, their waters were corrupted after the blood from the demon Aggonar was spilled into them.That blood, though old and diluted, still possesses tremendous power.  Terrorfiends now walk the area, empowered by the pure demonic energies of the original blood.  Slay them and retrieve as much felblood as you can.  I'll make it worth your while.9369We are the draenei.  Our ship crashed and, since we have many wounded, our immediate concern is the depleted state of our healing crystals.  We must replenish them quickly!Unfortunately, the only way to do this at this point is to extract the blood from the local vale moths.  Their blood will make for a suitable substitute.The moths can be found in many places around the vale, but mostly in the northwest.9370Our scouts captured a draenei paladin at the Pools of Aggonar.  He was to take part in a cleansing ritual to purify the pools.  We must stop the draenei from succeeding or we will lose our supply of felblood!He was carrying this signaling gem, looking to mark a spot where a priest - or \"anchorite\" as they call themselves - could perform their rituals in safety.  Place the gem near the Altar of Aggonar and be ready to ambush any approaching draenei.I suggest that you take a friend or two along.9371, Botanist Taerix is in need of your assistance. You'll find her with her apprentices to the west, outside the ship.9372Welcome to the Cenarion Post, . We don't often get company out here, but I'm grateful for the visit. My work with the creatures of this desolate land requires me to travel to many remote places.The Cenarion Expedition has dispatched me to study some of the most dangerous wildlife in Outland, and I've made a startling discovery. While many creatures here have already undergone radical changes, they continue to mutate. I'm collecting blood samples to document the changes, and any help would be welcome.9373Upon examining the battered leather case, it becomes apparent that the container's damage must've been caused by the caustic fluid of the worm's digestive tract. The leather appears to have been intricately tooled at one time, but the details of its adornment can no longer be made out.The only recognizable feature of the case is a worn logo of the Cenarion Circle. Knowing nothing about the contents of the case, you decide the best course of action would be to deliver it to a Circle member.9374My husband, Arelion, had been fascinated with the Pools of Aggonar ever since we arrived in Outland.  He spent much of his time studying slimes, of all things!He went missing in there a few days ago.  They say he's dead and there's nothing I can do about it.One thing I can do is try to ensure that his research doesn't die with him.  Go northeast to the pools and look for his journal.  He always carried it inside a brown knapsack.9375Please, , get me out of this cage! I foolishly set out from Thrallmar ahead of the main group, despite Martik Tor'seldori's warnings.I was set upon by horrible creatures that could only be the ravagers he talked about. I managed to drive them off, but that was only the beginning of my troubles.As I bound my wounds, those bird men found me, dragged me back to this cave, and locked me in this cage! I must get to Falcon Watch!9376That wounded pilgrim seems to be shouting something about a pack.When you encountered her, did you see a pack nearby? Hmm...She must've left it when fleeing from her attackers. The quillfang ravagers, in their ravine to the south, are known to attack solitary travelers.If she doesn't calm down, I won't be able to tend her wounds. Her stubbornness may just cost her her life.Go to Dustquill Ravine and see if you can find her campsite. I'm willing to bet she left it there.9381With the influx of pilgrims and the encroachment of Alliance forces, things around Falcon Watch have gotten quite busy lately. In my spare time, I usually help prepare batches of arrows for the rangers, but I haven't had the chance to gather feathers for the fletching in a long time.I could offer you a bit of coin if you'd be willing to gather the tail feathers of the bonestripper vultures. In the past, I've found them circling the bones of large beasts to the north of Falcon Watch.9383The blood elves epitomize the irresponsible use of magic, . They do not control magical energy. Rather, they are slaves to it and will suffer nothing to stand between them and their addiction. They consume the energies of Outland's voidwalkers to power their demonic magics.I've prepared a crystal charged with a spell that will allow us to neutralize a voidwalker and sever its link to this world when destroyed. I've mostly seen the voidwalkers in the Warp Fields to the southeast of Hellfire Citadel.9385So Honor Hold sends us to deal with the arakkoa and we set up camp here thinking hey isn't this a great spot.  Little did we know how close we were to the quillfang ravagers.They are relentless predators and have made any sort of work on our part impossible.  There's a bit of coin in it for you if you can deal with them for us.  Do you feel up to it?9387Uncorrupted draenei, like this unlucky fellow here, are virtuous champions of the Light.  What corruption caused their great race to devolve into the Broken and Lost Ones?I've heard a theory that exposure to fel energies is what caused the mutation.  I would like to put that theory to the test.Northwest of here lie the Ruins of Sha'naar.  There you will find lowly Broken commanded by Illidari taskmasters.  Bring me demonic essences from the taskmasters so that I can test them on this draenei.9390Hear my plight, .  My brother, Sedai, left long ago to contact the orcs of Mag'har Post.  Ever the idealist, he thought the time was ripe to set our differences aside and negotiate a peace with them.He's been missing for days and I fear for the worst.Would you set my mind to rest and look for him?  Sedai must be somewhere nearby to the east.9391With the rock flayer population thinned, all that's left is to signal the safe path to our pilgrims.  Return to the Great Fissure with this torch and seek the three beacons that mark the path from the east.Light the three beacons and return to me.  Be warned that the beacons will attract any nearby rock flayers when you first light them.9392As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young rogues here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Pathstalker Kariel.  Speak with Kariel and see what training he has available for you.  The things he will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you.Kariel - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.9393As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.

Someone must have forgotten to tell him to leave when the magister and everyone else did.  I know that he's still somewhere around here on the grounds, but I dare not go looking for him myself with all of these magical creatures roaming about.Will you find him for me, , and make sure that he's alright?9395I swear that I'm going to fireball someone if I get one more request from Lord Saltheril concerning supplies for his party!  Do I look like a party planner?!  Between you and me, that fool and his sycophants are living in denial that we're under attack here!Some of us are actually busy with, oh, I don't know, defending what's left of Quel'Thalas!  , would you please head over to Saltheril's Haven and see if you can shut him up?  It's just down the road to the west.9396Outland holds many secrets, .  It's only a matter of time before we uncover them all.The half-bird, half-man species of the arakkoa possesses ancient arcane knowledge that would aid us greatly in our exploration of this world.  Travel to the Den of Haal'esh, south of here.  Obtain any magical scrolls that the Haal'eshi might be carrying on them and bring them to me.9397The Haal'eshi arakkoa have domesticated a beautiful bird species called the kaliri.I've managed to capture a young male and they appear to be trainable.  The females are much rarer, but if I had one I could attempt to breed them.  She has to be young, though... a hatchling.  An older wild bird wouldn't survive in captivity.Take this cage and travel south, to the Den of Haal'esh.  Search the nests for eggs that are ready to hatch.  If you bring me back a female hatchling, I'll reward you handsomely.9398The Broken that live in Outland have endured endless violence.  It is of little surprise that as soon as the Dark Portal opened they flocked to it in droves with hopes of escaping this land.Unfortunately for our confused brothers and sisters coming from the south, the rock flayers that inhabit the Great Fissure see them as easy prey.  Go there and thin the rock flayer population, so that our kin might have a chance.9399You probably think most Broken are evil, don't you?  In reality many just lack guidance.Before I met the Omenai, I too was lost.Our minds suffered terrible pain from the orcs' demonic magic.  We are easily confused and taken advantage of.Demons allied with Illidan raid Hellfire daily and capture our kind as slaves.  With the Omenai we now have hope.  Travel to the Ruins of Sha'naar, southwest of here, and slay the Illidari taskmasters so my people may be free!9400, we recently uncovered a plot to assassinate our envoy to Falcon Watch.  Hellfire Citadel learned of our plans to send an expedition there earlier this morning and set up an ambush.Our scouts have informed me that an assassin known as Krun Spinebreaker waits along the road north of the Citadel.  Go there and slay this assassin.  Show the fel orcs we're not to be trifled with!9401You pull the stone axe out of the body to examine it more closely.  There's something unusual about the craftsmanship of the weapon.Its origin appears orcish, though the materials aren't like anything you've seen before.  Nazgrel might be interested in seeing the weapon.9402So...  is it?  Don't be flattered I know your name, one of my students has been fawning over you and won't shut up.Hmm... if you'd like to impress , why don't you do something for me?  There's an azure phial at the bottom of the pond behind me.  Dive in, retrieve it, and bring it here.9403Now that you've learned a little lesson, I'll offer you something more substantial.  It concerns your ability to defend yourself in close combat.  Of course, you should only resort to melee in the most dire of circumstances, but that is no excuse to be unprepared.I can assist you in creating a staff befitting a mage of your learning.  Simply take the phial you retrieved for me and fill it at the base of Elrendar Falls.  Just follow the river southeast from here.9404You may have noticed the walking trees near Elrendar Falls.  As the keepers of nature, they are infused with a primal magic we can reform to our own purposes using the pure water you have already brought to me.Unfortunately, the green keepers are gnarled and twisted creatures, so you may need to kill a few before you find a useable branch.9405As you know, the warchief put his power behind this expedition for one reason.  This is the world we came from.  This is where our roots lie.This journey means different things to orcs and blood elves.  To them it's a search for the promised land.  To us it's more like returning home.Whoever made this axe is familiar with the old ways and we must contact them.  This is too important for us to use ordinary tracking methods.  Show the weapon to Far Seer Regulkut; she will know what to do.9406This news you bring from beyond the Dark Portal...  you want us to believe the son of Durotan ruled over the lands beyond it... free from any demonic taint?  And that now his people have returned to this world?I hope for your sake that this isn't some manner of joke, .  What this means to my people... cannot be described.  I must send word to Nagrand at once!  Hellscream must hear about this.Take this letter back to your leader in Thrallmar.  Tell him the Mag'har welcome them!9407For years the Dark Portal loomed silent... forgotten.  But it is silent no longer.After stopping the demonic assault here, our forces breached the portal and met the demons on their own ground!Now, we are locked in a savage war, and there are some who think we might not win.  So it is our duty, our grim pleasure, to battle the fiends of Outland and ensure our victory, .If you would help us, then report to Lieutenant General Orion at once. He awaits you in the Outland...9409Now that you've gathered all that we need to replenish our healing crystals, I need you to deliver the vials to Zalduun, our priest.  You'll find him tending to our wounded inside the central chamber of the ship.9410Even our best tracking wolves' senses can fail them, .  The spirits have a way of seeing the world differently than ours.  The being you will call forth will find the person you seek, for they'll be drawn not to their scent but their essence.Go now, , take this totem with you and use it at the location you found the stone axe.9415Are you Marshal Bluewall's new recruits? Of course you are.What are you waiting for? Good soldiers are dying in the desert. Aren't you excited to join them?Now, get going and don't dry out on the way.9416You must be one of General Kirika's new recruits. It's about time you showed up. Bodies wear down quick in the desert.The dwarves have been getting reinforcements daily, and we can't afford to lose ground in our struggle for resources in Silithus.Get your instructions from the General. It's not my job to train you, just find you.9417The arakkoa are smart creatures... smart as any gnome you ever met.  They have this way with magic and a violent temper, however. Lately they've taken to attacking Honor Hold patrols, which is why we were sent here.  See, Mirren and I are world-famous marksmen, we are!  But fowl and game are what we specialize in... not these... lightning-invoking birdmen.So what do you say you give us a hand in this one assignment?  You'll find the Den of Haal'esh to the southeast.9418I sense you're not of the arakkoa, so I will attempt to barter for my freedom.  My name is Aeranas. I once ruled over the eastern winds.  The Haal'eshi mage, Avruu, trapped me inside this orb.Find the altar the arakkoa used to enslave me.  It is hidden to the southeast of the arakkoa's den.  Approach it with the orb and give it to me once I'm free.  In exchange for my liberty I'll reward you with powerful treasure!9419We recently found out that the Horde has been scavenging the Silithus desert for resources, but paid them little mind. We thought it could not be worth it to station large numbers in this sweltering desert.However, it was discovered the importance of the resources, and now we are scrambling to catch up.If I have your assistance, you must go into the desert and recover the silithyst and return it here.9420The arakkoa at the Den of Haal'esh, south of here, breed a magnificent species of birds called kaliri.  Their feathers would fetch a bundle at the trading posts back in Azeroth.  Just think of all the ale I could buy then!Tell you what, you bring me a stack of kaliri feathers and I'll give you my very own hat.  What do you say?  You'll never find a hat like this one!  Do we have a deal?94219422For some time now, we have been tapping the crystal resources of the Silithus desert. The only dangers we faced were from the creatures that made this place their home and the oppressive sand and dust and heat.But now the Alliance seems to have caught on to what we have found here. It is now a race between us to capture the natural resources, and keep them from the other.I need every set of hands that is available. I hope I have yours.9423With Sedai's death confirmed, you're left with the unpleasant task of returning to Obadei with the grim news.9424Sedai was like a brother to Makuru.   We owe him our lives and more!  They call Makuru crazy but if the Omenai are not going to do anything about his death then they're the crazy ones!Makuru doesn't have much to call his own in this world, but he will give you his only possession if you avenge Sedai.  I've seen the brown orc Mag'har grunts before, up in the hills to the northeast.  They hate us!  They don't deserve our mercy!  Go, avenge Sedai!  Bring me their ancestral beads as proof!9426Much has changed since the days when we called this land Draenor.  Parts of the land have been forever changed by the demons' taint.One such place is known as the Pools of Aggonar.  It was once the location of our people's sacred springs.  The blood of the demon Aggonar fouled the very essence of the holy waters.  This fel blood has spawned foul beings that must be cleansed if we're ever to reclaim the pools.  Travel east of here and slay the Terrorfiends and slimes that wander the pools.9427I must ask that you finish what we've set in motion.  Now that the demonic influence has weakened you must take this cleansing vial and pour it at the very source of the taint - Aggonar's own corpse.You will find the demon's bones at the northern end of the pools.  Beware, I sense that Aggonar's essence has not quite left this world.9430As I've told you before, I do not require eyes to see what others cannot.  I will not pass judgment on what you did on Makuru's behalf, yet I think you need to see beyond what your eyes show you.Travel southwest to the Ruins of Sha'naar and salvage any relics you find.  If fate wills it you will find what we need.The meaning of my request might not be immediately apparent.  Have faith though, .  Clarity comes to those with patience.9436Well met, . I've made a habit of studying the fighting techniques of the various troll tribes in my travels, and I've noticed a trend. The Bloodscalp trolls at the Tkashi Ruins and Bal'lal Ruins to the north use some of the same tactics as the Amani of the northern forests.Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction and they've used it to become the strongest tribe in the area. It could form the core of a powerful weapon against the Amani, but first I must find out more about it.9437The ogres here are useful for little more than crude jokes, sour ale, and bouts of headbutting. When my ship, the Dawn Runner, ran aground, those curs from Theramore made off with my cargo and last surviving crewman. I made my way here searching for help, but those good-for-nothing ogres stared blankly at me when I told them my story.I could use the help of a reliable  in recovering what remains of my cargo and freeing Ithania from North Point Tower, to the northeast, where they're being held.9442It is good that you've offered to aid us, .  Our grunts have fallen sick from drinking contaminated water and I'm missing an ingredient to produce a healing salve.  I'm in need of a rare mushroom called drycap.Our foremost orders are to keep our location secret and not risk being spotted while looking for it, or I would go myself.  The only place in Hellfire Peninsula where drycap grows is a cave at the Great Fissure, south of here.Be extremely careful if you choose to seek it.9447I've prepared a simple salve that should restore our grunts' strength with the herbs you brought me.  Take it and administer it to any debilitated grunts you see in the vicinity.  Return to me when you're done.9452I've found that these waters are bustling with red snapper, a very tasty fish. With a fishing net, I can catch enough to feed dozens of draenei! Unfortunately, I was recently attacked by a creature known as a murloc while netting in the river and have suffered some injuries that prevent me from doing my job. I need help!Use this fishing net near schools of red snapper, found in the Crystalbrook river to the east, to catch the fish.What do you say? Remember to return the net when you are finished.9453You did a wonderful job, . Our people will be thankful for this bounty. With that said, would you mind taking this haul of red snapper to Acteon at Azure Watch?He shouldn't be hard to find as he is awaiting this catch.9454You're starting to make a name for yourself, . How about trying your hand at hunting?Back on Draenor, our greatest hunters would hunt a beast that resembled the moongraze stag of this region known as a talbuk.If you think yourself draenei enough, go out into the wilds and kill enough stags to fill your pack with meat.You will find them grazing south of Azure Watch. Watch out for their horns!9455The crystal you found on the nightstalker runt's body appears to be a piece of the Exodar. This may help explain the unusual appearance and demeanor of some of the animals in this region.Take the crystal back to Azure Watch. The exarch will surely want to know about this discovery.9456I'm not going to make any excuses for what you've found. This is clearly our fault. We had gotten reports of crushed crystal fragments showing up in the river to the east but chose to ignore the implications. Now we can either sit around on this island and cry about the tragedy that has befallen this land or we can do something about it and prevent it from spreading.If you've got the stomach for it, I want you to go back into the wilds and kill as many of the infected nightstalkers as you can find.9457So this Naias is the mastermind behind the Bloodscalp and their exotic magic? I'll admit, this is the last place I expected my inquiry to lead, but no matter, our findings may still prove useful.Off the coast to the northwest is an island inhabited by lesser water elementals. There's a crude stone slab there that might serve as an altar for the likes of the trolls. Take the totem you found to that altar. Let's see if we can draw this Naias out and distill his power into a more agreeable form.9463I have found that lashers milling about on the island hold restorative medicinal properties in their vines. Through proper treatment, the vines can be broken down into a powerful healing ointment. Unfortunately, with so many injured draenei passing through Azure Watch, we are always in short supply.Our delicate guest was found injured and unconscious by the Crystalbrook only yesterday. If you bring me vines, we may be able to save her.You will find root trappers both south and east of Azure Watch.9466By order of the Ranger Captain, a reward is hereby offered for the slaying of the vicious rockflayer matriarch known as Blacktalon the Savage.Blacktalon was last sighted inside a cave in the Great Fissure.

You might find some at Cenarion Refuge, just inside Zangarmarsh, west of here.9473The girl is too far gone for mere ointments to be effective. There may be another way...The forest of Azuremyst holds many secrets, one of those being a rare plant known as the azure snapdragon that some claim to be a panacea - a cure all.You can identify the plant by its stark contrast to the other plants of Azuremyst and its need to grow at the base of the azure pine trees. Make haste!And , be wary of the root threshers of the region as they consume snapdragon for sustenance.94839487Arcane reavers are magical creations of brute strength.

From their remains, collect the crystallized fragments of magical energy and return to me.

Good luck!9498My people recently finished building Falcon Watch, a base of operations in the southwestern region of Hellfire Peninsula - beyond Hellfire Citadel.  You are welcome there as an ally, .If you're looking for work, go there and tell Ranger Captain Venn'ren that I sent you.  He will see to it that you're given tasks worthy of someone of your caliber.9499What are you still doing here, ?  Didn't you hear we built a proper sin'dorei outpost here in Hellfire Peninsula?Surely you'd rather be among fellow blood elves and away from all this... smell.

I would recommend travelling with companions.  Blood elves, preferably.9505The Prophet spoke of this day: That on this island, in this new world, our allies would find us.\"We will be tested. They will ask that we pay for the sins of our fathers...\"At the time, I did not understand the meaning behind his words, but seeing this creature and her reaction to us, it is now coming into focus. The corruption of our people has been felt even here.Venture south. It is there that we found this being. Find its kin and tell them of our people.9506I am Admiral Odesyus of Alliance Naval Command. Our ship was forced to port on your island due to an infestation of sorts. It's embarrassing to even talk about, but goblins somehow managed to stow away in the holds of both of my ships.Last night, while most of the ship's crew was asleep below deck, they struck!Stranger still, they took our navigation gear and jumped ship!They disappeared into the thicket, east of here. Will you go in search of our gear? It will make for a strong gesture.9512The Admiral be right, ye are a resourceful one. Mayhap ye could help Cookie out?If I serve the crew chicken for dinner again, I'll be sent to the brig fer sure.I noticed that thar be crawlers all along the coastline - lots o' crawlers! Bring me crawler meats and I'll be forever indebted to ya.Help a reformed pirate out?9513While some may look at our current predicament as an unfortunate turn of events, I sense that we are here for a reason. The invisible hand of fate has pushed us in this direction. The reason why will become evident in time.To the west lies an ancient night elf city, now in ruin and overrun with naga. It would be remiss of me to sit idly by as the naga tainted my ancestral lands.You have shown yourself a capable . Honor my people and cleanse the ruins of their unwelcome inhabitants.9514You cannot make out any of the symbols on the tablet. Perhaps the priestess would be able to decipher the mysterious runes.9515A naga invasion would be disastrous, . I've seen what naga can do and I would not want to see such a catastrophe befall any being. If I were to guess, this Warlord Sriss'tiz will be hidden in a cave - probably along the coast to the west.Find Warlord Sriss'tiz and put an end to his reign.9523The priestess tells me that the ruins to the west are what's left of a night elf civilization. That got me thinking about what my pappy used to always say about night elf ruins, \"Sonny, whenever you see night elf ruins, night elf relics are sure to be close by.\"Now what kind of a dwarf would I be if I didn't hire the first person I saw to go digging up night elf relics for me? Now get going!9527We had lived peacefully among the Owlbeasts of this island for many years. You can imagine my surprise when they stormed the beach and attacked us.I fought tooth and nail but was easily overpowered. As I blacked out from the vicious blows that I had been dealt, I prayed that my family not suffer.When I awoke, all was quiet. The sand was soaked red with blood - their blood. They were devoured whole.I care not for vengeance, . I only ask that their remains be returned to me for proper burial.9528My family was attacked by the murlocs and owlkin of this island several weeks ago. I managed to escape but I think that both my mother and father have been slain. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I must try and get back to my home - or what's left of it... Will you help me get through the forest?9529While I'm certain your imp has proven a useful and sometimes entertaining servant, it is time you mastered a more powerful demon: the voidwalker.Travel down the Dead Scar until it is crossed by the Elrendar River.  Just south of the river, locate one of the blue glowing stones and take it.  Your path will be revealed there.9530I've wondered about this for some time now, but this proves it to be true.There is a traitor among us.The plans left behind by the goblins document the conspiracy. Since I don't know who it could be, I'm going to need your help in finding the traitor. None of my crew can be trusted.If this is going to work, I'm going to need a hollowed out tree and leaves. Search near the loggers north of us for the tree. You'll need to find the leaves by yourself. Check the forest.9531According to the plans, the traitor and the leader of the goblins, Geezle, are to meet at a cove on the western island. I need you to be at that meeting, .Remember the tree and leaves? You're going to wear them! It's a perfect disguise.Go to the cove and look for a naga flag. If the flag is there, it means a meeting is planned. Use the disguise kit when you see the flag and wait. Eventually the traitor will show up. Let the meeting finish then return to me with the identity of the scoundrel.9537Spark must be brought to justice!I need you to go down to the beach and find that deceitful gnome. Once you find him, get whatever information you can out of him!If a high ranking official of the Alliance has committed treasonous acts, who knows how many others are corrupt?And , use force if you have to...9538I think I've cracked it, !All that we need to know about the Stillpine furbolg language is imprinted on their totems. With just a rudimentary understanding of how their symbols work, we can study the totems and learn to communicate with the furbolgs.I've written down the basics of the symbol matrix on this parchment. Study it and then examine the totem. It should lead you to the next language totem.Speak to Arugoo when you return an educated !9539You begin to read the totem, barely able to pronounce the awkward words and phrases. Slowly, words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go up the nearby hill, to the northeast.9540You begin to read the totem, better able to pronounce the words and phrases. Words start to form in your head. You think that the totem is telling you to go across the Crystalbrook river to the east. Perhaps your destination is on the other side of the river.9541The symbols on this totem seem to translate much faster. The patterns and imagery all seem to blend into familiar words. You are fairly certain the totem is pointing you south, down the river. Something is at the bottom of the river itself.9542You no longer see unrecognizable symbology in the totems. The totem of Yor reads to you just as easily as your native tongue.The markings identify another furbolg den, due west of here. You are able to expertly decipher the language on the totem and know that your destination is Bristlelimb Village. Yor will guide you but if you get lost, you know that you are able to take the ancient elven road in the forest leading west to reach your destination.9543Our history with the orcs is one of constant conflict, .  We were once near driven to extinction due to their bloodlust and have since then avoided them even when not under demonic influence.Yet, this retaliation... it's not what Sedai would've wanted.  Speak with our elder, Amaan the Wise.  He will help shed light on these events.9544The images on this totem depict a war between the Stillpine and the Bristlelimb furbolg tribes. The etchings show that the Bristlelimb have done unconscionable things to the furbolgs of Stillpine.Amidst the chaos, a prophecy has begun to unfold: A hero will rise - not of furbolg blood - and save the Stillpine tribe.Slay Bristlelimb furbolgs at Bristlelimb Village for their keys. Use the keys to free the Stillpine captives. Return to Arugoo of the Stillpine when you have freed them all!9545The stubborn close their mind and convince themselves of one truth.  The wise keep an open mind to the different possibilities leading to and stemming from the present.Take this relic with you to where you found Sedai.  See not with your eyes, , but with your mind.9548Shh! Keep your voice down and don't call attention to me.If the murlocs detect my presence, the experiment will be ruined! I've already come perilously close to contaminating my data.While I was foraging yesterday, one of them must've wandered too close and discovered my camp. I returned just in time to see two of them carrying off a crate with most of my equipment! It's bound to be in one of their settlements around here, but I can't risk revealing my presence. Are you willing to help?9549My observations and writings about the Blacksilt murlocs are quite illuminating, , but they are just the beginning. I plan to return to Ironforge with items produced by the Blacksilts' rudimentary crafting skills.The problem is that the Blacksilt carry these items with them at all times, and I can't have their blood on my conscience. If you're willing to help me gather the idols carried by Blacksilt seers and crude knives of the Blacksilt warriors and shorestrikers, I won't ask how you came by them.9550The crudely-drawn map reveals nothing of its maker, but it appears to have been drawn with an unsteady hand. Wavering lines and symbols depict a small pavilion with broken columns located to the west of a partially submerged tower. If the map is to be believed, this cluster of ruins appears to be located on the eastern coast of the island. You have no idea what you'll find, but it was important enough for the map's creator to record.9557Lacking the means to read the book's contents, you think about who might be able to help you separate the author's words from the mapmaker's scrawl.Remembering Anchorite Paetheus's collection of artifacts from countless cultures, you wonder if his experienced eye might be able to help you decipher the book's contents.9558We were having a problem with arakkoa bandits raiding many of our supply caravans, so I hired some dwarves to take care of them.They were brothers; Gremni Longbeard was the oldest.I'm a little worried about them.  Those crazy dwarves packed more ale than food or ammunition!  Maybe you can go check up on them?The arakkoa's hideout, the Den of Haal'esh, can be found to the far west of here - beyond the Great Fissure.  They set up camp northwest of there, south of Dustquill Ravine.9559Promised one, you must travel north to the home of my people - Stillpine Hold. It is there that you will face your most daunting challenge.Go now, High Chief Stillpine awaits your arrival.9560My brother and I were hunting in the woods to the east when we were ambushed by strange, insect-like beasts. Such aberrations have never before been seen in Azuremyst! Could they be a sign of the coming apocalypse? The apocalypse that YOU are destined to prevent?If you truly are the Promised One, you will strike the creatures of the apocalypse down... and bring me their hides. From their hides, I can fashion armor of great power!Find them to the east, beyond the road.9561The translation is ready now, .'The enemy is nearly upon us. We've gathered up all the survivors and retreated to the temple to the east. It's the last ground we truly hold on the island, and there is a sense among the survivors that we will make our last stand here.

Even the murlocs are kicking our tails - literally. Unfortunately, more than just my ego has been bruised.While our relationship with the Siltfin murlocs had always been tenuous, never could we have imagined that they would have the gall to attack us and steal from our food stores! Travel west to the Silting Shore and recover our stolen food-stuffs!And if you see a dark-skinned murloc with a patch of white fur stuck in between his webbed toes...9563So you want to gain our trust?  I don't trust many people these days.We lost one of our own not long ago to the arakkoa.  It's got me a bit on edge.Tell you what, if you can prove your loyalty to Honor Hold and... bring me a mug of Nethergarde Bitter... yes, that sounds rather good about now... I'll have a deal to offer you then.Bernie at Nethergarde Keep keeps the bitter in stock.9564You recover the piece of fur that Gurf had \"lost\" in his struggle with the murlocs. Return the fur to Gurf and let him know that the fearsome Murgurgula has been slain.9565As High Chief, my immediate concern is the root of the corruption in Stillpine Hold.Why did the wildkin - once our allies - attack us? Why have they taken residence in Stillpine Hold?Perhaps something inside will hold the answer. Search Stillpine Hold for clues as to the source of corruption.9566On the surface, the crystal appears to be a piece of the Exodar. Something has gone terribly wrong with this crystal, however, as it is blood red and rapidly dissolving into the water supply of the cave.This may explain the unusually aggressive behavior of the creatures in Azuremyst. Return to High Chief Stillpine with this information.9567It's good to see another new face here in Blood Watch, . Although the blood elves are the most immediate threat, there are other sinister creatures that call Bloodmyst Isle home.The Nazzivus satyr are of particular concern. They are foul, demonic creatures, commanding dark magics and feeding on the corruption created by the Exodar's crash.We must hold them in check, but first we must learn more about them. Go southwest to Nazzivian and learn what you can from their grotesque monument.9569Now that we have made our presence known to the satyr, we must send a message that we will not tolerate the Burning Legion's hounds in these lands.Too long have the draenei fled in the wake of the Legion and its minions, . Wherever they have found us, they have shown no mercy.We must not permit the satyr to exploit the Exodar's crash and use the corrupted crystals as weapons. Go north to where their leader resides in Axxarien, destroy him, and recover the corrupted crystals he has been gathering!9570After the crystal storm had subsided, a beast of myth appeared in our village. Brought here by the invading wildkin, this beast, the Kurken, laid waste to our village. Many Stillpine were slain in defense of our lands by this fiend and many have since lost their lives attempting to subdue the beast.In my visions, I have seen one defeat the Kurken. The one must be you, . You are our only hope. Enter Stillpine Hold and slay the Kurken. Bring me his hide as proof of deed.9571Take the Kurken's hide to Moordo, on the other side of the village. He will fashion the hide into an item of your choice.9573I am Stillpine the Younger, heir to the Stillpine legacy. As you can see, my defenders have set up a death trap for the raving wildkin that attack from inside Stillpine Hold. While we are able to hold them off out here, none of my defenders have been able to infiltrate the hold. If you could get inside and slay their leader, it might give us an opportunity to strike!Find Chieftain Oomooroo and destroy him. Slay any crazed wildkin that you encounter inside as well.9574Bloodmyst Isle was forever changed by our arrival. The Exodar's crash scattered debris all over the islands and I think it's beginning to have an adverse effect on the wildlife.Before I can be certain of my conclusion, I'll need to get a closer look. The crystals seem to have affected the trees the fastest, so it seems that the treants would be the most likely to show symptoms. If you bring me samples of bark from corrupted treants, I can begin my in-depth studies.9576Examining the crudely constructed pendant, you notice the crystal pulsating softly. Though it emits little light, you can almost feel the crystal radiating a sense of wrongness.You're not quite sure what might have possessed Cruelfin to create this pendant, but the find is too important to ignore. You should probably show it to someone at Blood Watch.9578Do you think often of your family, ? There were a number of families aboard the Exodar, but I've heard of very few being reunited.I, myself, am looking for traces of my husband Galaen, who was a technician in the Cryo-Core. The wreckage of it is located to the west, and it's swarming with blood elves!I must find out what became of Galaen! Even news of his death is better than never knowing. My husband will be wearing a pendant identical to my own; they were a gift from my sister.9579You have no means of identifying the corpse as Galaen with the information Morae gave you, but the clothing appears to have been torn in search of valuables.The blood elves in the area would've claimed anything of value from the wreckage, including Galaen's jeweled amulet.Although her husband did not survive the crash, you believe that Morae would be grateful if you recovered her husband's amulet from the blood elves.9580As I'm sure you've seen in your time on Bloodmyst Isle, very little remains unchanged by our arrival. My training and experience has taught me that even the products of an environment like this one can be put to use.With so few resources, we must rely on our ingenuity to provide for us. I've been supplementing our stores with meat from the bears that wander this island. With the proper preparation, it can safely be eaten. If you're going to be out in the field, why not help replenish our stocks?9581Welcome to Blood Watch, . Seeing to the defenses of the outpost is my primary concern, but I've also been tasked with a variety of other duties by our leaders at the Exodar.The problem is that it's hardly safe to send out large amounts of researchers when the island is this dangerous. I need someone to gather a series of crystal samples from various sites on the island.The first sample I need must come from the ravager infested ship debris south of the town and across the bridge.9582When the ship crashed, our menagerie was scattered on the northeast beaches of this isle.  I have been handed a key that unlocks the cage holding one of the deadlier specimens, a death ravager.  The creature is little armored but resistant to most magic.  It must be killed by a simple blade.Take this key and release the creature from both its prison and its pain.  We cannot afford to have it escape and cause even more damage to the ecology than we already have.9584Now that we have the baseline crystal, we're going to need samples from more dangerous areas of the island to complete the set I'll be sending to the Exodar.The next sample must come from the crystals controlled by the blood elves in the Bladewood area to the northwest of Blood Watch. I have heard reports that they alter and harvest the crystals for use in some magical apparatus. See if you can find one that has not yet been incorporated into one of their devices, and mine a sample from it.9585There's just one sample remaining before I can send this set of crystals to the Exodar, . The final sample must come from the satyr stronghold of Axxarien to the northwest.I'm not certain what to expect from this crystal sample, but I'm sure there will be some signs of corruption. Take care to mine your shard from the crystal that looks like the ones you took your previous samples from, or else our researchers cannot make a valid comparison.9594The armor scrap is forged from a deep black metal that seems to absorb light. Although it doesn't appear to be enchanted, there is an unmistakable sense of wrongness about it.Such armor is only used by one force - the Burning Legion. The Legion's presence here can only mean that they're intending to mobilize the island's satyr against the draenei.Take action against the local satyr, then return to Blood Watch and show this armor scrap to Vindicator Aalesia.9595You have chosen the path of the , and so you must learn control. Magic, when unchecked, can corrupt souls and destroy worlds.To fully understand, you must face one who has been consumed by magic. Travel to the beaches on the northwest coast of Azuremyst Isle and use your spells to decimate the murlocs. The display of power will attract the attention of the evil force lurking there, a Quel'dorei magewraith. Defeat it.When you have finished, seek out Bati at the Vault of Lights in the Exodar.9602You must get this information to your people, . While your brave acts have certainly slowed down the plans of Kael'thas and his dark master, the attacks will undoubtedly continue.Take the traitor's communication to your leaders. They must see this for themselves. Perhaps they will be able to better understand some of what was written.9603Welcome to Azure Watch, . Please excuse the disorder you see around you. It's easy to take simple things for granted, like a fully furnished and stocked inn, until you're forced to build one from nothing.We've managed to salvage this pod for a building, but without the proper furnishings and first aid supplies, the inn is little more than a glorified tent. Nurguni at the Exodar has offered to put together a package to help with our most immediate needs, but I need someone to deliver this list to him.9604For a small fee, you can rent one of my hippogryphs to fly you to the Exodar.Taking the hippogryph is a faster, not to mention safer, alternative for someone carrying an important message. If you'd like to take a ride, speak to me again and I'll make the arrangements.9605Here's the box, . That should be enough for Chellan to get the inn up and running. Let her know that she can keep sending in orders as the need arises. Azure Watch urgently needs a place to care for the wounded and put up any travelers they receive.When you're ready to return to Azure Watch, seek out Stephanos near the Seat of the Naaru in the Exodar.9606If I remember correctly, Azure Watch's hippogryph master is Zaldaan.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my hippogryphs to him.That's a good lesson to know: hippogryphs are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote hippogryph master after you've already been there.Since you arrived on one of Zaldaan's hippogryphs, you can also use that route to return to Azure Watch with the caregiver's supplies.9612You saved my life, ! Thank you so much! That beast would have torn me to shreds if it weren't for you.If you see the exarch at Azure Watch, tell him of what you did. I'm sure he'll be pleased to hear such news!9616This appears to be a bounty ledger. You cannot understand the blood elf language but you note that there is a picture depicting a dead draenei, a smiling blood elf standing over the corpse, and a symbol of what you think is some sort of blood elf currency.They've put a hit out on draenei! You must inform the exarch.9620As we've gotten ourselves established here at Blood Watch, I've been sending out survey teams to create more reliable maps of the island. In most cases, they returned unharmed with the data we need, but the team I sent east to the ruins hasn't reported back.I worry about what might have happened to them, but I can't spare the men to send another mission after them. Find them, , and lend them any assistance they require to return with their survey data.9621There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies.  Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home?This changes everything.  No longer will our power be questioned.  We'll be able to join the Horde as equals.Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the Forsaken.  She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears.  Prepare for a long trip, .  If all goes well she will send you to Orgrimmar.9622The Hold is saved and soon my people will make their way back to the ancestral home. The prophecy has come to pass and a new age of prosperity begins for the Stillpine.But I fear that darkness looms ahead for your own people. There are questions left unanswered - visions of prophecy unseen.Return to your leaders and tell them of what you have seen here.And Promised One, should you ever require the aid of Stillpine, you have merely to ask.9623You have survived the wilds of our new home and shown yourself a cut above the others. I believe that you have come of age to assist those battling on the front lines of Bloodmyst. The Hand of Argus could use a  like you. Report to Torallius the Pack Handler. You will find him outside the Exodar, tending to the elekk. Give him these orders so that he may direct you towards your new duties on Bloodmyst.9624I've made a wonderful discovery, . On the uncorrupted part of the island grows a remarkable fruit called the sand pear. They're found near the bottoms of the trees.I've been preparing pies from them, but if I'm not careful, the elekk will start to wander over and steal my fruit. I've taken to gathering enough to share with the animals, but my stores are gone and the craving for pie has returned. Would you be willing to help gather the fruit I need for another batch of pies? I promise I'll share!9625Is he crazy? Entrusting something like this to some no-named  youngling!Just remember this kid: You'll never make it as a Hand of Argus! You don't have the guts!I guess I'll have to humor him this time. Speak with Vorkhan at Kessel's Crossing on Bloodmyst Isle. Just follow the road north from here, and when it forks, just keep on going north.9626I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know.  I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to the Warchief in Orgrimmar.  As leader of the Horde he will have the final say on accepting your race's pledge.I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement.  Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.9627Your people suffered a great betrayal by the Alliance.  You've succeeded in fending off Darnassian attacks as well as spies from Ironforge.  Now you've defeated a powerful Scourge leader at the footsteps of your home.  Your worthiness is no longer in question.It is now apparent that you need us and we need you.  Return to Lor'themar.  Tell him I received his message loud and clear.Welcome to the Horde, elf.9628It's too late to assist the cartographers in completing their mission, but it appears they collected the data Harbinger Mikolaas was expecting. The crystal storing their survey information was not among their ransacked packs, so it must be in the hands of the Wrathscale naga.You know that Harbinger Mikolaas will be saddened by the loss of the survey crew, but would want to salvage the survey data.9629The Blacksilt murlocs on the southwestern coast are curious creatures. In some ways, they act barely sentient, yet in others, they show a remarkable degree of organization.I have a few theories about that, but no real way to test them until recently. I've devised a method that will allow me to track the murlocs I'm interested in without doing any lasting harm or interfering with their natural behavior. If you're willing to help with the marking, I'll gladly pay you for your assistance.9630Your name is getting around, .  You've made your way into and out of Karazhan - more than most mortals can claim.I need to ask a special favor of you.  As part of our research, the Violet Eye has been trying to track down Medivh's own journal.Unfortunately, none of the agents we've sent inside have come out.  Wravien was the last to be sent; see if you can find him and see about any leads on the journal.9631There is a small detail I've forgotten to take into account.  The residue of Medivh's essence contained in this bone fragment is completely devoid of life - just like Arcanagos.There is a way, however.  And I know just the person to help us.Travel to Area 52 in Netherstorm and show the bone fragment to Kalynna Lathred.  She will know just what to do.9632Harbinger Mikolaas has done a commendable job of safeguarding Blood Watch, , but our enemies are many and our resources few.Our weakness is well known to our enemies, but your contact with the forces of the Alliance is something they haven't accounted for. I have prepared a letter of introduction to the people of Auberdine, the closest Alliance settlement, proposing cooperation in the fight against our foes. Take it with you and seek out Huntress Kella Nightbow near the docks west of the Exodar.9634One thing we've learned in our travels is that extreme care must be taken when introducing wildlife from one world to another. When the Exodar crashed, it was carrying specimens of various Outland species, including an insectoid predator called the ravager.Some of the specimens were lost, but many others survived and took to the wild. If we don't keep them in check, they will upset the natural balance here on the islands.You'll find these ravagers to the west of Kessel's Crossing, near the coast.9635The swamp gas is truly amazing, and can be very useful, mon!  But first, you gotta be able to suck it up, and that, my friend, requires a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor.Now, I could just give you the schematics, but I'll need something in return first.  How about some spare parts?  Last time I checked, there were plenty lying around near the broken steam pump at the Dead Mire, far to the northeast.I heard that the withered giants spread the pieces all over that dried-out lake bed.9636Have you seen the swamp gas?  Isn't it just shiny?It takes a Zapthrottle Mote Extractor to suck 'em dry though.  I could give you the plans to make one, but I really need some spare parts to fix stuff 'round here.Last time I checked, there were plenty of parts lying around near the steam pump at the Dead Mire to the northeast.  I think the withered giants broke the pump out there.Shall we help each other out?9637I left the Kirin Tor in pursuit of knowledge forbidden by those of my order; it is beyond ironic that I am now asked to assist them with that very same knowledge.If I'm to perform this favor for you, you will have to do something for me first.  I want you to obtain two of the tomes I've been searching for.The first one is called the Tome of Dusk and is owned by the orc warlock known as Nethekurse.  The second, known as the Book of Forgotten Names, belongs to the arakkoa known as Darkweaver Syth.9638Was I supposed to be looking for this journal?  It can't be... I don't quite recall...Of course!  It is Gradav you're thinking of.  He was looking for the book when I got here.  Surely he must've found it by now; why don't you go ask him about it?I'd lend you a hand... but these books are just so... interesting!9639Journal, what journal?  You're thinking of Kamsis, surely.Go and ask her about it.  I can't leave my project right now or all my work will be wasted!9640Let me think for a second.  The Violet Eye... Medivh's Journal...  Why yes, it's all coming back to me now.I believe I had the journal you're looking for before I started to read these scrolls...Aran... yes, Aran asked me for the book.  So nicely too.  I just had to give it to him.  He's Medivh's father after all, did you know?9641The Exodar's crash scattered pieces of fouled crystals all over Bloodmyst Isle, corrupting the water and the landscape.We've even begun finding pieces of the crystals inside the flesh of animals taken for meat. I've uncovered a way to purify the shard and turn them into functional crystals, so if you bring me enough shards, I'll trade one of my completed crystals for them. So far I've found the shards in the bodies of bears, ravagers, flutterers, and treants inhabiting the corrupted part of the island.96429643A good woodsman makes use of every available resource, . Even the most bizarre creatures possess attributes we can use to our advantage.With Blood Watch under constant assault from the Sunhawks, we're looking to a variety of natural defenses including traps. The lasher's thorny vines are perfectly suited to the construction of the traps I have in mind. The combination of sharp spines and deadly toxin will fell unwary attackers. Bring me the vines of mutated constrictors so that I can begin my work.9644You fulfilled your end of the deal.  I will now bind your essence to that of the dead blue dragon.There is an urn in the Master's Terrace, should you touch that urn, you'll now release its energy and bring life back to the charred remains of Arcanagos.  Defeat the creature and retrieve its essence immediately!  You will need to take it to Alturus.Should you fail, the stars predict you will have let a great terror loose upon the skies.A terror known as Nightbane!9645Journal?  What journal?Oh, right.  That journal!  The Violet Eye sent me here for it.  It's all coming back now.This is the page that Alturus is interested in.  Did you know that while other people's journals serve as a record of their memories, Medivh's is literally just that?Try it.  Go to the Master's Terrace and read the page; you'll see just what I mean.  Might as well report to Alturus while you're at it.  I'm afraid I'll be here for a while.9646By order of Harbinger Mikolaas: A bounty of 18 silver to be paid to the brave soul who returns with proof of the marauding bear Deathclaw's demise.Deathclaw should be considered extremely dangerous and is responsible for the killing of a survey team on the coast to the northwest of Blood Watch. Travelers are advised to avoid the area.9647When we first encountered flutterers, they showed few signs of mutation. As the corruption got progressively worse, the moths and other species began to show signs of contamination.It has progressed to the point where they damage nearly everything they come in contact with. They're amplifying the damage being done by the crystal shards scattered by the Exodar's crash. We have no choice but to begin culling their population in the lands north of Blood Watch.9648Did you know mushroom hunting is far more dangerous than mushroom consumption? Mushroom hunters expose themselves to many unknowns - not including potential wildlife dangers!What would life be without a little danger? I am in need of mushrooms for my collection. Scattered throughout these unexplored wilds you will find four different types: An aquatic stinkhorn, a blood mushroom, a ruinous polyspore, and a fel cone fungus. They are each unique to various regions in Bloodmyst. Bring them to me.9649Good to see you again, ! You were exceptionally efficient in completing the last task that I offered you. Perhaps you would be interested in another?To the northeast lies Wyrmscar Island, home to a rare species of mushroom known as Ysera's tear - named after the green dragonlings that inhabit the island. I only require a small sampling of the mushroom, but I must warn you that the denizens of the island do not welcome visitors. Tread carefully.9663You're just in time, . Blood elf activity in this area has doubled in the past week. Our agents have informed us that the blood elves that call themselves Sunhawks plan to launch an offensive upon Azuremyst soon. I need you to get a warning out to our allies and compatriots.Warn High Chief Stillpine at Stillpine Hold, Exarch Menelaous at Azure Watch and Admiral Odesyus at Odesyus' Landing.Time is of the essence so I am lending you my elekk. Be sure to keep it out of water.9666Have you seen the serpent men? The ones that call themselves naga?They dared make an advance upon this camp under cover of darkness only three nights ago. Can you believe the audacity of those primitive beasts?I need you to deliver a message to their leadership, . To the northeast is Wrathscale Lair, home to Lord Xiz. Find him, slay him where he stands and drive this banner through his corpse.Let them know fear whenever they should see our standard!9667Help me, ! The Bristlelimb captured me and are planning to sacrifice me to their foul gods!High Chief Bristlelimb holds the key that opens the cage. To force him to appear, you must slaughter the evil Bristlelimb furbolgs that inhabit the enclave, just two camps to the west of this camp. If you kill enough of them, he will surely come for vengeance! When he shows up, kill him and get the key!My father will richly reward you if you can save me!9668A Hand of Argus soldier is many things: Obedient, brave, intelligent, and above all, honorable. You may yet exhibit some of these traits, .Report to Exarch Admetius at Blood Watch if you are still interested in joining the Hand. He and his subordinates will further train you in the ways of the draenei soldier.And remember this, : Honorable people do not always perform honorably. Sometimes they cannot.You will find Blood Watch just up this road, to the north.9669About a week ago, my research team and I were out exploring the western wilds of Bloodmyst when we were attacked by bloodthirsty spiders. The effect of the crystal contamination was clearly evident as these spiders were massive and extremely aggressive.I managed to escape but my team wasn't so lucky. We must not let the same fate befall others. Go west to the Amberweb Pass and destroy the spiders and their matriarch, Zarakh.9670It was a bloody mess, . We were ambushed by a large pack of these spiders. Their progenitor descended upon us with incredible speed and wrapped us up in cocoons.After we were webbed, she began to lay eggs near us. We were to be food for her young! FOOD!I managed to cut my way out and escape but I will not leave the others behind. So far I've been unsuccessful in nearing the pass. Would you lend a hand?Destroy those cocoons! Hopefully some of our team is still alive!96719672Dear friend,My hand trembles as I ink this letter. I pray that it reaches you in time.Last night, Edward Hanes, captain of the ship 'Lost Hope', appeared before me in my tent. The same Edward Hanes that died of scurvy 20 years ago.This apparition told me a tale that made my heart tremble. A tale that I need you to hear and a mission that I need you to accomplish. Will you do it? Will you seek out Edward on Wyrmscar Island, northeast of your base?Regards,Admiral Odesyus9674They say when the world was sundered, this land cried the loudest. It was here that thousands of night elves faded into oblivion and in their place rose terrible creatures of hate - the naga.Obedient to their twisted queen, Azshara, they would destroy all that would dare pass through their sea. It would remain this way for thousands of years - until now.The first order of business is to remove the bloodcursed naga from the reef.9676As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young paladins here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Jesthenis Sunstriker. Speak with Jesthenis and see what training he has available for you.  The things he will teach do have a cost, so bring some coin with you.Your trainer - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.9680Kamsis was right!  This information is extremely important.If Medivh weaved his own essence into the magic he used to defeat the dragon, it is quite possible we could retrieve even a faint residue of that essence from the dragon's remains.  What great insight may lie beneath the ashes of Deadwind Pass, awaiting discovery.Go to the mountains south of Karazhan and bring me back a bone fragment of seemingly draconic origin.9682On a ledge of the reef, deeper than where you found the bloodcursed naga, you will find the hopeless ones: The bloodcursed voyagers, ghosts of those taken by the bloodcurse.It is regrettable, what I ask of you now... but they must be destroyed and their cursed shells brought back to me.Their souls must be put to rest. Return to me when you have done as asked and I shall give you one final task.9683To the south you will find Bloodcurse Isle. Atop the island you will find a shrine dedicated to the beloved queen of the naga, Azshara. Destroy the statue - burn it in effigy! This will surely draw the ire of Atoph, the Bloodcursed leader.Slay Atoph and return to me!9687Not long ago, the once tranquil owlkin of the region appeared on the shores of this island. One by one they would come to steal the bones of the fallen dragons. I do not know what would cause these creatures such distress or why they would want the bones of the deceased, but the spirits of the brood have grown restless due to this sacrilege.To the west, across the Crimson Reach, you will find Ragefeather Ridge. Venture to the owlkin encampments and recover the pilfered dragon bones.9688The whelps that you see on this island are the agitated spirits of the green dragonflight. Like me, they are bound to the land, unable to ascend to their final resting place in the Dream.Recovering the bones of the fallen has settled them somewhat but you must take further action.Destroy their ethereal manifestations. I cannot leave this place until it is done. They must be released!9689Many of the black dragonflight were slain during the attacks. One of them, a lieutenant of Deathwing himself, still haunts this place. If you look to the heavens, you can see his spectral countenance circling the skies. His hatred is so great that he remains even in death.Take the bones that you gathered for me earlier to the top of the mountain on this island and place them in the ever-burning pyre. This act should signal Razormaw to descend. When he does, slay his undead form.9693What does Argus mean to you, ? Many draenei probably do not know or remember our home planet. It is there that we split from the man'ari: the twisted demonic reflections of ourselves that were 'gifted' by Sargeras. Or as they call themselves, eredar.Eredar... this word once held meaning.Disgusting.Let us not waste anymore time. Find Vindicator Boros to begin your training.9694Blood Watch is one of two forward bases operated by the Hand of Argus. You have already been to the other base, Azure Watch; things are completely different in Bloodmyst. When we first got here, the land was as beautiful as Azuremyst. We even called it Silvergale but now sickness is spreading across the land, worse yet, the blood elves that we were battling on the Exodar survived the crash. This brings me to your assignment: Venture northwest into Bladewood and terminate any blood elves that you find.9696Our chief interrogator, Elysia, is fluent in Thalassian. Take the document to her and see what she has to say.9697There's important research to be conducted into the ecology of the local creatures, especially the sporelings and bog lords of the marsh.  And trust me, once you get out into the field, you'll find the work to be challenging.Seek out Watcher Leesa'oh at the Cenarion Watchpost in the western region of the marsh toward the south.  Follow the path west and you will eventually find her.  She can be a bit -- studious -- but don't let that get to you.Oh, and watch out for her cat.9698I need you to deliver the translated documents to Velen personally, . I don't trust that deranged messenger.Explain to the Prophet that the blood elves are receiving reinforcements from the Outland and that they have a spy amongst the draenei at the Exodar. Velen resides in the Vault of Lights inside the Exodar.Make haste!9699I thank you for the timely delivery, . You are turning out to be one of the Hand's better agents.If only we knew who they reported to in Bloodmyst and more importantly, where this sun portal was... They seem to have it tightly guarded - wherever it may be.Would you be interested in some reconnaissance work?If so, take these orders back to Vindicator Boros. He will give you your next mission.9700Velen states that if the blood elves have been opening rifts between this island and the Outland, there will be residue or anomalies left in the areas where the portals have been opened. You must search the island for locations that exhibit or display these anomalies.Be warned, ; some of these anomalies will be creatures from the void itself. Should you find void anomalies, slay them! Report back to me with any new information that you may find. Begin your search to the north, near the Warp Piston.9701We need to learn all that we can of the sporelings at Sporeggar and their relationship to the creatures around them.  One way to do that is what I'm doing; passive observation while making a note of their interactions.I need you to head over to the Spawning Glen to the west.  Investigate the whole area and then return to tell me what you saw.9702I was wondering why the bog lords were crossing the road to go to the Spawning Glen - they must be starving for some reason.  This just will not do!I mean, normally I wouldn't get involved, but if they continue to eat all of the sporeling pods they'll wipe them out!Here's what we'll do: I'll stay here and you head to the Quagg Ridge to the east and look for dietary clues as to why they're raiding the sporelings.9703We have others pursuing leads on the sun portals, . I need you to focus on the task at hand.Boros has received new reports of another crash site. What we've since discovered is that the crash site is actually the Exodar's cryo-core. This is a pod holding area that houses pods exactly like the ones we draenei crawled out of in Ammen Vale.This area also holds medical supplies. Head to the Cryo-Core, directly west of Blood Watch. Search for supplies and search for survivors.9704It's hard work being an outrunner between Sunstrider Isle and Falconwing Square.  Tight deadlines, long hours and worst of all... the Wretched!The road south goes through the ruins of Silvermoon... the place is crawling with Wretched ready to kill you for a few mana crystals.  Unfortunately, I think that's what happened to the last outrunner we sent with one of Erona's packages.I see you're eager to prove yourself.  Venture into Dawning Lane and see if you can find any traces of our outrunner.9705You take the package and confirm that indeed it comes from Magistrix Erona.  Alarion would probably want you to bring it to her.9706Your hands tremble as you pick up the book. Kuros must be told about this tragedy. Return the book to him.9708Yes, that's it, I knew I had seen this particular phylum of mushroom elsewhere in the marsh!To the north is a place known as the Hewn Bog.  Odd name for the place if you ask me, but I've never been there.  I'll need samples of those mushrooms to confirm my hypothesis.Just be careful, .  I'd heard that ogres have moved in to the area, so you'll have to get the samples from them.  Could that be why the bog lords are no longer going there for their food?9709, I've got an idea.   I want you to head north again, this time into the heart of ogre territory!Northwest of the Hewn Bog there is a place named Ango'rosh Stronghold, which sits on a floating island across a large mushroom bridge.The ogres must be storing the harvested mushrooms there.  I bet you'll find them all over the place, and probably on the ogres themselves, too!Bring me a sufficient number and I will try to do something about providing the bog lords with a new source of nourishment.9711Matis will be brought to justice, ; and I want you to be the one to find him and bring him back to the Triumvirate.Scour the island for this killer. Should you find him, use this flare gun. When my trackers see the flare, they'll come and assist in capturing Matis. Return to me after he's been captured.9716We came to Outland expecting to find small pockets of life.  What we discovered in Zangarmarsh was a lush environment with a thriving ecosystem.Our initial assessment of the area was deceiving, however.  The water levels at the lakes and marshes have consistently been going down since we started taking measurements.The impact this could have on the local animal and plant life is disastrous.  Go to Umbrafen Lake, southwest of here, and look for clues related to this water depletion.9718We must determine how widespread the naga's activity truly is and react accordingly.Exploring each body of water in Zangarmarsh could be a lengthy undertaking.  If you allow me to, I will use my magic to mold your shape to one more suited to scouting the marsh.Hold this amulet above the balcony near me when you're ready to begin.  I will guide your way back to safety after we're done.9720I cannot begin to comprehend why the naga would drain the water out of their own habitat.  What I do understand is a need to put a stop to their operations.These seeds carry with them the rage of the earth.  Take them to the steam pumps operated by the naga and use them on their controls.The vines that grow from the seeds will be as thick as your arm and as strong as iron.  Go, .  Restore the balance that the naga have upset.9724The Cenarion Expedition has become a large organization with a good degree of autonomy.  These events are important enough that we need to warn the Cenarion Circle.Do not worry, I will not ask you to travel back to Moonglade; we have emissaries as nearby as Hellfire Peninsula.9726The naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast have begun to kill our people.  We cannot allow this to continue, !We suggest that you teach them a lesson as proof of our friendship.9727Reports have come in that the naga of the Bloodscale Enclave to the northeast continue to kill our people.  We thought that you had dealt with this, !I suggest that you to teach them a lesson as proof of our continued friendship.9728While the druids from the expedition have made themselves busy studying plants and researching the lakes, I've made it my business to deal with the hostiles in the area.Ever since we set foot in Zangarmarsh, the naga have launched lethal attacks against us without warning.  We've done our best to keep them at bay, but our resources are limited.I want you to go to the various naga strongholds in Zangarmarsh and show them that we're not to be crossed.  Bring me their claws as proof of your victories.9729Little naga make Fhwoor angry!  Sporelings good friend to Fhwoor, so Fhwoor get naga ark.We go into nearby naga village. You help?9730A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajah Haghazed, leader of the Darkcrest naga.  Haghazed was last sighted by Cenarion scouts at the Lagoon, in the central southern region of Zangarmarsh.The Darkcrest have been linked to numerous attacks against the Cenarion Expedition and their leader is considered extremely dangerous.Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot.9731The schematics you've obtained show an underground system of drains and pumps that connect the lakes in the region to Serpent Lake.If the schematics are correct, there is a giant drain in the center of Serpent Lake.  Confirm this and bring the news to Cenarion Refuge.9732Return to Ysiel and let her know that help will be extended to her as soon as it is possible.Affairs in Moonglade and Silithus have kept our members occupied, but we will do our best to send the necessary resources to the Cenarion Refuge.9739You there!  You must help us!The fungal giants are devouring all of our spore sacs!  You must do something, or we'll lose our young!The spore sacs start out large and become smaller as the air inside them is depleted.  Look for the small, mature spore sacs and save as many of them as you can!9740Thanks to you and the work you did, my scouts were able to find the sun gate. The elves keep the portal location mobile so that they can move it at a moment's notice. That's why the site you investigated was empty.The strength of such a system is also its greatest weakness. The sun gate is stabilized by portal controllers. If we can take down the controllers, the portal will be ours to destroy. The current sun gate location can be found west of here, south of the Vector Coil. Find it and destroy it!9741Aesom sent my squad out on a reconnaissance mission to search for the sun gate a few days ago. Needless to say, we found it...Whatever those fool elves are transporting through that portal is causing void energy to be released. The area is teaming with void critters. We must destroy them before they have a chance to grow into void anomalies. You'll find the source of the creatures southwest of here, near the sun gate. Kill them and report back to Aesom when you're done.97429743Us sporelings and the bog lords have never gotten along well.  In the past, we've managed to keep them at bay with spears and stones.  Lately they seem to have become more aggressive... or more desperate.  They do not fear us or our weapons.You are much scarier and better armed than us.  If you were to fight the boglords for us, we'd be forever in your debt!  Bring me their tendrils so I know how many you've killed.97449746Victory is close at hand, . With the discovery of the sun gate, it won't be long until their supply lines are completely closed off. Now is the time to strike at their numbers.To the west you will find numerous Sunhawk camps. The Sunhawk pyromancers and defenders occupy the vast majority of the area. Find them, kill them and return to me.9747The naga are terrible, yes.  But even more terrible are the traitor tribes of Broken and Lost Ones that helped them!The worst of all are the Lost Ones of the Umbrafen tribe; they use dark magic to trap and enslave others. They're especially cruel to escaped slaves and would slit my throat if I left the refuge even for a day.Travel to Umbrafen Village south of here and kill them and their leader, Kataru.  Until then I will fear for my life every single day.9748Our shaman claim that the elements of water have become greatly agitated by the pollution of the water source. We know that the Exodar's power core is lodged into the mountain to the west. It must be leaking volatile fluids into the water supply! I need you to get me more information.You are to take this flask and follow the beach north until you reach the area where the rivers of Bloodmyst drain into the ocean. Take a sample from that location and return to me.9752You must help me get out of here!I was gathering herbs nearby when a handful of these little savages abducted me.  I tried to fight them off, but there were too many of them.Help me return to the Cenarion Refuge and away from these cruel wretches and their vile magic!9753We've learned much of our enemies in recent days. The blood elves are led by a being known as Sironas and plot to destroy us. Ultimately, they seek to enslave O'ros and regain control of the Exodar.Light be praised, we have stopped their supply line by destroying the sun gate. Unfortunately, they continue to use the contaminant of the Vector Coil to poison the land, using the mutagenic properties of the fallout to their advantage.With this knowledge, Admetius has devised a plan. Seek him out.9756Our attempts at interrogation have failed miserably, . Torture is - of course - out of the question. What we need is a  on the inside.I can cast a spell upon you that would make you appear blood elf and adjust your language. Through subterfuge, we may be able to get the information we need out of the captured agent.Under this guise, I want you to get whatever information you can out of the prisoner.And , do not leave Blood Watch while disguised as the spell will fail.9758Now my friend, if you would be so kind as to return to Arcanist Vandril, I know that he is very anxious to send you out on your first mission here in the Ghostlands.We're counting on you, .  Don't let us down.9759Don't accept this assignment if you value your life. You see that gigantic power core jutting out of the mountain side over yonder? Whoever takes on this burden will need to fight their way through that mountain, battling an army of Sunhawks while protecting me as I rig the core up for demolition. Sironas the eredar is somewhere up there as well.I won't think less of you if you just walk away, .But maybe you're the one - the one to destroy the Vector Coil and take down Sironas. Well, are you?9760I would not ask you to single-handedly bear the burden of destroying the Vector Coil and slaying Sironas, ; however, I believe that you can be of some help in clearing the way for others that might take on such a dangerous assignment.Take the road going north out of Blood Watch and follow it until you get to the fork. Once there, take the left road and follow it until you see Vindicator's Rest - it will be slightly west of the road itself. Corin will be waiting for you.9761Only the most battle hardened, noble and positively fearless will submit to Legoso's mission. The exarch will not order any agent of the Hand to take on the task of destroying the Vector Coil and dispatching Sironas. He refuses to send any draenei to their death - which is what the mission is: suicide...My job is to soften up the Sunhawk defenses. You are to slay Sunhawks near the Vector Coil and keep the path clear for our champion - whoever that may be.97629769I bet if they knew they were wearing bug parts, the fashion trend would end very quickly.We first started killing the bugs 'round here 'cause they were getting in the way of our construction. Some enterprising merchant stops here, spends the night, and next thing you know he's buyin' up all the bug wings we have!Says he makes clothes out of 'em. I be stickin' to my armor, thanks. But if you gather the wings of any of the fireflies, I'll gladly buy 'em.9770Sometimes I wish Denjai had sent a shaman with us, or at least given us a totem to keep the marshfang rippers at bay.The whole place is crawling with the pests! It's just not right. Shouldn't something be eating these despicable things?We've all been taking turns playing exterminator. You showed up at just the right time, . Congratulations! Now get out there and mop up some marshfangs!9771Now that you're familiar with the terrain, I'd like to ask your help with something else. The Dead Mire, we've taken to calling the area to the northwest, is an eerie place. No one has ever reported seeing anything alive there, but they didn't stay for very long, either.Scout Jyoba volunteered to investigate the area and report on his findings. He left the post three days ago and hasn't returned. It's not like him to be gone that long without sending some kind of report. Will you search for him, ?9772Flecks of withered fungus dot the body of Scout Jyoba. Whatever killed him must've been made of the same dying fungus as the giant wilting mushrooms of the Dead Mire. Perhaps one of the withered giants caught him by surprise as he sat writing his report.Without the text of the report, it's nearly impossible to tell what the scout discovered. If the report can be found, it should be returned to Zurai.9773Mushroom soup, mushroom stew, mushroom sauce!Mushroom, mushroom, mushroom! It's all there is to eat around here. If you say you're hungry, the cook hands you an axe and tells you to go chop down your dinner!Well, I'm tired of mushrooms. I've seen fish in the lakes around here. Sure, they look like a nasty piece of work, but they've got to be better than mushrooms!How much will it cost me to hire you to bring me my first decent meal in weeks?9774Reavij was wise to bring leather armor. This swamp will render my mail useless before long.I've been replacing the scales bit by bit as I'm able. The hydra in the marsh have thick, protective scales that stand up well to the dampness of their home.Finding suitable ones is a tedious process, though. All too often, the best scales are torn or worn too thin for use in armor. Bring me any good ones that you might get from the hydra in the larger lakes.9775Shadow Hunter Denjai will no doubt expect to receive a report about my progress in establishing our outpost. I've prepared a short summary of what we've accomplished here already, but with the loss of Scout Jyoba, I can't spare a runner to take the report to Denjai's base of Zabra'jin to the west.If you're headed that way, would you mind bringing this to him? Shadow Hunter Denjai can be a little intimidating at first, but once you get used to him, he's not so bad.9776As you know, many of Telredor's inhabitants are refugees from the war that decimated the draenei. It is my goal to maintain Telredor as a safe haven for all of our allies in this struggle. There are some who desire to join us, but feel they are not yet ready.We owe them whatever help we can provide, . A group of Broken under the leadership of Ikuti have taken shelter in the ruins of an old temple to the northwest of Serpent Lake. Seek them out and extend your hand in friendship to them.9777There is little in this swamp that will burn, , so we must resort to other means for lighting Telredor. Many of the creatures and plants in the marsh emit a soft glow.It's difficult and cruel to confine the glowing creatures, so we've turned to a species of mushroom for our light source.We pick and cultivate the fulgor mushroom here, but our needs require us to gather new crops occasionally. The small green mushrooms often grow at the base of larger ones near Telredor.9778Before you leave Cenarion Refuge, make sure you speak with Warden Hamoot.  He's in charge of the expedition's security.He would never forgive me if I didn't send a seasoned adventurer like you his way.9779It is good to see you again, . I have a quandary that you might be able to solve.Our agents situated behind Sunhawk lines have reported seeing Sunhawk soldiers parsing an unusual document.Unfortunately, we have been unsuccessful in acquiring a copy of the document for ourselves. I need you to go out in the field and try to recover the document. I am certain that if you apply enough pressure, a Sunhawk agent will turn over the information we seek. I leave the use of force to your discretion.9780It's good to see another fresh face here. When Haalrun and I first came to Telredor, we were the only outsiders, but that seems like a lifetime ago.Still, we try to welcome newcomers and ensure that there's always enough food and supplies. We can never fully repay the kindness of the Telredor anchorites, but we can follow their example and extend it to others.If you would like to help, the nearby lakes are populated with a fish called the Umbrafen eel, whose meat is a staple of our diet.9781On my last hunting trip, I caught sight of a new outpost being built by a group of trolls. No doubt they've begun hunting these lands, too.If they establish a permanent presence out here, the competition for food will be fierce. We cannot take direct action against them without provocation, but we can remove some of the natural competition for food.For each mire hydra you kill, that's three fewer mouths to feed!9782I have lived among the anchorites of Telredor for some time, , and in that time I've come to know the marsh quite well. Recently, I've started to notice a disturbing change in the land to the northeast.Virtually all life there has begun to wither and die, seemingly without explanation. I have a few ideas as to what might be happening, but they are little more than speculation. If you were to bring me a sample of the soil in that area, I may be able to get to the bottom of this mystery.9783The soil sample you brought me is nearly devoid of moisture, . If the soil itself is losing moisture, then the creatures that live in the Dead Mire must be suffering terribly.I've seen what happens when the region's fungal giants begin to wither and die. The pain drives them mad, causing them to attack anything in their path.These creatures have no idea what's happening to them. They're beyond our ability to save, so the best we can do is to end their suffering.97849785You've earned the trust of the Cenarion Expedition, .  It is time you spoke to the ancients allied with our cause, Ashyen and Keleth, and asked for their blessing.Carrying the mark of an ancient will fill you with great power.  These boons will become more powerful as your renown among us increases.Go, , and ask the ancients for their blessing.9786Before my people were decimated by the orcs, Telredor served as a retreat for draenei anchorites and spiritualists. A small order of anchorites and vindicators maintained a number of shrines in this region.During the war, we lost contact with the anchorites assigned to the shrines, particularly the Boha'mu temple to the southwest. I've heard reports that a tribe of Lost Ones has settled in the area and may even be using the ruins. Visit the Boha'mu Ruins and tell me of what you find there.9787From what you've told me about your observations at the Boha'mu Ruins, it seems this tribe of Lost Ones has reverted to the worship of animal spirits. Before we can approach them, we must know more of their beliefs.Return to Feralfen Village and discreetly gather some of their idols so that I may study them. Try to avoid angering them, , as it may hurt our chances of making contact with them.9788Soon after I escaped the Umbrafen tribe, I holed up in a cave south of their village.  Little did I know that the cave was being fought over by marsh beasts and spore men!I had to leave in a hurry and left behind a box containing my only worldly possessions.After managing to sneak out of Umbrafen with my belongings it was terrible irony that I would lose them so soon after.  If you're willing to bring them back to me I'll give you one of my very own personal items.  What do you say, ?9789You want to earn a place in this safari?  You'll have to prove yourself.I don't care what you've hunted before, you haven't hunted until you hunt what we hunt here.  Start with the clefthoof if you're  enough.I know that I've seen them in the immediate area around the safari and also close by to the south.9790Living in such a remote location has taught us to make use of everything available. Of course, you have to learn to stop thinking about where some of these materials come from first.I've found that the wings of the umbraglow stingers are very helpful for waterproofing. They're strong, thin, and flexible.I see the look on your face. Like I said, it takes time to get used to the idea. If you're going to be out and about, would you mind bringing me some of the wings?9791During the orcs' war against my people, gatherers rarely left Telredor for fear of being attacked or captured. Now, we venture out more often, but the marsh is no less perilous.It seems that the nether rays have grown bolder in recent months. I don't know if it has something to do with more competition for their normal prey, but they've been attacking our foraging parties on a regular basis. If we can thin their ranks in the area around Telredor, perhaps they would learn to leave us alone.9792You've been honorable in our dealings, , at a time when trust is hard to win among my people.A large group of my brethren have made their home in the old draenei city of Telaar in Nagrand, to the south. To reach Telaar, take the road south into Nagrand, then continue southeast until you find yourself in the cliffs east of Oshu'gun.Anyone who has aided us, as you have, would be welcome among the people of Telaar.Seek out Warden Moi'bff Jill and tell him you have earned my trust.9793Prophet Velen's search for allies has emboldened those draenei remaining in Outland to begin a search of their own. The Legion's war on my people drove us from our cities and temples, but they have not destroyed the traces of our civilization.Tuurem, my former home in the Terokkar Forest, was one of the first cities overrun by the orcs. It's been too long since I've received news of its status. Take this letter to Andarl in the Allerian Stronghold within Terokkar and see what you can find out.9794, I have a favor to ask of you. Normally, I would do this myself, but my hands are already beyond full.I have an associate named Kialon at Sylvanaar in the Blade's Edge Mountains to the north. He's expecting to hear from me in the near future, although I suspect he won't like what I have to say.If you would deliver my response to him, you would have my gratitude. I must insist, and this is very important, that you not attempt to read the letter. It is for Kialon's eyes alone.9795As if the naga and their allies weren't enough, the ogres are extending their reach in the marsh. They've already conquered most of the area to the northwest and there isn't much of a buffer left.For each one we kill, several more take their place. I'm not sure how long we'll be able to hold Zabra'jin once they decide to attack. Make your way north into the mountains, to the orcish stronghold of Thunderlord Stronghold and let Nekthar know of our plight. Any help he can spare would be most welcome.9796Shadow Hunter Denjai isn't the only one expecting a report from me. Mokasa at Stonebreaker Hold in Terokkar is eager to hear of our progress, especially since most of her messengers travel through here.She asked me to send word once Swamprat Post was completed. If you wouldn't mind delivering the news, I'd be very grateful. We may be up and running, but there is still much to be done.To get to Stonebreaker Hold, follow the road south out of Zangarmarsh, into Terokkar Forest and beyond Tuurem.9797They may not survive, ! Get to Garadar as quickly as your legs will carry you.The home of the Mag'har, lies to the south, in Nagrand. Take the southern road out of the marsh, then turn east at the first fork and look for a large settlement on the lake.Find our commander, Captain Kroghan, there and offer him what assistance you can. Garadar must not fall!9798These plans seem important.  You should take them to Vindicator Aldar at the crash site.9799The Ammen Fields to the west are the primary breeding ground of the local lasher population. With the corruption of the water table from the nearby lake, Botanist Taerix is worried that the lashers will not be able to repopulate themselves once we've cleansed the lake.Go to the Ammen Fields and pick some of the corrupted flowers for me so that I might take a look at them and see what can be done. You should be able to identify them by their uncharacteristic red petals.9800You are ill-equipped to face the restless elements of Nagrand. Before you can help the Earthen Ring, you must help yourself.To the west you will find dung heaps left behind by the wildlife of Nagrand. You must search the dung for the digested remnants of the Nagrand caracoli. From this bean I am able to make a tablet that will aid you in your battle against the restless forces of nature.Return to me when you have collected no less than two fists worth of caracoli... Ogre sized fists.9801I have a feeling that these Lost Ones may not respond well to a draenei, but would welcome an arakkoa. I can create a potion that will allow you to take on the form of an arakkoa for a short time. It requires a couple of reagents which cannot be stored and must be used within hours of being gathered.You will need to bring me a handful of sporebat eyes and some fen strider tentacles. Both species dwell in the wilderness surrounding Telredor.9802The lakes of Zangarmarsh are slowly being drained of their water.  We don't quite know why, but we do know that many plants species are in danger of becoming extinct.As the expedition's cataloguer, it is my job to track and identify these plants so we can better understand what's happening to them.If you'd like to help, bring me unidentified plant parts.  They can be picked right from the ground if you're an herbalist, and the indigenous creatures of the swamp may also carry plant parts on them.9803The time has come for us to embrace the Feralfen and teach them that the Light has not forsaken them. Take the potion I've prepared and carry it with you to the Boha'mu Ruins.Once you arrive at the ruins, drink the potion to assume the form of one of their bird spirits. Speak with Elder Kuruti and let him know the draenei are ready to welcome his people as our long lost brothers.9804The disturbance in the ebb and flow of the waters of Nagrand has greatly agitated the water spirits of Skysong Lake. They have in turn begun sowing destruction throughout the waterways of the area.Watoosun of the Water has come to us in a vision and granted us permission to remedy the problem - so long as the source of the disturbance is also dealt with...We will get to the source, but first you must deal with the problems immediate to the Throne. Destroy the agitated lake spirits and return to me.9805The wretched Lost Ones, heretofore banished to the swamps of Zangarmarsh, are seeking to spread their filth to other parts of our world.I have sought the wisdom of the furies and gained their blessing. To stop the source, we must unleash the elements upon them!I give you living fire, plucked from the fiery essence of Incineratus himself. Travel to Windyreed Village, southeast of here, and unleash the living fire upon their huts! Let them see the fury of the elements!9806Spore bats and marsh walkers accumulate fertile spores on their appendages from wandering around the tallstalk mushrooms in the marsh.As you can see, we're a short people so our options for gathering these spores are limited.  Seek out the spore bats and marsh walkers and gather the fertile spores.  All of Sporeggar will be in your debt.98079808I've seen your kind use shiny round pieces of metal to trade for things that you need.  We're not so different from you.  We use shiny round mushrooms as our currency.Glowcap mushrooms grow everywhere in the marsh, you just have to know how to pick them from the ground without wrecking them.  I'll teach you how to do it, if you promise to bring us some for our reserves.  What do you say, ?98099810Watoosun was able to shed the stink of corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. A spirit essence composed of the vilest corruption found amongst the elements!You will find this polluted spirit of the swamp southwest of here, hidden in the depths of Lake Sunspring.Find and destroy the polluted essence of Watoosun and any corrupt offspring that it may have created.9811This is the beginning of a new chapter in blood elf history, .  You've helped cement the bond between my race and yours, .Take the traitor's head to Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron in Silvermoon City.  He'll be eager to hear the news.9812There were doubts about our capabilities among our potential new allies.  Of what use could we be to them when perceived as unable to deal with our problems at home?This changes everything.  No longer will our power be questioned.  We'll be able to join the Horde as equals.Take this letter to Sylvanas, ruler of the Forsaken.  She's already on our side but the news of Dar'Khan's death will be music to her ears.  Prepare for a long trip, .  If all goes well she will send you to Orgrimmar.9813I haven't lost any love for my homeland or its people, as you know.  I've fought tooth and nail for Silvermoon to be allowed a place beside Undercity and Orgrimmar at the negotiating table.This should silence any opposition. Take this letter to the Warchief in Orgrimmar.  As leader of the Horde he will have the final say on accepting the sin'dorei's pledge.I've added my own seal to the letter as a personal endorsement.  Go northwest of the city and board the zeppelin bound for Durotar at the tower.9814You like mushrooms, mon? There be a powerful one here in Zangarmarsh, growin' real close to Zabra'jin.You gotta be careful, though, mon. They be callin' it the burstcap for a reason. If you be gettin' too close without takin' the proper precautions, it'll blow right up on you! Poof! Right into a cloud o' toxic spores.I been usin' them for readin' the omens, but they be almost gone now.9815The most affected elements of water can be found in the Halaani Basin, southwest of here, beneath the abandoned city of Halaa. While some distressed elements can be destroyed without any impact upon the environment, spawns of muck must be physically removed from the world once destroyed.You see, muck spawns leave behind globules of tainted debris that if left untouched will spread and further contaminate the environment.Destroy these muck spawns and bring back their muck-ridden cores.9816This marsh be missin' one thing, mon! There be no murlocs here.Don't worry, mon, I got a plan to fix the problem. See Gargle 'n' Gurgle over there? I plan to give the gift o' murlocs to the Lost Ones!Take this cage with you to Daggerfen Village an' release 'em in the northeastern cluster of huts. Now you know I can't be riskin' Gargle 'n' Gurgle with you, but I'll give you a cage full o' colorful young murlocs. Just set it on the flat rock you be findin' up there and open the door!9817A bounty is hereby declared by the Cenarion Expedition on Rajis Fyashe, leader of the Bloodscale naga.  The naga sorceress was last sighted at Serpent Lake, in the northern region of Zangarmarsh.The Bloodscale are to be considered extremely dangerous and their leader is to be approached with extreme caution.Those seeking to claim the bounty are advised to report to Warden Hamoot at Cenarion Refuge.9818Something rails the underneath. It beats the ground as if to punish.*Thud*It makes this sound a hundred-thousand times. Endlessly it beats. The earth reels. It is calling out to us now.Gordawg speaks to me.

Unless he is stopped, he and his band will cut a path to the walls of Zabra'jin. who presents the head of Boss Grog'ak to Shadow Hunter Denjai shall be well-rewarded.9821Gordawg tastes. Gordawg knows where this earth has been.Look. See Nagrand.BREAK THEM! Bring Gordawg the pieces to eat.Take the map.9822The position of the ogres' mushroom-cutting operation can't be an accident. I can't escape the suspicion that they're preparing for an attack on Zabra'jin.I must know for certain, . The ogres have another outpost to the northwest, the Ango'rosh Grounds. If they're staging for an attack, there will be evidence of their plans there. Go there,  and search the camp for signs of their intentions. Return to me with anything that might be suspicious.9823In order to end the Ango'rosh threat, we must kill their leader, Overlord Gorefist. We'll do better than that, though. We'll make an example of the overlord and his followers.Go to the Ango'rosh Stronghold and deal with our foes. The stronghold is located in a cave on a small island to the northwest of Zabra'jin. You'll see a bridge made from a fallen mushroom beyond the Ango'rosh Camp.Show no mercy, . They certainly wouldn't spare any of us.9824I'm trying to obtain an imprint of Karazhan's energy... for a personal project, of course.  Unfortunately, I'm not getting anything up here.  If I could get near an underground water source, my crystal would pick up the signals much more clearly.I've heard of an underground pond as well as a well in a cellar below us.  This whole place is crawling with ghosts however, and venturing there would be hazardous for someone my age.  What do you say; will you help an old man and perform the scrying for me?9825As you may have noticed, the outside of Karazhan is crawling with ghostly beings. The reason for their existence is unknown and unknowns bother me!Bring me their ghostly essence so that I may study their nature.  Karazhan has many secrets, .  I'm determined to uncover all of them.9826These signs do not bode well for us, .  I've never been one for secrecy so I will tell you a bit about my organization, the Violet Eye.We are agents of the Kirin Tor, the Magus Senate of Dalaran.  We were assigned to keep an eye on Karazhan and Medivh, in case things got out of hand.Which they did... very quickly, after Medivh disappeared.This report details my findings.  Take it to Archmage Cedric, also from the Violet Eye; you will find him in the outskirts of Dalaran Crater.9827A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something. The alien mass of fungus presents something of a puzzle. It's far from healthy, but you have little clue as to what function it might normally perform.Perhaps someone more familiar with the denizens of Zangarmarsh would be able to tell you more about the basidium.9828A close inspection of the basidium reveals a number of indentations that might have once held something.

We thought it was bad when Karazhan sealed itself off to the outside world.  We had agents inside; we never heard from any of them again.  Now this... demonic emanation.  We must investigate it.The only people who can reopen Karazhan were presumed dead: Khadgar and Medivh.While we hope that the latter is indeed gone, we recently learned that his apprentice, Khadgar, is alive and well in a place called Shattrath City.  Find him and give him Alturus's report.9830When I speak to draenei, I often get the sense that they consider themselves removed from their environment. Many seem to pity my brethren, the Broken, who they say have lost something.We Broken may have lost our inclination toward the Light, but our experiences have brought us closer to the land.My people see opportunities where few draenei do. Take, for example, the venom of the marshlight bleeders that live to the south and west. It has a wide variety of uses from hunting to healing.9831I am deeply troubled by the news in this report, .  Gaining entry into Karazhan will be difficult, however.You see, when it became apparent that I was stranded here I split the key into three fragments.I placed the keys inside enchanted containers, and in turn placed those in places that were safe at the time.With the dark changes Outland has endured this no longer is the case.  The first fragment is in a section of Auchindoun taken over by the Shadow Council.  Return this fragment to me.9832I hid the second fragment at the bottom of Serpent Lake, long before it was called that.  The giant drain installed there after the naga took over has likely pulled the container into the depths of Coilfang Reservoir.The third fragment will prove the most trying, as I left it inside Tempest Keep back when it was controlled by the naaru.  Kael'thas now rules it and the chamber where I left it has become a prison.Bring me these remaining fragments, .  Much depends on your success.9833One of the reasons Ikuti led us to Zangarmarsh was to help open the lines of communication between the draenei and the Kurenai home city of Telaar in Nagrand. In order for messengers to pass swiftly between Telaar and Telredor, the roads must be secured.On our way here, we were attacked repeatedly by marshfang slicers. We were able to fight them off, but they would pose a formidable threat to a solitary messenger. Reducing their numbers will help ensure the safety of our messengers.9834Maktu can always see a draenei approaching in his shiny armor from a mile away, even in this murky swamp!Maktu wants to laugh at them, but then he remembers that they have been kind to the Kurenai and he wants to teach them about how Kurenai make armor.The dark, scaly hides of the fenclaw thrashers make some of the best armor Maktu has ever worn. If  can bring Maktu some of these hides from the fenclaw thrashers deep in Serpent Lake, he'll be happy to share some of his armor.9835The small band of Broken you see here is a mission from a larger settlement in Nagrand. The Kurenai, as we call ourselves, are Broken who desire to reunite with our draenei brothers.My group has come here to strengthen Kurenai ties to the draenei of Telredor.If the Ango'rosh ogres have their way, this temple will not stand much longer. They have cleared the Hewn Bog of its towering mushrooms and draw ever closer to our refuge. If you would call yourself our friend, aid us in fighting this enemy.9836I've put together the very key I used as an apprentice.  It looks completely functional as far as keys go.  In regards to opening Karazhan, however, this might as well be a piece of scrap metal.Without Medivh's consent, the key is worthless.  Yes, of course I know Medivh is dead.  This merely makes things difficult, not impossible.There is a place in Azeroth called the Caverns of Time, guarded by the bronze dragonflight.  Find a way inside, travel back in time and get Medivh to enable the key.9837I seem to have memories about future events surrounding you and this key.You have trying times ahead of you, .  Let us hope your strength does not fail you.Regarding the key, I am to hand it to Khadgar when he's sent to me.  I couldn't hope for a better apprentice.I suppose you will need a key of your own.Go on then.  And best of luck, .9838A great responsibility has been bestowed upon you, .  If the signs that the Violet Eye has observed are to be trusted, then you must help them.For all my disagreements with Cedric, the work that men like Alturus do is still important.  Beware that they do not use you, however.  Remember it is you who the key is bound to, not them.  But if the danger in Karazhan is real, then it is they who are best prepared to guide you in dealing with it.  Go back to Alturus and help him in any way that you can.9839The centerpiece of any ogre tribe is its leader. Without leadership, the Ango'rosh's organization will disappear and they'll resort to infighting to determine who will lead next.Although we've seen the ogres out and about in this area, their true strength is concentrated in their Ango'rosh Stronghold to the northwest. It's located in a cave on a small island connected to the marsh by a fallen mushroom.Go there and defeat Overlord Gorefist. That should provide us with a well-deserved respite.9840Now that we've found a way back into Medivh's Tower - or rather you have - the first thing we need to do is try to get a sense of what the situation inside is.One of our agents who had managed to infiltrate Karazhan kept an encoded log of her observations.  Unfortunately her death was confirmed shortly before Karazhan was shut down.  Koren, Karazhan's blacksmith, was under our pay.  Though not a member of the Violet Eye, he should be able to help us find Keanna's log.  Look for him inside.9841It's impossible to work with all this infernal buzzing! Do you hear it?I can't get it out of my head! I know exactly what's making the noise, too. It's those damnable marshlight bleeders! The noise always comes from the south and west of the village.They're too big to swat, crush underfoot, or wave away. The only way to stop that unholy droning is to kill them. I don't care how you do it, , just quiet them!9842The damp atmosphere of the marsh has taken a toll on my metal tools. It's made woodworking a lot more difficult than it ought to be, so I've given up on metal blades.It turns out that the marshfang slicers living to the south and west of town grow blades that are sharper than any steel I've ever owned. They're also resistant to rust and wear. It's just a little tricky to attach them to a handle, but I think I've got it figured out. I'd appreciate any blades you could bring me.9843Who did you say you were looking for again?  Keanna?I once met someone with that name.  She was staying up at the guest chambers.  I was supposed to keep that a secret now, wasn't I?Did you say you were with the Violet Eye?  No, I've never heard of them.I need to return to my work now, if you don't mind.9844Keanna's last few entries confirm our suspicions of a demonic presence inside Karazhan.She detected the arrival of a Burning Legion agent whose location she describes as coming from the top of the tower.Her entries stop there.Karazhan is a very important place, .  It is a portal into the nether, a beacon shining into other worlds.  The possible repercussions of it falling into the wrong hands are unthinkable.  This demonic intrusion must be stopped.  And you, , are the only one with a key.9845It's a relief to be in someplace with water after trekking through the wasteland of Hellfire Peninsula. I was worried there might not be any respectable fishing holes in Outland.Now I'm glad I lugged my fishing supplies along. For the most part, the fishing's been good, except for those no good fenclaw thrashers in Serpent Lake.Not only do they scare the fish away, but they're bold enough to snap the bait right off my hook. I spend more time re-baiting the hook than I do catching anything!9846The most powerful tribe of Lost Ones in the marsh, the Feralfen, are said to possess powerful medicine. There may be no truth to such rumors, but anything that might help me channel the spirits of this world cannot be ignored.Find the Feralfen mystics, hunters and druids, , and capture their totems. Everything I need to know should be apparent from the carvings.9847We must find out how much power this Feralfen snake spirit possesses and whether it can be bent to our will. Imagine what I could do with the powers of an Outland spirit at my command!Take this totem with you and make your way to the foot of the stairs leading to the Boha'mu Ruins. Plant the totem in the ground and it should do the rest. The spirit should not be able to tell who has used the totem until it has manifested.9848Bugs, bugs, bugs! The marsh is full of them and my companions here seem obsessed with them.Well, I've had it with the bugs! Something far more intriguing has captured my interest. To the west, there is a village of Lost Ones who call themselves the Daggerfen.The whole tribe consists of highly specialized assassins. I've noticed them mixing and using a particularly potent kind of poison. I'm dying to know more about the poison, but that's going to require a copy of the recipe and a sample vial.9849You are granted a piece of the fury of the earth.

Perhaps someone at the Throne of the Elements could shed some insight on this unusual find.9862Murkblood are capturing and torturing the spirits of air! Murkblood are my kin: A tribe of the Broken who serve the vile Musel'ek, beast lord of Coilfang.The air spirit states that the Murkblood putrifiers are capturing other spirits of air and using them to sow chaos into the ranks of the elements. It would seem that the Murkblood have recently sacked an orc village to the southwest known as Sunspring and are using powerful elemental magic to disturb the lake. Find the putrifiers and destroy them.9863With our leadership in ruin, we are left open to attacks from all sides. The foul Murkblood tribe could not have picked a better time to attack us!In recent days, we have been subject to no less than 5 assaults from the Broken. They have even taken over our only other territorial holding in the area: Sunspring Post.We must strike and show them that we are not powerless! Strike down the vile idolaters and bring me their twisted idols of worship so that they may ride the lightning.9864After the last Murkblood raid, a group of younglings decided to act. We tried to stop them but the rage had taken hold. It has now been one week since we last saw our beloved younglings.Please, , you must find them! They have just barely reached adolescence. How can they expect to defeat such savages?They took the road leading west out of town. Follow that road around and look for signs of our younglings.And , avoid Halaa if you value your life. It is a war-zone.9865I do not know you, stranger, but I ask for your help. I feel shame for this, but I am only one orc.Emotions have surfaced that I have never felt. I... I seek vengeance. Blood for blood. Do your people ever feel this? I wish to pick up my axe and split my enemies in two. To swing the weapon until my arms fall lifelessly at my sides, exhausted.Sunspring Post is directly south of this procession. It is there that you will find our enemies... Kill them... Kill them all...9866Will you do me one last honor, ? I do not wish to return to Garadar. I believe that my destiny lies elsewhere - that I will serve a greater purpose someday.Please, return to Farseer Corhuk and tell him that I will not be returning. That I cannot return. I must walk the earth... He will understand.9867We have lost many friends in recent weeks.For decades we have dealt with the ogres of Nagrand but now a new threat has arisen. The Broken tribe of Murkblood attacked our fishing village to the southwest, Sunspring Post, and managed to kill or evict all of the orcs that inhabited the town.While the others feel that the best course of action is to kill indiscriminately, I know that we must destroy their leadership. I do not know who their leader is but I suspect that you will know when you find him.9868Thank you, stranger. They would have surely killed me had it not been for you.I was kidnapped by these Murkbloods 3 nights ago during a nighttime raid on Garadar. What I have since uncovered may very well shake the foundation of the Outland: these savages seek to recover the totem of Kar'dash! We cannot allow the totem to fall into the hands of the Murkbloods!You must help me escape. And stranger, if I do not make it back to Garadar, you must tell Garrosh what happened here...9869Greetings, . I am Ioki, elementalist of the Earthen Ring.

Ortor of Murkblood, once a noble Broken, versed in the way of the elements, now a muck addled yes-man of Musel'ek the bog lord.The plans state that they have taken over an orc village northwest of here known as Sunspring.Travel to Sunspring Post and rid the world of Ortor of Murkblood. What you do, you do for the good of us all...9874I have just gotten word of a catastrophe of epic proportions, . The foul Murkblood have sacked the orc village of Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and murdered its residents. To make matters worse, they have begun dumping the bodies into Sunspring Lake. Should those bodies rot, our primary source of water in the region will be compromised.It's a gruesome task that I give you next but it must be done. Take this enchanted torch and return to Sunspring. Burn all of the rotting orc corpses...9875Lauranna must've missed this particular plant.  You're certain you've discovered a species not yet catalogued by Lauranna's work.  You'd best show it to her to see what she makes of it.9877The battle against the Scourge is not one without casualties.  Many are slain every day yet many more meet a worse fate.It is not uncommon for the Scourge to take prisoners.  Death would be preferable to what awaits them in Deatholme.  They're interrogated and tortured while under the effects of horrible will-breaking poisons.Apothecary Renzithen in Tranquillien has developed a remedy; go to him and retrieve this restorative draught.9878The appearance of the Murkblood in Nagrand has had a profound negative impact on our environment. The elementals are all in flux which has, in turn, greatly disturbed the wildlife. Worse yet, the razing of Sunspring Post has reignited the hatred that the orcs held for our people.While the Kurenai are a different tribe than the Murkblood, all an orc sees is Broken.We must make an effort to solve this dilemma. Travel to Sunspring Post, northwest of here, and resolve the Murkblood problem.9879I would have been killed had you not come along, stranger. They have already murdered so many Kurenai in their search for a lost relic.What they seek is the totem of Kar'dash. Why they think that we would know anything about this totem, I cannot understand. Is a totem not an orcish implement by nature?This information must be taken back to Arechron. Perhaps he knows why Murkblood are kidnapping Kurenai and torturing them for information regarding an orcish device.Let's go before more come.9882Nexus Prince Haramad has ordered us to not begin work inside of Oshu'gun as it might anger a certain powerful naaru.  Sort of puts a damper on our operation.I think I might've found a loophole, however.You see, we're not the only ethereals drawn to this colossal diamond.

Will you find him and give him your assistance? He hides on the border of Nagrand and Terokkar.9889I have been watching these beasts for days. The fat one says that he is waiting for something. What he is waiting for, however, is a mystery.I have a plan but it is going to involve some violence on your part. You will need to kill several of his subordinates and then beat him within an inch of his life. Do this and I am certain he will tell us everything that we need to know.9890For many years, Boulderfist ruled all ogres in the Outland. The ogres were united under Krol and content with the lands that they were given. In the past few months, we have lost many ogres to a new clan known as Warmaul. Warmaul has taken most of our land in Nagrand and killed many of our people.We had no choice but to take this town. We are being exterminated...Krol has gone missing and Boulderfist is in turmoil. Lantresor of the Blade rules in his absence.9891Take what you have learned and tell Jorin at Garadar.

The ogres of Nagrand wear warbeads made of obsidian, a mineral that commands a hefty price in many other worlds.Zerid already has had to take care a few of the brutes as a matter of security.  Think of the warbeads as an added bonus.  Or better yet, don't think about it too much and just bring them to me.9894In your travels, you might have encountered some of the expedition's watchers. They do the majority of the field work: documenting the unique inhabitants of the marsh, collecting samples, and making contact with sentient species.The safety of the watchers is paramount, . We've had to recall the watchers we sent to explore Funggor Cavern to the south, because of marshbeast attacks. Warden Hamoot believes that killing their leader, Lord Klaq, will bring a swift end to the attacks.9895Have you observed your surroundings closely, ? This is an ailing landscape, struggling to keep itself in balance and losing the fight.If you know where to look, you can see the symptoms. Members of some species rapidly outgrow their peers and become more aggressive.A good example of this uncontrolled growth is the marshtrekker Boglash. If you wish to see it for yourself, look no further than the waterways south of the refuge.Be prepared to defend yourself. The creature knows no mercy.9896By Khaz'goroth's flaming navel, it's hot here! I can't blame the first party for leaving, but everyone knows 'twasn't the heat that drove them away. No, it was Blacksting, although they won't admit it.They were camped just to the south of the glowing draenei towers to the west, just north of the Feralfen Village, when the giant wasp appears out of nowhere and attacks! I can't wait to see the looks on their faces when I bring the creature's stinger back to Ironforge and show it to them!9897I don't mind sharing.

There's a gigantic bog wasp known as Blacksting that roams the area south of the glowing draenei towers to the west. Bring me its stinger and I'll work my magic.9899Someone needs to find a way to make Reavij come to his senses! He's ignoring his duty and instead, he's devoting all his energy to getting my attention. I've tried ignoring him and telling him to stop. Nothing seems to work.Until he gets over this, I'm left cleaning up after him. He was supposed to have dealt with Sporewing, but I'll bet the monster is alive and well. If you have time, would you mind going to the western part of the Dead Mire and killing the bat? I'll deal with Reavij in the meantime.9900The presence of rogue ethereals in this area might amuse Gezhe, who sees nothing but opportunity wherever we go, but it's a true threat to the security of our operations.Their leader, Gava'xi, is a dangerous criminal and I've made it my top priority to see to it that he is neutralized.If you're looking to make yourself useful, go and take care of Gava'xi.  I will see to it that you're rewarded properly.9901The first expedition the league sent reported encountering a gigantic spore bat they'd taken to calling Sporewing. They had to leave in a hurry, so they didn't have the chance to kill him while they were here, so I figured I'd finish the job for them.What's left of their report suggests that the creature can be found in the southwestern parts of the Dead Mire. I think Vindicator Idaar mentioned that it's to the northeast of Telredor.9902Traveling through naga-infested lands has shown me the cruel truth about how my less fortunate brethren are treated. At Marshlight Lake, to the southwest, I observed a particularly malicious taskmaster playing a deadly game. He orders his slaves out to the islands in Marshlight Lake when he knows that Terrorclaw, a giant bogstrok, is ready to feed.I needn't describe what results. We are too few to take on the naga directly, but we can deprive them of their amusement by killing their pet.9903You've dealt with most of the little hydra, but I doubt Mragesh was impressed by your display. He's a cunning, ferocious beast and he's dogged many an angler in his time.I intend to be the last one he'll ever bother. He's bound to be hiding deep in the waters of Serpent Lake, to the northeast. He's a has-been; he just doesn't know it yet.9904I've caught every kind of fish that lives in the marsh, but there's one that eludes me. Sure, I've caught eels and mudfin frenzies. But the last time I was out on one of the islands in Marshlight Lake, I hooked a gigantic bogstrok that snapped my line and got away.Terrorclaw, he's called, and I won't rest until he's dead. He's too big for any fisherman to catch, so I suppose we'll just have to kill him the old-fashioned way.9905Last time Maktu was out hunting hydras for hides at Serpent Lake, he was attacked by the biggest hydra he's ever seen. Maktu reached for his spear, but it was too late. He had just enough time to escape becoming hydra food.Who knows? Maybe next time, Maktu not be so lucky. Maktu wants to be there so there won't be a next time. Will you help Maktu get his revenge on Mragesh?9906Ogres are moved by one thing: Might.

The only type of message that they are capable of understanding: Brutality.Travel to the Burning Blade Ruins, southeast of here and show them the might of the Mag'har.And , check in with the others before leaving.9907Directly west of here you will find the Halaani Basin. Within the basin are the twin clefts of Nagrand: Northwind and Southwind. Boulderfist shock troops use the clefts to hide their ogre mounds.I need you to track down those troops and kill all that you encounter in the name of Mag'har.9910If you're venturing into the Burning Blade Ruins, I have a task for you. Take these Mag'har battle standards and place them at three distinct locations in the ogre compound. An area of high visibility is recommended. Look for the gigantic flaming pyres on the upper levels. Place a standard near the first, second, and third Burning Blade pyres.The standard will leave a lasting impression upon any ogres who may have missed the battle.9911This bloody mandible comes from an unbelievably large creature. The nether ray that it belonged to has to be the largest ever seen in Zangarmarsh. Judging from the condition of the mandible, the count must've abandoned a diet of carrion in favor of living flesh.Surely the Cenarion Expedition would be interested in such a specimen. Watcher Leesa'oh has a small camp to the west of Quagg Ridge.9912The Cenarion Circle's main expeditionary force in Outland is known as the Cenarion Expedition.  Though it began as a small venture controlled directly by the Cenarion Circle, it's become a large and fairly autonomous body.The expedition's leader, Ysiel Windsinger, has asked us to direct volunteers to her outpost.  Report to her at the Cenarion Refuge in eastern Zangarmarsh.  Take the main path to the west and it will lead you directly there.9913My organization, the Consortium, is looking for a few resourceful individuals just like yourself.  You'll be hard pressed to find ethereals more honest, hard-working or pleasant to be around than us.All we require is loyalty, dedication and a reasonable amount of moral flexibility.  If you're interested, speak to Gezhe, our ground operations leader.  You will find him at Aeris Landing, north of Oshu'gun.9914Ivory is a much sought after prize.  I have many customers lined up in far off places to purchase it.I could be convinced to let you in on a cut of the profits.The wild elekk roaming Nagrand have the high quality of tusks that I'm after.  Steer clear of the bull elekk; their ivory isn't in the condition that I desire.Oh and don't worry, it's not poaching; I have an understanding with both the orcs and the draenei.Do you and I have an understanding?99159916The Boulderfist have moved the supplies they stole from our village to the twin clefts of Nagrand, found west of here in the Halaani Basin.While you are in the area, keep your eye out for the supply crates. If we can get those back, it would ease much of the burden that has fallen upon the matrons of Garadar.9917Do my eyes deceive me or is there an ogre hunting party over yonder? What could ogres be doing this far from their mound? I don't like this one bit, stranger. First Murkbloods and now ogres. We just don't have the manpower to handle all of these threats to our land.Could you investigate the ogre presence to the east for us? Their forward camp is about 200 paces east of here. You'll know you're at the right place if you see the Boulderfist hunters. Kill them to find the plans!9918The battle plans were written up by an ogre lieutenant. His name is either Dump or Lump.It could also be Billy.Anyhow, I think you should go back out there and have a word with Billy or Lump or Dumpy or whatever! Try to approach him diplomatically. If that doesn't work, try using some muscle.9919You're a kind , .  Not like some of the others I've met.You should meet the rest of my people; they'll be very grateful for your help.  Take these spore sacs to my leader, Msshi'fn.  You will find him in Sporeggar, north of here.9920You must seek out Mo'mor immediately! You will find him in the center of Telaar, by the fountain. Tell him exactly what the ogre told you.9921These ogre hunting parties are a precursor to invasion. We must strike at them before they have a chance to amass an army big enough to take over our town.You're going to need to get your hands dirty, .The largest collection of Boulderfist in this region can be found at the Burning Blade Ruins, almost directly east of Telaar, near the border of Terokkar. Go there and show the Boulderfist that Telaar will not bend to their will!9922You made a strong showing, . Are you ready for more?I have received reports of a large contingent of Boulderfist ogres hidden in the twin clefts of Nagrand, northwest of here in the Halaani Basin.Venture forth to the clefts and deal with the remaining Boulderfist ogres.9923HELP! They're gonna eat me! I just know it!Find the key, I know it has to be on one of these ogres.If you get me out of here, my father will reward you handsomely! He's the leader of Telaar, Arechron.9924This is so embarrassing. Do you remember my boy, Corki? You rescued him from the Burning Blade Ruins recently. Well, his curiosity has gotten the best of him once more. He told me that he was going to investigate the Boulderfist menace for 'uncle' Mo'mor and ran off to the ogre mounds in the Halaani Basin, north of here.Do you think you could track him down? I would be eternally grateful.9925Gezhe chose to base our operations as close to Oshu'gun as possible, without any regard for the safety of our crew.  Why?  Because he projected a ten percent increase in productivity by setting up shop here instead of in the mountains to the south.Never mind the crazed voidspawn wandering all of ten feet away from us.  That would be the security officer's problem, not Gezhe's.Kill some voidspawn for me and I'll pay you a tenth of our security budget.  Don't get excited, it's not much of a budget.9927These are Warmaul ogre banners that I recently acquired.I want you to travel to Kil'sorrow Fortress, directly south of here, and kill as many of the Kil'sorrow filth as you can find.

Return to me when you have completed this task and the other that this plan requires.9928You will need to steal Kil'sorrow armaments from Kil'sorrow Fortress if my plan is to work.Search the fortress for crates of Kil'sorrow armaments. Bring whatever you can find to me.Kil'sorrow Fortress is located directly south and a little to the west of the Burning Blade Ruins.9931Now you must plant the seed of war in the fat, useless heads of the Warmaul. To the northwest, near the mountains, you will find the Laughing Skull Ruins.Do you recognize those banners? They are Kil'sorrow banners. I want you to take a stack of Kil'sorrow banners and plant them on the corpses of Warmaul ogres. Remember, northwest is where you will find the ogres.9932Your rampage through Kil'sorrow Fortress has provided us with a special opportunity. We have enough bodies to make it appear as if a great battle has taken place.Travel to the Laughing Skull Ruins and find the Laughing Skull Courtyard. There should be a blazing pyre in the courtyard. Make sure the area is secure and then use this blanket to send up smoke signals. When my ogres see the smoke, they will sneak in and plant the bodies of slain Kil'sorrow soldiers.That should be the final straw!9933Take it. It is my offering to your people.

Would you honor the Mag'har by helping one of their matrons?Several days ago we sent a funeral procession to the Ancestral Grounds and they have yet to return. Will you go search for them? They took the western road out of Garadar. Follow it around and avoid Halaa.9945We were en route to the Ancestral Grounds when we were ambushed by Warmaul. They came from all sides, killing several of the procession guards and many of the others. They even desecrated the remains of the elder in the wagon.And for what? So they could humiliate us and display their power. Not even Boulderfist would have sunk so low.I am a spiritual orc, , but even I have limitations. Find the attackers at Warmaul Hill to the northwest and destroy them!9946Have you ever seen an ogre king, ? Few have and lived to tell the tale. Unfortunately, that is exactly what we are dealing with here.The leader of these barbarians is an ogre named Cho'war. Rumor has it that Cho'war was the ogre responsible for forcing the gronn out of the cave. Cho'war then declared himself king and dissolved the ogre clans that served under the gronn. Thus, Warmaul was born.Find Cho'war deep in the caves of Warmaul Hill. Slay him and bring me his head.9948If I know anything about ogres, it's that they like their food fresh. This means that the Mag'har that they captured are more than likely being kept alive until they are ready to serve. It's a sickening thought, I know, but one that we must use to our advantage.Venture to Warmaul Hill and search for Mag'har prisoners. If you find prisoners, then you will find keys to their cages on the nearby Warmaul ogres.Kill ogres for their keys and release the prisoners.9951Quick, hide!  The eyes of Naphthal'ar are upon you... upon us all!I dare not go to the top of the tower to speak with it, but you... you look as if you might know the right words to say.

But, by all means, get it to stop staring at me!9954I just received this letter. It's from a clan of ogres known as Warmaul that rule the northwestern lands of Nagrand. It says that they have Corki and if we don't cooperate, they're going to eat him. Admittedly, Corki is a moron, but he's still my blood. Will you rescue him, ?I presume that he's locked up in a cage somewhere on Warmaul Hill. That should be your first stop.9955They call him Cho'war the Pillager, . He's the ogre that forced out the gronn that used to rule over these ogres. You better believe he's powerful!The chef said that Cho'war lives in the big cave - wherever that may be... Get that key and get me out of here! If we live through this, my father will no doubt give you the big reward! As soon as I'm free, seek him out.9956I was part of a caravan taking supplies to the Orebor Harborage in Zangarmarsh. As we were nearing the border of the marsh, we were jumped by a vicious squad of Warmaul ogres. They killed the others and took me prisoner, along with all of our supplies.Thankfully, they neglected to place a backing on my cage. When they fell asleep, I made my escape.It's too late for my comrades but we could really use the supplies they stole. Warmaul Hill is in the northwestern mountains of Nagrand.9957We haven't heard from the druids at the Cenarion Thicket of Terokkar Forest in quite some time., I'd like for you to go down there and check in with them to see what's happening.  There are several ways to get there, but the fastest is to head south along the path, and then take the road that branches east from Shattrath City once you're in the forest.9960Hey there, .

This is unusual as we usually hear from them at least once every few days.I want you to go up there and make sure that they're alright.  You can find the thicket by heading northwest through the forest.9962So are you ready for your first battle? If you are, let me know and I'll get things started. All you have to do is go wait in the Ring of Blood for your opponent to arrive.This fight is against Brokentoe, a ferocious clefthoof.Good luck! I hope you brought friends.And remember, the fight's over when either you or your opponent are lying face down on the arena floor.9967This next battle involves a duo - twin brothers to be precise. They call themselves the \"Blue Brothers.\"It's not too late to chicken out, . I'd certainly understand.But if you're ready for some action, step in the Ring of Blood and wait for the Murkblood twins to arrive.Last one standing is the winner!9968Something strange has changed the teromoths of the thicket.Where once there was a diversity of life in there, now only the teromoths remain.  And while before they were at peace, now they are agitated and will not hesitate to attack you should you get close.I need to compare the vicious ones to the normal.  Collect for me a number of samples from both.  You'll find the unaffected teromoths both to the south and the north.I'm certain this is related to whatever killed all of the druids.9970This fight is gonna be painful, . Do you have any friends that are brave enough to help you out? The ogres managed to get a giant from Blade's Edge named Rokdar! Trust me, you're gonna need friends, he seems unbeatable! He's hard as a rock - literally!If you still want to fight him, step into the Ring of Blood and he will come.9971I have no idea what killed all of the druids here.  I've been away for a couple of days on a survey of the Bone Wastes to the south.Please, you must help me to uncover what's behind this horrible tragedy.  Go into the thicket and look for a clue that might reveal something to us.  When I was in there briefly, I could have sworn I saw a dead Broken and a strange object next to him. And don't worry about Treelos - he might have been driven insane by what happened, but I think he's mostly harmless.9972You're murderin' 'em out there, kid! They got a ringer for the next match. They say he's a void lord or something... No way do they want you up against their champion. Did you here that palooka, Mogor, yapping at you? The bets are through the roof!Get in that ring and take this one out fast!9973They had to ship the champion in from the Blade's Edge gladiator pits. He was training on mountain giants - three at a time.If you win this one, you become the new champion. What do you think your odds are, kid? Do you have a shot? Just give me the word and I'll bet the house on you.Now get in there and win!9977You've made me a lot of money, kid. If you can defeat Mogor, I promise to make it worth your while. All that pain you suffered in the Ring of Blood is gonna end up paying off.Now get in there and show these ogres what you're made of!9978I don't know what to make of all of this, but I do know how we can find more clues.Empoor is a Broken merchant that traffics in all sorts of goods and information.  If you were to persuade him to talk, I'm sure he might have something interesting to say.He travels the road here between Tuurem and Shattrath.  Watch out, though -- he travels with a bodyguard.9979I was asked to pick up and deliver some boxes of goods from an ethereal in Shattrath City.Last I saw him, he was standing outside of the World's End Tavern in Lower City.  His name is Wind Trader Lathrai, and that's all that I know!Want more answers, go talk with him!9982A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week. He introduced himself as Altruis and then proceeded to ask us several questions about Nagrand.He claimed that he was hunting Legion. That such insanity was actually his job. Can you imagine? A person that would willingly hunt demons?Before he left, he asked that we let the would-be heroes in town know that he will be staying in western Nagrand for awhile and that should they seek a purpose, to find him.9983A being riding atop a nether drake arrived in town late last week.

I'm not sure what they'd be used for, but I know that they were delivered to Tuurem.Perhaps one or more of those boxes is still there?9991To be my eyes will require some diligence on your part. Nethrandamus will take you through the Legion camps, but you must catalog everything that you see. Even the smallest detail that you may think to be inconsequential could be useful for our purposes.Primarily, I want you to note what structures are in the camps and what comprises the camps' defenses.Nethrandamus is ready when you are, . Do not be afraid, he will keep you safe from harm.9992Aren't the trees in the forest beautiful? I've often wondered if they would survive on Azeroth.I'm hesitant to send back seedlings, though. It's a rough trip and they're much harder to transport than something like a sack of seeds. The seeds are stored in tough cones that fall from the tree's branches once they've reached maturity.If you come upon some of those cones in your travels, would you mind bringing some of the seeds back to me?9993The oily seeds from the forest's olemba trees could prove very valuable. I'd like to gather a larger quantity of them, press them for their oil, and then see what I can do with it.Just think, there's a whole forest full of trees out there, producing a lot of seeds that go to waste. I don't care if it turns out to be cooking oil, lamp oil, or weapon oil, I won't let it go to waste!Bring me any of the seeds that you happen to gather from the olemba cones. They're all over the place.9994I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are.  I do know one thing though - they look dangerous!, I think you should take this box of parts to Jenai Starwhisper at the Allerian Stronghold to the southeast.  She may have some idea of what these are.9995I don't know about you, but I have no idea what all of those things are.

And from what you've told me, clearly they are using the Broken of Tuurem as smuggling go-betweens for the creation of some horrible weapon.Whatever they're up to out there, the most efficient thing that we can do right now is to thin out their numbers.The Firewing blood elves need to be taken out!

They wasted no time in starting to construct fortifications and repair the buildings.The construction goes on day and night, . I've dispatched one of my most reliable agents to keep watch, but we can ill afford to delay action. Move against their workers, then seek out Theloria Shadecloak at the Allerian Post to the north of the Bonechewer Ruins. She'll give you further instructions.9999As long as the transporters stand, nothing we do to the forge camps will have any permanence.

The master planner dictates what types of structures are present at a forge camp and how each structure is situated. Moreover, this information is kept on a set of blueprints that the planner carries around on their person.We need the master planner's blueprints. Armed with such exacting information, we could persuade an acquaintance of mine to lend some assistance.Find the mo'arg master planner and take his blueprints. He will be stationed behind the forges.10002Over the past couple of days, I've observed a blood elf woman traveling to and from the fel orc stronghold and conversing with the fel orc leader. From her body language, she's clearly issuing orders. But why? Whose orders is she conveying?My curiosity got the better of my judgment and I shadowed her when she left the fel orc encampment. She headed north, to Firewing Point.

If that does not work, use your fists.10005, after you're done celebrating here, I think that you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren.I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.10006, I think that after you're done celebrating here, you should go back to the Cenarion Thicket and speak with Earthbinder Tavgren.I'm certain that he'll want to know what really happened out there.10007Knowing Thander and Bertelm, they won't tolerate such a large buildup of hostile forces on our doorstep. Asking them to dispatch members of the garrison to participate in an attack on the camp isn't an option either. It would just leave us too vulnerable to attack.It falls to us to do what we can to diminish the threat the fel orc buildup poses. Kill what you can of their forces and I will look for ways to stall any reinforcements.10008If word reaches Thrallmar that they've failed to contain the fel orcs, we're going to be receiving a lot of company down here. Frankly, I'm not sure I want all that attention, so we're going to keep this little problem under wraps, got it?If we can inflict enough casualties on the fel orcs, chances are their presence will never come to the attention of anyone outside Stonebreaker. So, let's end it now.Wade in there, swing your weapon, wave your hands, or whatever it is you do - just kill fel orcs.10009This Sal'salabim design.Look at towers. Demon hunter no can see, yes?

You will need it if you are to face an overseer.Once you are ready, find and kill the overseers at each camp. Take their keys and use them to turn and fire the fel cannons upon the camps. Return to me once the camps are destroyed.10012The writing on the plans is far too delicate and precise to have come from any of the fel orcs. You can't make out what the text says, but the implications are pretty clear: the fel orcs are taking orders from the blood elves at Firewing Point.Why would the two forces be working together? Bertelm might have some insight into this odd alliance.

I've had the opportunity to observe them while mapping some of the northern reaches of the forest. I wouldn't recommend getting close to them unless you're prepared for combat.They have no fear of us and won't hesitate to defend their territory.It's fitting that such a creature would have a magnificent tail. I've been trying to collect enough of them to trim a new cloak, but the worgs have a habit of evading my snares. Will you help?10017More and more refugees come through the gates of Shattrath City each day.  Some have sustained such injuries, it's a real wonder they made it here.I can deal with most of the conventional injuries; my training as an Aldor healer has prepared me for that.  Poison wounds are more problematic as my anti-venom supplies have begun to run low.Bring me venom sacs from the local dreadfang spiders so I can produce more antidotes.  You'll find a pocket of the spiders in the southeastern region of Terokkar.10018Generations ago, when orc clans still called Terokkar Forest home, the wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they had no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind.In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest.I believe I can bring the wolf spirit back to his ancestral home, just as we orcs have returned. The ritual will require me to create vestments from the pelts of the wolves of the forest to guide the spirit back to its home.1001910020The woman to my right suffered a severe injury to the head.  She survived, but lost her eyesight.A traditional cure used among my people requires the blood of a very old basilisk.Unfortunately, due to poaching from various groups, Terokkar basilisks don't tend to live very long.There is one basilisk whose name I've known since I was a youngling.  It is known only as \"Stonegazer\" and it's rumored to live east of here, near the land's edge.Bring me its blood so that Zahlia may see once again.10021Much of this region was inhabited by draenei long ago.  We Aldor were charged with the safeguarding of our holy sites and altars.  Many of them have since been destroyed or taken over by our enemies.To the east of here there is an arakkoa outpost.  It was purposefully built on the location of three of our sacred altars. The arakkoa use their foul magic to warp and defile the innate power of our shrines.Take this to the arakkoa outpost and use it to cleanse the three altars.10022Now that I have the fur I'll need for the trim, I've been thinking that the pelt of a particular wolf would make a good hood for my cloak. Imagine seeing your enemy clad in the pelt of the most cunning predator in the forest!I've tried trapping old Ironjaw without success. I've tried cornering him, outsmarting him, and baiting him. None of it has worked.He stalks the northeastern reaches of the forest, and I'd gladly reward you if you could succeed where I have failed.10023You've done well in gathering the first pelts.The final piece of the vestments requires a pelt unlike any other. There is one particular wolf, an old and cunning one, that has earned his place as the patriarch of the forest wolves. He is known among them as Ironjaw, the mighty hunter.In my visions, I have seen him wandering the northeastern region of the forest. Including his pelt in the vestments will surely light the wolf spirit's path.Do not mourn Ironjaw. He will be well honored.10024Our leader, Voren'thal the Seer, was once a close advisor to Kael'thas.  His prophetic visions warned him that Kael's path would lead to the destruction of our race.The visions are usually vague and unfocused, but our alchemists have devised an elixir to help him focus his clairvoyance.  Unfortunately, this elixir calls for a rare ingredient: basilisk eyes.  My usual source, this pathetic ethereal, has failed me.Seek the dampscale basilisks in the rocky regions of Terokkar and bring me their eyes.1002510026It's embarrassing to admit this, but something has happened to me here in Terokkar Forest that hasn't occurred since my apprentice days.Occasionally, my spells will fizzle when I know I've done everything correctly. I almost drove myself crazy the first time it happened.I think I've found the cause. The forest is full of creatures called warp stalkers, demonic creatures with an affinity for magic and a habit of disturbing magical flows. The best way to deal with them is simply to kill them.10027There's nothing more annoying than preparing to cast a spell, only to have it interrupted by some unseen force. After the fourth time, I knew it couldn't be coincidence and I sent Keb'ezil out to investigate.I guarantee you'll never encounter an imp that talks back more than Keb.Anyway, he managed to find the source of the problem, a pesky creature known as a warp stalker.

The time has come to terminate his command, . Terminate with extreme prejudice. Head west to the Pools of Aggonar and put an end to this so-called 'Legion lord'. Today, the Horde reclaims Hellfire Peninsula. Let the Legion be damned.10140When you're ready, I'll arrange a flight straight to Honor Hold.From there, speak with Marshal Isildor and give him Duron's report.  He'll be happy to see another recruit from the homelands, and I'm sure the information in that report is important stuff!10141While the Burning Legion invaded Azeroth, they were also at work here, in Outland.  We have tracked their movements over the years, but this latest activity,  - well, this is beyond anything we've seen.Seek out Sergeant Altumus near the eastern supply caravan. She has been monitoring the invaders and may have insights into their purpose.Be swift - and take care,  - the Burning Legion is not to be underestimated.10142Doom Lord Kazzak commands the Burning Legion in Outland. While we can't get to Kazzak - yet - we can and must get to his lieutenants that command Legion troops from the ground.They have stationed dreadlords at the Path of Anguish, east of here. They are the ones responsible for these infernal storms that rain down upon our heads. To take them and their minions out would be a great set back to the Burning Legion.10143Your battle prowess has been noted by high command, . They want to send you to the front lines to meet up with Rohamus's crew. They're radicals, devoted to the complete extermination of the Burning Legion, so you may fit right in...Head east about 400 paces, across the Valley of Bones, until you run into a destroyed fel reaver. You'll see Expedition Point where a Legion base used to stand. Once there, you are to report to Forward Commander Kingston.Now move out!10144You'll find the Legion front to our northeast, and spaced along it are portals used to gather reinforcements from throughout Outland. We, , are going to destroy those portals!Take this primer.  Designed in Area 52, it uses the demons' own power as an explosive device!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Grimh and Kaalez to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate the stones inside the portals... then watch the fireworks!!Go, , and return to me when your mission is complete.10146Just west of the Dark Portal are two huge transporters: Gateway Murketh and Gateway Shaadraz.If you look east up the Path of Glory, you'll see them on either side of the road.  I want you to bomb them both into rubble!Here are the bombs you'll use, specially designed by a goblin in Area 52.  Now, speak with Wing Commander Dabir'ee -- he'll put you on a gryphon and send you on your way.10159We've been fighting an ongoing battle to keep the pass through Thornfang Hill to the west clear of ravagers.  It would be bad if we were to become completely cut off from the refuge in Zangarmarsh.We don't want to displace the creatures, but there seems to be little choice as their attacks on travelers through the area have become more aggressive.Clear some of the ravagers out of there if you can.10160Rumors have surfaced that some new breed of orc is on the rise. Larger, meaner - more cunning than the brutes we're familiar with.  If these rumors are true then our forces, already stretched, may be taxed beyond their limit.I have entrusted my lieutenant, Amadi, with investigating this matter. If you would help us in this dark hour, seek her out. She is stationed at the broken tower just west of the Hold.And  - be careful out there. You're heading into a dangerous new world.10161In the event of an emergency, it's always the pilot's job to keep a level head, especially when the only orders your co-pilot follows come from his stomach.The good news is that we won't need to wait days for replacement parts to be imported. The bad news is that the \"spare\" parts got scattered from here to the Valley of Bones to the east.The other bad news? The spare parts aren't so spare. They, uh, fell off during our rapid descent. Could you help me collect enough to get us off the ground again?10162Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission?This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north. I need you to get on a wyvern and destroy the whole damned thing!Here are your bombs - now, talk to Wing Commander Brack when you're ready for takeoff.10163Now that you've got your wings, perhaps you'd be interested in running another bombing mission?This time we've isolated the Legion's main production area, behind the forge camps to the north.

A better time.Unfortunately, memories are the last thing I need right now.I want you to bury this by the runestone in the Scorched Grove.  It was there that I first met the treant elder.  Put my old friend's memory to rest.10167Deep within the Auchenai Crypts is a tomb: A tomb unlike any that exists on this shattered realm. It was from this tomb, the first tomb, that the vast mausoleum of Auchindoun was born.You must venture to the Auchenai Crypts of Auchindoun and find this tomb. Slay the guardian of the crypt to release the captive spirit within. The spirit holds the key...10168For several centuries, the spirits of Auchindoun coalesced into my darkened essence. Many of the catastrophes that befell this crypt were a direct result of my weakened state.Regrettably, there is nothing that can be done to stop this cycle. It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist.Your only recourse is to destroy the ancient spirits of Nagrand before they transform into creatures of the void. Use the soul mirrors found throughout this crypt to free them...10170Return to Greatmother Geyah at Garadar with news of your victory, . This will surely lift the spirits of the Mag'har. Perhaps even the young Hellscream will be lifted from his malaise.10171You have done so much for the Mag'har, . Your accomplishments are known to all, including Garrosh. Go to him now and tell him of your latest victory. Tell him that you do what you do for him and his people. Surely he will be lifted by your words.10172You are an honorable , . You have done much for the Mag'har. No one could ever deny your service to my people. Alas, the time of the Mag'har is at an end. You have shown me, more than anything, that I am unfit to lead these people. My cursed blood runs too deep. I will not... I cannot become the second Hellscream to damn the orcs.Please, , return to the Greatmother and tell her what I have told you. I am too ashamed to see her... to look into her eyes.10173Allow me to introduce myself, .I am Ravandwyr, apprentice to the Archmage Vargoth.My master is... indisposed, shall we say. I am here on a matter of great importance.The Arklon Ruins southeast of the city are a hotbed of Burning Legion activity. Their purpose in the ruins concerns neither me nor my master, but their leader, Ekkorash, possesses the archmage's staff.This conjuring powder will allow you to draw the demon out of hiding. Sprinkle it on the brazier at the center of the ruins.10174Now, you will be able to use the archmage's staff to contact him.He resides in the Violet Tower, on an 'island' to the southeast. The tower is both sanctuary and prison to him, cursed as it is. Kirin Tor can neither enter nor leave, keeping me apart from my master.The staff's magic can penetrate the tower's defenses, but only if invoked by one outside the Kirin Tor.Take the archmage's staff and use it to conjure his image. Tell him what has happened and that I have not completely failed him.10176Now that you've gathered all the items I'll need to break Kael'thas's curse, one thing remains to be done. When Kael'thas sealed the tower, he placed an arcane golem, known as Ar'kelos, at the bottom of the tower.You must defeat Ar'kelos in order allow me to work magic within the tower again.When you enter the Violet Tower, the curse will begin to affect you.Once you have defeated Ar'kelos, ascend the tower and assist me in making preparations for the ritual.10180I tried to persuade Isfar to remain here, in the safety of Shattrath, but he would have none of it. Instead, he's decided to venture out to Auchindoun again on his own.He was lucky enough to escape the Sethekk Halls once, but if they discover him, there won't be a second time.I admire his desire to free his sister, but he's not going to be able to do it without help.Find Isfar and have a word with him, . If you can't persuade him to come back, perhaps you could help him rescue Lakka?10182The sword is of exceptional quality, finely crafted and perfectly balanced for a battle-mage. The seal of the Kirin Tor and the name \"Dathric\" are engraved into the weapon's pommel.Turning the weapon over in your hands, you notice a sense of wrongness radiating from the metal, as if the item is torn between two worlds. Could this be the item anchoring Battle-Mage Dathric's spirit to this world?Perhaps returning it to its proper place can break the bond, freeing Dathric's spirit to rest at last.10183I'm out here studying the nether - the ethereal currents and all that.  This is an ideal spot away from the lights and hubbub of town.  Isn't this bridge great?  If I could just keep this junk working.Hey, you know, if you're looking for work there's plenty at Area 52!  It's just up the path and take a right at the fork in the road.Why don't you deliver my latest research notes to Rocket-Chief Fuselage?  I'm sure that he'd have plenty for you to do, what with the X-52 rocket ship, and all!10184Most of the spirits in the village are little more than pale remnants of Kirin Tor mages. They retain no knowledge of their former selves and wander the ruins in blind anger.It wasn't always like this, though. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, the spirits were restless, but not spiteful. With the passage of time they have only grown more aggressive. I dare not venture into the southern part of the village, for they will not spare even me. Quiet them and let us hope it will purge their anger.10185After the blood elves leveled Kirin'Var Village, they started the construction of a large building to the northwest. Without the expertise of the archmage, we can't say for certain what's going on there.One thing is clear, though. The blood elf activities have unleashed a tide of ravenous mana elementals on the village. They seem drawn to the ruins of Wizard Row, wreaking further destruction. We cannot permit this to continue.10186Let me be the first to welcome you aboard, Junior Technician 3rd Grade !We're building my masterpiece out here - the X-52 Nether-Rocket!But first we need to get all of the parts and fuel for it.  That's where you come in.To start, I need crystals - LOTS of crystals - for the rocket's Etherlithium Engine Matrix.  The draenei had crystals coming out of their ears!So head north to the Ruins of Enkaat and get them for me!  Nevermind all of the draenei ghosts.10188Before we departed Azeroth all those years ago, the Kirin Tor entrusted our expedition with a powerful artifact, the Sigil of Krasus. It was a great boon to us in our battle against the orcs and it could play a key role in helping me break the enchantment that imprisons me.However, when Kael'thas divested me of my possessions, he gave the sigil to Spellbinder Maryana, who remained behind with the garrison. If he truly realized what he had in his possession, he wouldn't have given it away so easily.10189You may have noticed one of Kael's manaforges on your way here.  You know, the large purple buildings sucking energy from the sky?We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate them.  You can help our information gathering efforts by obtaining a personnel roster.  Giving us an idea of who's there and what they do will prove to be invaluable information.We believe Captain Arathyn, leading a ballista team just outside of Manaforge B'naar, is in possession of one such roster.  Obtain it for us.10190I have the very important task of collecting the machinery inside these ruins, but I'm having a problem keeping all of my bots charged up.The phase hunters - those wyrm-looking things - have lots of energy!  You can find them all over the edges of this island, floating in from the nether.Fill the battery on this recharging blaster by using it on a phase hunter when they're very weak, and then finish it off to soak up the last of its energy.10191Greetings, .  I am charged up and fully functional.There are fragile draenei machines in these ruins, which I must retrieve.  I am equipped with delicate servos in my wrist actuators, and the latest in combustion-pneumatic bump soakers.  Handling them with care will not be an issue.However, the ghosts that haunt these ruins will likely attack, so I will need you and your friends along for protection.10192The Kirin Tor sent one other of Krasus's possessions with our expedition. It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war.Before Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town.10193Based on the roster information, we know that the brains of the manaforge operations are the warp-masters and warp-engineers.  It is they who oversee the retrieval of a so called \"warp-energy\" by the manaforge and its delivery to a remote destination via a system of underground pipes.The only other specialists in the area are geologists.  Everyone else is either part of the military or a magister crony; both easily replaced.Get in there and kill Kael's specialists; that's what'll hurt him the most.10194While you were gone, my men uncovered another one of these manaforges.  It is east of here and is known as Manaforge Coruu.Two of my best spies have arranged a secret landing spot outside of the manaforge.  You are to help them infiltrate Kael's forces and obtain whatever information you can.Speak to Veronia just outside the city walls; she's arranged for a windrider that will take you to Manaforge Coruu.  Once there, speak to Caledis Brightdawn; he will brief you on your mission.10197Infiltrating the ranks of Kael's army will not be an easy task.  With my knowledge of illusionary magic I could pass you off as one of Kael's followers, but there are certain details in their uniforms I could not replicate.Bring me a set of their robes, a pair of their gloves and a Sunfury guardsman medallion.  This will make the results of my magic much more convincing.10198I've prepared a uniform with the pieces you obtained.  It is magically enhanced to complete the illusion.We spotted Commander Dawnforge going in to meet Arcanist Ardonis a few minutes ago.  He had a full retinue of guards with him, so whatever they're discussing is bound to be incredibly important; see if you can catch any of it.Oh, I almost forgot.  You'll want to stay away from the arcane golems patrolling the manaforge.  They will see right through the illusion.10199So, I'm just missing the one ingredient that'll give my concoction that little extra kick that it needs.The sting of the nether rays, roaming around near the shaleskin flayers, delivers quite a punch.  Bring me some of their stingers and I'll extract the venom right out of them!I'm certain the results will be explosive!10200It would be best if this information got back to Thalodien as soon as possible.  I'll stay here and cover our tracks.It wouldn't do us much good to have Kael'thas find out what we were snooping around here.  Secret information is always better if your enemy doesn't know you have it.10201The oil is finally ready for its first test. It seems heavy enough to serve as a high quality weapon oil.The only way to find out is to have a professional try it out. See Grek over there by the wanted posters? Sure, he's no poet, but the orc knows his way around a weapon!Take a sample of the oil to him and ask him to use it on his weapon. After he's had a chance to test it out, let me know what he thinks of it.10202We've recently been contacted by a Sunfury magister who wishes to join our ranks and swears he has information we're in need of.  We've checked our informants to make sure he's not a double agent and he checks out.He's stationed in Manaforge Ara which makes communication difficult.  Talk to him and see what he knows.  If he's half as useful as he claims to be, we'll be able to put him to good use.10203See the fissure running through Area 52?  We did that!  It's yielding up all sorts of goodies for the X-52 Nether-Rocket, but we're running short on equipment.We had an operation at the Arklon Ruins to the southeast until the Burning Legion moved in.  I need you to take this Ultra Deconsolodation Zapper to the ruins.  Use it to beam our gear back to Lead Sapper Blastfizzle down in the fissure.Junior Technician 3rd Grade , this is your chance for that promotion.  Don't blow it!10204Kael's magisters have refined their usage of mana crystals to the point where they can siphon large amounts of energy in a matter of seconds.They do this by attuning smaller bloodgem crystal shards to larger, fully charged ones.Go to Manaforge B'naar and obtain one of these shards from a Sunfury magister and use it to siphon energy from one of the larger crystals.Return to me so that I may study the effects of the aura.  Do not worry; any side effects should be temporary.10205Warp-Raider Nesaad must be dealt with!  I have no idea how he survived my attack, but he cannot be allowed to continue his operation out there.Go back and take out Nesaad.  He keeps a small ethereal camp near the southwestern corner of the Heap.Don't fail like I did, .10206Those ethereal clowns are as opportunistic as us, I'll give them that.  But no one, and I mean NO ONE, moves in on a B.O.O.M. claim!The Heap to the south is ours!If we're to finish the X-52 Nether-Rocket, we're going to need all of the new tech that we can get our hands on.  And since the ethereals are stealing from us, I think it's only fair that we repay them in kind.Why don't you head down there and see if you can acquire some of their technology out from under their noses!10208Directly east of here is the Legion Front.  Spaced across the front are infernal portals and gateways, used to bring reinforcements to Hellfire Peninsula and throughout Outland. We're going to destroy those portals!Take these primers.  Designed in Area 52, they use the demons' own power as an explosive!  Defeat Legion forces around Portals Xilus and Kruul to gather demonic rune stones, use the primer to detonate four stones inside the portals, and watch!  Return to me when your mission is complete.10209The next thing we must do is reclaim my familiar, Glacius, from the blood elf summoner who holds it captive. Summoner Kanthin was one of the most senior magisters in the force Kael'thas sent to decimate Kirin'Var. It's only natural that he would claim my familiar as a kind of trophy.I'm certain that Kanthin, fool that he is, has tried to compel Glacius to serve him. My scrying has revealed that Kanthin is now stationed at 'Manaforge Duro,' if that terminology has any meaning for you.10210Welcome to Shattrath City, .  This might be the one place in all of Outland where you'll find any semblance of safety.A group of naaru known as the Sha'tar drove the demons away from here.If you've never met a naaru, you ought to see A'dal inside the Terrace of Light.  The leader of the Sha'tar is an awe-inspiring sight if I ever saw one.  Sure is a change of pace from anything else in this bleak land.10211Do not burden A'dal with petty inquisitions, .  That just might be the most powerful being you ever come face to face with.You do not look familiar.  I suppose you want to learn about the city?You'll have to excuse me if I don't give you a tour myself, but I'm a bit busy discussing strategy with A'dal.  Perhaps you'll find a summoned servant acceptable in my stead?  Excellent!10213When I was wounded in the wastes I saw a goblin zeppelin crash.  It went down to the northwest, beyond the Expedition Armory. The zeppelin was on fire.  Shrieking, burning goblins were falling like bombs from the sky.  Of course I was in a lot of pain and I had lost a lot of blood.  I may have imagined the whole thing.If you can find any survivors, we can offer them sanctuary here at Spinebreaker Post.10220I was sent here to make contact with the Unyielding spirits.  These once proud Alliance soldiers were defeated long ago, and now their cursed spirits haunt the ruins to the west.  If they would only join us we would gain a powerful ally.  Imagine, a legion of undying warriors to use against our enemies.  But these undead are mad with hatred and will not listen to me.  Perhaps they can be forced to join us.10221, my former protege, Sparky Uberthruster, wouldn't wear his helmet while down here and one day transformed into the infamous Dr. Boom!And he stole off to the northeast with most of our sapping equipment!  He and his Boom Bots have been a menace to Area 52 ever since.I need you to go to his Camp of Boom just outside of town and put an end to him!  Use these Boom's Doom bombs to take him out.And make sure not to get too close to him or his Boom Bots!10222After Prince Kael'thas's forces destroyed the village and imprisoned the archmage in the Violet Tower, they withdrew to Sunfury Hold to the northeast. The very men who destroyed our village and slew our fellows toast their 'amazing victory' while we are helpless to avenge the fallen.We must not allow these crimes to go unanswered! Be the instrument of our vengeance, . Go to Sunfury Hold and claim the lives of those responsible for this crime.10223I'll never forget the blood elf who led the attack. He wore a tabard with a device I've never seen before, over top of crimson armor.He was ferocious and merciless, leading from the front where most other blood elf officers would never be seen. He was responsible for the deaths of many Kirin Tor mages that day, but he didn't linger long at Sunfury Hold. Kael'thas has ordered him to Manaforge Duro to aid in their attempt to control the area. Find him, , and silence his bow for good.10224As the X-52's chief of engineering, I have to see to it that the nether-rocket's main engines are in tip-top shape.Unfortunately, I haven't built them yet., I'm in dire straits here!  I have almost all of the parts.  All that I'm missing is the engine core.Luckily for us, I think we can make use of the essence from the local mana wraiths to jump-start the engines.They can be found near most of the glowing trenches in the northern part of the island.  Except for here in Area 52, of course.10225!  I need you to take all of these etherlithium crystals over to Chief Engineer Trep, my, uh, chief of engineering.He should know what to do with them.  And if he doesn't, you see to it that he finds out!10226Darn it, that didn't do it!Ok, I've got another idea!  I had Xyrol whip up an elemental power extractor.  I'm not certain exactly what this power will do, but I know that I can use it.The sundered rumblers and warp aberrations on the ledge of the Crumbling Wastes to the south have just what I need for the engines!The extractor will change the form of their power into something solid that you'll be able to gather up after you've defeated them.10227I see dead draenei. They're all around us.Bah, nobody believes me because I'm a child. Not even my own mommy believes me.He believes me, though... He sees them too. Boy does he get angry about it!It's kind of funny. I see ghosts and people just smile and pat me on the head, trying to placate me. Ramdor sees ghosts and people label him as crazy. I sure hope I never grow up!You should probably talk to Ramdor before you go inside. He was once a death priest.10228I believe that the dead, which we have been caring for these last 500 odd years, should be left alone. Maladaar has other plans. He has retreated to the Crypt of Remembrance to start his experiments... Necromancy.I hope you weren't thinking about going in there... Not before helping me out so that these damned spirits will finally leave me alone. I know where they keep their treasures, . Got your attention, eh?Bring me the book of the dead, held by the Aldor, Ezekiel of Shattrath.10229This tome appears to be some sort of history written in a secret Alliance cipher.  Althen, the historian in Spinebreaker Post, has studied the Unyielding for some time; he may be able to crack the Alliance code and decipher the book.10230Perhaps we have taken the wrong approach to the Unyielding? The tome tells me the Expedition Armory was destroyed by orcs and death knights long ago.  The Unyielding remain here as vengeful spirits trapped in an eternal battle against the fel orc clans.  They think only of revenge.  We must arrange for them to defeat their most hated enemies.  Enter the Expedition Armory once again and find Lieutenant Commander Thalvos.  He carries a battle horn that can summon the Unyielding.  Bring it to me.10231Ramdor? Hrm, let me think... Ramdor... Oh yes, the death priest. What does he want with the book? Well it doesn't matter. Yes I lied to you and no I don't have the book. Not anymore, anyway. It was stolen. Probably by one of those filthy refugees.Besides, Auchindoun is now defunct. We have no use for the book. If you find it, you can keep it.Like I said, I saw some of those ruffians snooping around the terrace last week. Start your search with them. They're probably playing dice in the slums.10232The Burning Legion has moved in on our claim at the Scrap Field down the path and across the bridge to the east.This could be a huge problem for us!  With the Legion at the Arklon Ruins, and now there, it's starting to look bad for us - and the rocket project - here at Area 52., I need you to go out there and deal with those demons!  I'd do it, but I'm a lover, not a fighter.Yep, this is going to be trouble, I can feel it!10233Ridding Sunfury Hold of its garrison is not sufficient to keep the blood elves from reoccupying it. Kael'thas's followers are zealous and tenacious. Leaving them anything to use at Sunfury is effectively an invitation to return.No, it must all be destroyed. See to it that their tents and artillery burn to ashes!Steal torches from the Sunfury flamekeepers to accomplish your task, .10234You look like a capable young !  I was wondering if you could lend me a hand?To the east is the Scrap Field, which the Burning Legion has moved into.  It's full of huge fel reaver parts.  There're also a whole bunch of smaller parts in there that they don't seem to care about.I want you to get in there and get me a lot of those smaller fel reaver parts!10235You know what might just discourage them?  Take out their leader!It seems to work everywhere else from what I've heard.  And when they see a  , such as yourself take out their leader... why, I bet they'll tuck tail and run for the hills!Get back in there and take out the big one they call Doomclaw.  I hear he keeps himself in the eastern part of the Scrap Field underneath the pipe.Bring me his claw, too!  Maybe we can make use of it.10236I can't believe I left Booty Bay to come to Outland.  My cousin Screed Luckheed promised me I would make a fortune, but instead he flew off in his zeppelin and left me here to try to scrape a living out of this mine.  How am I suppose to make a living here with helboars and demons and fel orcs attacking all the time?  My shredder here was broken yesterday and the parts I need to fix it were stolen by fel orcs.  They took the parts into the fissure to the southwest and may have dropped them there.10237, you have to get word back to Area 52 immediately!  Hurry!Tell the rocket-chief that the Burning Legion is after us now!10238Why would fel orcs steal my shredder parts?  I hate them so much.  They just sneak into my camp here and take things all the time.  A couple of days ago they stole three of my peons!  Now the rest of my peons have run off because they are afraid they are going to be eaten by fel orcs.  I can't run a mine without peons.  If you could save the peons that I lost maybe the others would come back.  The fel orcs have their camps along the wall to the southwest.10239We are not the only ones battling the influx of the mana beings. The blood elves, too, are troubled by them, but I'm not sure why.Whatever they're involved in over there, they don't seem to be stopping. Instead, I've seen them employ a variety of methods to kill the creatures. The most effective involves magical defenses fueled by some sort of concentrated energy.Capture some of these energy sources and bring them to me. Don't hesitate to stymie the elves if an opportunity presents itself.10240We are prepared to try to construct a perimeter around the village using the energy source taken from the blood elves. I can't guarantee that it will work, but we have to attempt it.Otherwise, the mana creatures will surely continue devouring the spirits of the fallen Kirin Tor.Use this device at the small runes around the perimeter of town to release the energy there. If I've woven the field correctly, we should start noticing a difference once you've used the device at each point.10241We were sent here by the Sha'tar to investigate the manaforges that Kael'thas' army is operating here.  Unfortunately, the Scryers threaten to renege on their information-gathering duties unless we support them with military action.We can't afford to compromise this mission over politics, so we've agreed to weaken the manaforge's defenses so that the Scryers can do their work.Prove your loyalty to the Aldor and slay the Sunfury magisters and bloodwarders that guard Manaforge B'naar.10242, my equipment here is, unfortunately, not configured for all the tests I'd like to perform.  However, my colleague at Spinebreaker Post, Apothecary Albreck, possesses the required implements.I have acquired a sample of Bleeding Hollow blood -- gained from a past mission of Thrallmar's agents.  Take the sample to Albreck and allow him to study it.To reach Spinebreaker Post, speak with Wing Commander Brack, near the wyverns to the south.10243The Scryers obtained a personnel roster for Manaforge B'naar and are now having a field day picking out assassination targets.They've missed one small bit of information, scribbled on the side of the roster.  It appeared to be a password or code like those used to access naaru-made technology like the Exodar or Tempest Keep.Go inside the manaforge and look for a control panel.  Copy its readouts on this scroll as well as you can.  We must confirm our suspicions about the origin of the technology.10245You try to transcribe the shapes as you see them flash across your eyes.  The results are less than exact, but should serve as adequate evidence to prove or disprove the Aldor's suspicions.10246Your success at Manaforge B'naar was quite noteworthy.  I'm sure that Anchorite Karja will ask you for a repeat performance at Manaforge Coruu next.We've learned of a particularly important regiment of Sunfury arcanists and researchers being deployed there and I would like you to target them.  Succeed and you will deliver a crushing blow against our enemy's forces.10247On the outskirts of town to the east are the Proving Grounds.  Our top experimentalist, Doctor Vomisa, has been toying with a combination of fel reaver, ethereal, and of course, goblin technologies there.This is in no small part thanks to your gathering efforts Junior Technician 3rd Grade, !Go to him; I know that he'll have a solution for saving Area 52.And since he's likely to use you as a test subject, if I were you, I'd bring some friends along just in case.10248Doctor Vomisa, Ph.T. at your service.  Here, take this controller.  I want you to activate it and give my newly-invented Scrap Reaver X6000 a spin.Just stay nearby!  The controller is tied to my console here, and if you get too far away, the robot will cease to function.Try out everything... I'll be watching and calibrating its servos based upon your test run.10249I'm certain that the rocket-chief is going to want to have a word or two with you!If I were you, I wouldn't hesitate to get back to Area 52 and speak with him!10250East of here is an old destroyed Alliance siege tower.  Now scavengers loot it for old nails and bits of scrap.  Long ago, many Alliance warriors lost their lives at this tower and their banner was captured by Urtrak, a foul orc commander.Blow the Unyielding battle horn near the Alliance banner.  This will get the attention of Urtrak.  It may also summon forth warriors who fell in battle long ago.10251A couple of draenei paid us a visit last night. They'd somehow learned that we had the book in our possession and made a very generous offer to \"take it off our hands.\"We didn't ask them what they wanted with the book but the young one kept talking about \"the master's grand design,\" whatever that means.Look, I don't ask questions when money is in play. They gave us a lot of gold and we gave them the book.He said that they lived in Nagrand - in the old Abandoned Armory, north of Telaar.10252It has already begun. Levixus stands atop the ruins of Auchindoun and reads from the book of the dead. He calls the dead out by name and, through demonic ritual, binds the tortured souls to his will. He will raise all of Auchindoun if given the chance!But... you must first prepare. You cannot do battle with that which you cannot see.Bring me the items I require to brew the tincture. It will open your mind and allow you to see into the spirit world.10253Go now, . You will find Levixus on the uppermost ruins of Auchindoun. Enter there from the southern reaches of the Bone Wastes. He stands amidst a storm of souls...Destroy him and take the book of the dead. Once you have the cursed book in your possession, destroy it! Destroy it so that such an atrocity can never again be made possible.10254Well, time to earn your pay. Report at once to Force Commander Trollbane within the keep. He and his advisors will no doubt be heartened to see you.For the Alliance!10255I think there's something we can use in the blood as the base of an antidote. Don't look at me like I've lost my mind!It's a common theme in nature. Often, the cure for something can be derived from the toxin itself. That's just what I aim to do.Ridding the boars of their demonic influence would probably eliminate their aggression and give us insight into how to best attempt to help other species.10256In retrospect, I suppose I should've expected Kael'thas's magic to be this robust. He's always been a talented mage, but I've never seen anything like the power he wielded during the attack on the tower.The ward keeps me from being able to scry out the force holding it in place, but it doesn't preclude you from scrying.You'll require a focus, though. A crystal-bearing giant named Apex roams the plains to the west of Manaforge Duro. One of its crystals would make an excellent scrying focus.10257It doesn't surprise me that Kael'thas has put the key to this ward in the hands of someone like Commander Sarannis. Prince Kael'thas is a great many things, but he is no simpleton.In order to break this curse once and for all, you must enter Tempest Keep and claim the keystone.Only once the keystone has been destroyed will I regain my freedom.10258Hogarth, the commander of the Armory, is in the eastern tower.  You must report your victory over Urtrak to him.  Perhaps he will be friendly?  Of course he may try to consume your soul.  One can never tell with spirits such as these. The Unyielding are still against us and will no doubt kill you if they can.  Be careful .10261WANTED:  1 Annihilator Servo to replace the failing one in my Long Neck Spectrum Analyzer.You and your friends might want to check with the blood elves at Manaforge B'naar to the west to see if they have any spares.  They seem to have a few arcane annihilators roaming about.Please deliver the servo in pristine condition to Papa Wheeler at Area 52.10262There is something else that I want your help with.A group of ethereals, known as the Zaxxis, have cut their relationship with the Consortium and gone into business for themselves.  They've even cut deals with the Sunfury blood elves.  This will not be tolerated!I infiltrated their group at the Heap to the south.  But after I took out their leader, I had to escape here to Area 52., go down there and bring back their insignias.  Of course, not all wear them because they're cowards.10263The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things.Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured.There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals.  As a representative of the Aldor, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can.10264The naaru of Shattrath City have been trying to find a means to bring the Consortium over to their way of seeing things.Luck would have it that the business relationship between the ethereals and the blood elves of the Netherstorm has recently soured.There's a Consortium representative in town named Nether-Stalker Khay'ji who recently ran into trouble with a pack of renegade ethereals.  As a representative of the Scryers, I would like for you to help him in any way that you can.10265Our leader, Nexus-Prince Haramad, has tasked me with the acquisition of a crystal artifact from the Arklon Ruins to the southeast.They're old draenei ruins.  Unfortunately for both myself and the goblins here, the Burning Legion has decided to move in to perform their own excavation.If you're willing to help me, go to the ruins and take the crystal artifact from the dreadlord named Pentatharon.10266While you were at the Arklon Ruins, I received a request for assistance from one of our representatives out in the field.  It would appear that the Consortium is having some 'difficulties' in trying to recover property from the blood elves, which they refuse to pay for.Please head east out of Area 52 and cross the bridge to the next island over.  You'll find my associate, Gahruj, at the Midrealm Post, just inside of Eco-Dome Midrealm.10267Our business relations with the blood elves appear to be at an end.  A few weeks ago a large shipment of surveying equipment was delivered to them at Manaforge Duro.  They have refused to pay for it., I would ask that you pay the blood elves of Manaforge Duro to the east a visit.  They appear to be having some trouble with an infestation of mana creatures there, so take advantage of their preoccupation.I care not what happens to them, but I would very much like to see the return of our property.10268Nexus-Prince Haramad has conveyed to me that he is interested in the immediate return of this property to him personally.  I would greatly appreciate if you would deliver it in my stead.It is a great honor to gain an audience with the nexus-prince, and I am sure that he would be keenly interested in hearing the tales of your adventures here in the Netherstorm.Seek out his chamber atop the Stormspire to the north.  He is often present as a holographic image, which you may address.10269There is another reason for the retrieval of the surveying equipment.  There is a crystal from draenei legend of great importance to me.It is said that the crystal bestows god-like powers to its bearer!  But it is in danger of being unearthed by others - namely the Burning Legion., take the equipment and use it to find the first triangulation point.  We know it to be somewhere to the east near Manaforge Ultris.Afterward, check-in with my agent, Dealer Hazzin, on the Manaforge Ultris island.10270From the look on your face, I can tell you're a  who appreciates a good profit.I've built a reputation as a dealer in exotic goods, and I'm about to launch a new venture.I need a reliable subcontractor to procure the goods from the Celestial Ridge.First, you'll need to re-energize a teleport pad. There is a spare power pack in Access Shaft Zeon, which is on the south side of Manaforge UItris. The Protectorate is operating in there, so you may be able to follow their tracers to your goal.10271As you've no doubt seen, the area is teeming with nether dragons in various stages of growth. All nether dragons, young and old, contain an essence that's highly desired by K -- err, by a client of mine.Most people aren't willing to risk their lives to gather it, so we've got the place to ourselves. You can start by gathering the essence from any of the creatures out here, but it's imperative that we start building a supply right away. Return to me once you have the first batch.10272We've come here to investigate rumors of a strange breed of dragons, perhaps even descendents of Deathwing himself. These are clearly not ordinary black dragons, though.We'll know more once we've had a chance to examine their eggs. Their hatred for my flight runs deep, so I can't get close enough to gather the eggs. Will you agree to help?10273Your former employer, Wind Trader Marid, must've gotten wind that you're helping us now. Through my projection, I've seen his nether-stalkers entering the area, hoping to track us down.We've been able to evade them so far, but Marid must be dealt with before the problem grows more severe.If your impressions of Marid are correct, he'll do just about anything to secure the supply of his product. Return to him and tell him you're prepared to offer a deal. Lure him away and slay him.10274The nether dragons have the same ferocious temperament as their black dragon forbears, but there is something entirely alien about them. They hatch and mature rapidly, harnessing the strange energies that forged their kind in the destruction of Draenor.There is so much more I need to know about them, but I believe the powers may be of use to my own flight. If we can displace the leader of these drakes, Veraku, with a show of dominance, we can cow the rest of them into submission.10275I've recalibrated the triangulation device with the information that you provided from the first point.  You'll use it in exactly the same manner to discover the second.All that I can tell you is that the second point is somewhere far to the west.Once you've located it, speak with Wind Trader Tuluman; another of the nexus-prince's agents.  He's posing as a weapon merchant at a small trading post next to the bridge, which leads to the island that Manaforge Ara is on.10276With the data from both the first and second points, I'm now certain that the crystal is at the top of the Ruins of Farahlon to the northeast.Unfortunately, the data indicates that the crystal is moving, which means that it has already been discovered, probably by the Burning Legion!Just in case, I recommend that you take some friends along.Slay the demon that has the crystal and return it to Nexus-Prince Haramad.10277Greetings, . Please follow the custodian. She will make things a bit more... clear.10278Long have I wandered through Outland, searching for the truth of the void.  Now I am old and weak.  Perhaps you will help me? I must learn the secrets of the voidwalkers.  You must find the Warp Fields to the west.  West of the Expedition Armory there is a dark place on the edge of the abyss where time and space are weak.  Use my unstable warp rift generator in the Warp Fields to create a warp rift.  You must gather warp nether from the creatures that come through.10279Ah, . We have been expecting you. Please, allow one of my brothers to fly you down to the master. He awaits you below...10280I am an ethereal of my word, .  You have truly inspired me.I am now going to give you the ata'mal crystal to hand over to the naaru.  As it was your heroics that made this possible, I wish for you to deliver it.You may use my personal teleporter to go directly to Shattrath City.  Simply step through it and you will be transported there.Give the crystal to the naaru known as A'dal on the Terrace of Light.  May the trade winds be at your back.10281Greetings, . Do not be alarmed. This is merely a projection of my current form. It's the only way my companion and I could keep watch without revealing ourselves.The ethereal who approached you, Marid, is little better than a swindler in the guise of a legitimate merchant. I'd like you to consider working with me instead. My purpose out here is to find out more about the unusual dragonkin on this ridge. Meet me at the north end of the ridge and we will discuss this further.10282To the west is the timeway to Hillsbrad of the past - 7 years to be exact.Forces are working against the Horde warchief, Thrall, attempting to prevent him from ever escaping Durnholde Keep.If Thrall never escapes, this world - as you know it - will cease to exist.Gather a group of adventurers and take the timeway to old Hillsbrad. Two of our agents await you inside.Speak with Erozion on the other side.10286Arelion's journal does not deal with any sort of scholarly studies.  It details his escapades with a young female blood elf!  How could I've been such a fool?Unfortunately, the floozy's identity is not revealed in this journal.  Aledis, a colleague of Arelion's, was his best friend and confidant.  Go question him and find out who he was having this affair with.I saw Aledis leave Falcon Watch for Zangarmarsh.  Follow the road headed north from town; it'll eventually lead west, toward Zangarmarsh.10287I'm Arelion's friend, but I'm not going to take the beating of my life for him.  His mistress is Viera Sunwhisper.Go tell that harpy of a wife of his.  What's she going to do anyway?10288I want you to speak with Amish Wildhammer, standing about 30 paces south of us, and catch the first flight to Honor Hold. When you arrive at Honor Hold, you'll be greeted by Marshal Isildor. I have prepared a report detailing our situation here.  Give him the report, and tell him you're ready for duty.You have your orders, soldier, now move out!  And though your blood must be burning to help us against the fiends below, waste no time here.  Honor Hold needs you even more.10289When you're ready, I'll summon a wyvern to fly you to Thrallmar. Once you arrive, deliver Orion's report to General Krakork.Lok'tar ogar,  - good luck.10290To the northeast is an area called the Netherstone, a landmark not seen when this was a lush, green land. Newly-exposed crystal formations have shown us a mineral we've called farahlite in honor of this land's former identity.The tiny amount of farahlite we've mined has already proven popular with our clients. The highest grade of the mineral comes not from static deposits, but from the giants around the Netherstone. I can offer you a cut of the profits if you'll help supply the higher grade farahlite.10291Though our warriors are without peer, our hold on this wasteland is still tenuous. Report to Nazgrel inside the barracks - he has need of agents... such as you. If we can't protect our holdings here, we'll be of no use to anyone. Now go!10293Now that we've got a good baseline product, we're going to need something of higher quality. Certainly the farahlite we've gathered so far is nice, but I know there's better out there.We'll have to get a sample directly from Cragskaar, the patriarch of the Farahlon giants! You should be able to find it among the other giants in the Netherstone area. It's got huge pieces of farahlite jutting from its back and that's exactly what we need. Fell the giant and collect a farahlite core from it.10294We have to improve my warp rift generator.  You must take it to Void Ridge.  Head east of here.  You must avoid the foul fort of Zeth'Gor.  To the east beyond Zeth'Gor is a small pass through the mountains.  Through this pass you will find Void Ridge, a terrible place on the edge of the abyss.You must kill the walkers that you find there, and bring me shards of their souls.  With their power we will improve upon the warp rift generator and open a portal to the beyond that cannot be closed.10295My warp rift generator is complete. You can now use it to summon a true prince of the void, a creature whose soul shard will tell us much of what lies beyond.  Go south in Void Ridge and use my warp rift generator near the void stones.  Look for a cluster of crystals near the edge of the abyss.  A huge warp rift will form and Void Baron Galaxis will surely appear.  Destroy this creature and bring me his soul shard.10296The Infinite Dragonflight have abandoned all pretense of subtlety. They plot to destroy the Guardian, Medivh, and prevent the Dark Portal from ever opening. While outwardly, this may appear a boon to the forces of the Alliance, it is in actuality catastrophic and will result in your world ending.You must venture through the timeway leading to the Black Morass. Go west and then south, past my future self, until you reach the tunnel that houses the swamp specimens. Cross over and speak with Sa'at.10297Beyond this timeway the Guardian, Medivh, feverishly works to open the Dark Portal.Scattered across the morass, rifts will materialize. Infinite will pour out of the rifts and attempt to destroy Medivh's shields and, ultimately, Medivh.Kill their rift lords and leaders! Do this until Medivh succeeds.10299We cannot shut down the manaforges by force as we'd risk causing an explosion that would shake Outland to the core.According to your transcription, there is an emergency shutdown that permanently disables the technology - a safety mechanism common in naaru constructs.To perform this procedure you will have to obtain a crystal that will allow you to communicate with the console.  This access crystal is in the possession of an overseer called Theredis according to our information.10300Simply barbaric! Ekkorash must've taken the staff's crystalline headpiece for use in some other trinket, not realizing that it works in concert with the rest of the staff.As long as it remains broken, the staff's power is greatly diminished. With a suitable draenei crystal, I should be able to repair it. I've heard the goblins remarking about the crystals carried by the ghosts at the Enkaat Ruins to the north.10301While I'm glad to have most of Krasus's Compendium back, it's useless without the heliotrope oculus. You see, Krasus was well aware of the sheer power of the spells recorded in the book and took steps to safeguard them from prying eyes.Only a knowledgeable mage can use the oculus to unlock the compendium's secrets.During Kael'thas's attack, one of his lieutenants, Spellreaver Marathelle, looted it and took it to Sunfury Hold northeast of the tower. No doubt she thought it a pretty little bauble.10302The irradiated power cores from the Exodar have been wreaking havoc on the environment here. The most obvious effect has been the appearance of the strange creatures that seem to have sprung up near them.There may be something we can do to help them, but now, their sheer numbers are becoming too much for us to handle.I'd like you to go out and cull their numbers somewhat, and perhaps I'll have another idea after giving it some thought.10303You must eliminate... the blood elf... threat.  Find out... what they're... up to!They're on the... ridge behind me.10304With your help, we were able to find a solution to our problems faster than I could have hoped.I don't have any other work for you to do. My apprentices and I can handle the rest.You should go speak with Vindicator Aldar on the other side of the ship.10305This worn, sturdy tome is no spellbook, as you might expect a Kirin Tor mage to carry. The pages of the volume are covered with hand-copied stories, accompanied by colorful illustrations.The tome seems to be far older than its former owner and may have even been a family heirloom. A powerful tie to the book may have been the last thread tying Belmara's spirit to the ruins of Kirin'Var. Returning it to its proper place on the bookshelf in her quarters might help appease her restless spirit.10306The cloak, undoubtedly of high elven craftsmanship, is richly tailored, even by the standards of the Kirin Tor. The symbols and characters sewn into the cloak's fabric hold no meaning for you, but clearly imbue the garment with magical properties.Perhaps this object binds the spirit of its former owner to this plane of existence. If so, returning it to the dresser in Conjurer Luminrath's quarters might break the spirit's link to this world, allowing it to rest.10307Looking at the hat, you find yourself asking if any Kirin Tor mage would own such headgear. Judging from the hat's wear, it seems the gnome wouldn't go anywhere without it.You try on the hat momentarily, discovering no magical properties beyond a faint urge to dance.The treasured possession might be the source of the dead mage's bond to the village. Placing the hat in the footlocker in Cohlien's quarters might free his spirit.1030810309You see that scrapped fel reaver over there to the south?  Isn't it a thing of beauty?I want its heart!What?  Yes, of course it has a heart... what doesn't?Go on over there, pry it open, bring back what I want and I'll give you a nice finder's fee in return.Oh, and I'd take a friend or two along if I were you.  These Zaxxis ethereals are a pretty mean bunch!Take this fel zapper to jumpstart its heart when you're ready to begin.10310With the Burning Legion nearby at the fel reaver scrap field, we must do what we can to stop the flow of demons into the area.They have a warp-gate to the south in an area that they've cleverly named Invasion Point: Destroyer.I need you to go with me to the site and keep me safe while I sabotage it.Afterward, go to the Midrealm Post to the north inside Eco-Dome Midrealm and apprise Gahruj of our success.We're going to need a friend or two of yours along to help with this.10311, it is good to see a helpful face around here.The Burning Legion at the nearby fel reaver heap has become more bold, and I am beginning to fear for our safety here.  The demons are constantly receiving reinforcements from Invasion Point: Destroyer to the south.My compatriot, Drijya, has gone down there to scout and see if he can do something about the Burning Legion's warp-gate.Please find and assist him in any way that you can.10312Silencing the spirits has not bled them of their aggression as we had hoped it would. The malevolent spirits you subdued have reemerged in the streets of the town.We must uncover what is causing this to happen. The destruction of Kirin'Var was just the beginning, or else the spirits would have been quieted by now.The town hall in the southern section of Kirin'Var maintained a logbook of all the residents. Last I heard, it was in the keeping of Battle-Mage Dathric. Perhaps his spirit still has it.10313If our instincts are right and these manaforges have been made using technology from Tempest Keep, then all of Outland could be in grave danger.Tempest Keep's energy-recharging mechanisms were never supposed to be used this close to the land.  The warp energies are capable of destroying this very land, even when contained within Kael's pipelines.Take this orb to Manaforge B'naar; it is attuned to measure warp energies.  Use it at the pipelines' ends, where they go into the earth.10314The strange magical device resembles nothing you've ever seen before. It's certainly not of blood elf manufacture.As you sense spirits moving closer to the building, the orb glows with a greater intensity, which fades as the spirits leave. There's no question that it plays a role in the corruption of the ghosts.How it works remains a mystery. Perhaps Custodian Dieworth will have some insight if you can provide the remains of some of the spirits along with your observations.10315The blood elves are fools!  I'm glad that our trade relations with them have fallen apart.  In all of my travels throughout the cosmos, I have never encountered beings so selfish.They continue to destroy the land around us with their manaforges, so let's see if we can put a dent in their operations across the bridge at Manaforge Ara.Their nethermancers channel energy to and from the blood gems to stabilize the flow of power.  Go over there and wipe them out!10316Whoever is behind the transformation of the spirits has been very deliberate in their actions, taking care to target the most powerful mages first, but why? The kind of magic required to influence the spirits of slain Kirin Tor mages must be very powerful.Why would a powerful mage go to all this trouble? I'm inclined to say this is another plot of Kael'thas's, designed to cause more misery here. If there are blood elves here, they're likely to be hiding in the houses across the covered bridge.10317The blood elves call the mine underneath Manaforge Ara the Trelleum Mine.  Ever since they lost the one underneath Manaforge Ultris, this is where their sole supply of material for running the forges is coming from.Needless to say, it would be a boon for us to cripple their mining operation.  Perhaps we'd even be able to move in and take it over for ourselves?Whatever the case, I want you to go in there and deal with Foreman Sundown.  The mine is around the back of the island to the left.10318I used to be the foreman here.  But now that I've been demoted, I've come to realize our pilgrimage from Quel'Thalas to Outland was all a lie.A lie perpetrated by Kael'thas to strengthen his forces here in the Netherstorm.I've tried to convince my brethren that we should leave, especially with the Burning Legion here, but they are all too stubborn.Do me a favor?  Kill Overmaster Grindgarr.  Then return to your ethereal and tell him that I am no longer his enemy.10319I suppose an explanation is in order. You've met one of the archmage's apprentices, Ravandwyr, but there was also another named Naberius.He was an ardent student, but was drawn to necromancy. When Kael'thas appeared with his forces, Naberius seized the opportunity to betray the archmage, handing over the secrets to the tower's defense.Now, it seems, he has become a lich. If we are to stop him, we must capture his phylactery. Knowing him, he would've buried it somewhere out of sight in his domain.10320Archmage Vargoth saw the danger in Naberius's pursuit of necromancy, but I don't think he ever anticipated that his own apprentice would wreak this much destruction upon the Kirin Tor.You must defeat him, , or else he will continue enslaving the spirits of our fallen brothers, robbing them of their rightful rest and destroying what little remains of Kirin'Var.With his phylactery in hand, he can be confronted by two or three combatants, but who knows what his magic might do to more foes?10321Your success at B'naar has given us a great deal of hope, .We've shared our discoveries with the Scryers and in return they've given us more information on the remaining manaforges.Three other manaforges still stand, in full control of the Sunfury army.You will find Manaforge Coruu to the east.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal there.  Obtain it and use it on the manaforge's control console to begin the emergency shutdown.We're all counting on you, .10322We've received news from one of the two manaforges that remain operational.  The Sunfury army is losing control of Manaforge Duro.Droves of errant mana creatures have been attracted to it by its increased energy production - the manaforge is in chaos.An explosion at Duro has the potential to cause a chain reaction that would endanger all of Outland.  Overseer Athanel is in possesion of the access crystal you need to safely disable the manaforge.10323One manaforge is all that keeps Tempest Keep functional.  After we bring Manaforge Ara down, Kael will have to resort to depleting whatever energy he's got stored up.Travel to Manaforge Ara, in the northwest, and deliver the final blow that we need by shutting it down.The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad.  Be warned that we expect heavy opposition in the last of Kael's functional manaforges.  You're likely to need the assistance of reliable friends.10324Well done, ! Well done!Now that you've cut your teeth with the moongraze stag, it's time you graduated to more formidable prey. Do not allow the casual disinterest of the moongraze bucks to fool you: when provoked, they are a fearsome foe.You'll find the bucks north of here. Good hunting.10325As you probably know, , the Aldor are keepers of the Light and servants of the naaru.Diametrically opposed to us are the agents of the Burning Legion - demons bent on the destruction of worlds and the corruption of the innocent.If you wish to prove yourself to the Aldor, bring me the insignias of low-ranking Legion and their Shadow Council followers.  We know of a Shadow Council hideout in the Bone Wastes and there are many Legion outposts in Nagrand and the Blade's Edge Mountains.103261032710328Something about these manaforges has been bothering me, .  Naaru technology is incredibly advanced; it should've taken Kael'thas years to even begin to understand it.Information-gathering on the subject has been difficult as Kael's army is well disciplined and destroys all evidence of written communication.We've been informed Manaforge Duro is under attack by mana creatures.  It is possible that those defending it have not yet destroyed their briefings.  Obtain them and bring them to me.10329I was having a friendly discussion with the Aldor while you were gone.  Manaforges sure look like modified naaru technology from Tempest Keep.  Apparently, most naaru constructs have certain safeguards that allow them to be permanently disabled in case of emergency.The procedure is usually initiated at a control console via an access crystal.  Lo and behold, according to the roster you secured, such a crystal is in the possession of a fellow called Overseer Theredis.  Obtain it and see what you can do.10330Thalodien told us of your success in disabling Manaforge B'naar.  He expects a repeat performance here and asked us to keep an eye out for anyone using a crystal to access the console inside.  Overseer Seylanna holds the access crystal, we're sure of it.Go back in there and finish the operation.  No need to be stealthy anymore; get the crystal, begin the shutdown, kill the technicians trying to stop you and get out.Hurry, it won't be long before Kael's lapdogs sniff us out.10331You haven't seen a heavy smithing hammer lying around by chance, have you? I brought it out here with me to finish the shoes for some of old man Amorlin's horses, but I can't find it.I've searched the barn no less than a half dozen times and I just can't seem to find it. Maybe one of the other apprentices retrieved it and took it back to the smithy? Would you be willing to go down there and take a look? The workshop is to the southeast of the tower in the Town Square.10332At last, my journeyman project is complete! I can't wait to formally present it to Master Rhonsus.They attacked you? All of them? By the Light, they've gone mad!What are we to do, ? It grieves me to say so, but it may be necessary to kill Master Rhonsus. It would leave me as the only smith in Kirin'Var, but I believe my training is sufficient to serve the town's needs.10333Say, , I was wondering if you could do me another favor.My partner out in the field could probably use a hand.  I was wondering if you could go check in on her.I'm sure that Mama Wheeler will appreciate the help.  Just don't mind her sharp tongue.She's trying to look out for our interests to the east.  You'll find her just inside Eco-Dome Midrealm at the Midrealm Post.10334Where, oh where has my Bessy gone? After the attack, I searched the fields and the Chapel Yard for her, but she was nowhere to be seen!All I have left of her is this old cowbell. She usually comes running when she hears it, but these feeble old bones probably couldn't shake it hard enough.I'll loan you Bessy's bell if you're willing to go out to the fields and ring it as hard as you can. Perhaps all Bessy's waiting for is a little more cowbell.10335I have to get over to the Ruins of Farahlon to start my excavations!  The problem is that the place has been infested by demons!Maybe you could do some preliminary work for me?There are three locations within the ruins to the northeast where I want you to place surveying markers.  Each is near a draenei banner.Return to me when you've managed to place all three markers.10336A few weeks ago, the Burning Legion moved into the Ruins of Farahlon, thwarting our plans to excavate the site for its artifacts.Then earlier today, I learned that one of their dreadlords, Culuthas, somehow killed off all of the other Burning Legion.  He has since summoned in demons that serve him., I want you to go up to those ruins to the northeast and rid them of their demon infestation.10337Realizing that Bessy is still staring at you, you gesture toward Thadell's location. You find yourself promising to protect the cow on her way home. Upon finishing your sentence, you realize there's no possible way the cow could understand anything you've said.Shrugging your shoulders, you prepare to guard the bovine on her way back to Thadell.10338So Manaforge Duro is under attack and Sunfury forces have lost control?  What a dilemma!  If Duro goes down, then Tempest Keep goes down.  Only drawback is... if Tempest Keep is destroyed, the explosion will probably take what little remains of this forsaken land with it.Dead Kael'thas is good.  Dead everyone else is... not that great, I suppose.  It pains me to ask this of you, but go to Manaforge Duro and shut it down before it goes up in flames.  The access crystal is held by Overseer Athanel.10339Directly south of here you will find the Ethereum Staging Grounds. The Ethereum are there, preparing for something... Perhaps an assault on Ultris.We can't take any chances, though, . Break through their perimeter defenses and take out their training facility.Once you've destroyed their soldiers and Captain Zovax, locate Ethereum transponder Zeta and use it to establish contact with me to get your next set of orders.10340, you've done a great job here at the front, and you showed a lot of talent with that armored gryphon... I think I have another mission in mind for you.This new mission launches from Shatter Point -- an attack base the Wildhammers set up on a floating piece of land near the Portal.  It's a little unnerving there, but you have tough guts.  You'll be fine.Talk to Wing Commander Dabir'ee and have him send you to Shatter Point.  From there, report to the gryphon master Runetog Wildhammer.10341The news you've discovered is fortunate, .  Not only do you get to waltz into Manaforge Duro unfettered, this also presents a great opportunity to deal a blow to Kael's army.Use the mana creature assault to your advantage and pick off any Sunfury stragglers you run into.I do not take particular glee in the senseless slaughter of my own kin the way that Thalodien does, but the tactical advantage here is too high to pass up.10342I make a good living selling drinks to the boozehounds around here.  But I want something more!The rocket-chief is always telling me how he can't perfect the rocket fuel needed to get the X-52 off of the ground.We can solve that little problem for him.For starters I need to extract the oil from the shale of the local shaleskin flayers!  It'll form a concentrated, if explosive, base for the mix that I have in mind.Find the flayers, and their shale, all over the place near the purple rocks.10343Kael'thas's assault on Kirin'Var began with thundering noise and a bright flash of light in the officer quarters to the northwest. The destruction there was the most severe and after the withdrawal of the blood elves, a strange thing began to happen.Beings of pure mana began streaming into the village from all over the area. For now, we're containing them as we can, but with more information about the weapon Kael'thas used, I hope to cut off the flow of mana creatures entirely.10344Wing Commander Gryphongar runs this outfit of Wildhammers.  If this is your first time to Shatter Point, then you should report to him.You'll find him inside what's left of that tower over yonder.10345You see these corpses, ? Arconus is responsible for this slaughter. He's sucked them dry, leaving nothing more than a fleshy husk. But don't let the bodies fool you! Inside those corpses lie flesh beasts, waiting to pounce on the unsuspecting fool that gets too close.I've got my orders. I must remain here until backup arrives. That doesn't mean that you can't take my igniter and destroy the withered corpses that litter the mines. One way or another, the mission must be completed.10346, you've proven yourself as a capable gryphon rider, and we could use you on more sorties over the Abyssal Shelf.  What say you, ?  Do you want some more flight time?10347, are you ready for another sortie over the Abyssal Shelf?  I fear that, if we do not maintain pressure on the Legion forces there and allow them to strengthen their hold, then we may suffer a large demon attack from the north.What say you, ?  Do you want to take another windrider and hammer the Abyssal Shelf one more time?10348I hear that a group of 'druids' from Azeroth has taken quite an interest in the effects of our eco-dome technology.The Cenarion Expedition's representatives are eager to get access to the plants growing within the domes, particularly one called the ivory bell, known for its healing properties. They're found in clumps of brush around larger plants in Eco-Dome Midrealm.I'll share the profits with you if you're willing to gather the herbs for my first delivery.10349You should take the crystal lump over to the earthbinder.  She's just like you... always needing to get to the bottom of a mystery and thinking all of the time.If you ask me, she thinks a little too much.Just give it to her and I'm sure that she'll get you into a heap of trouble figuring out what is going on up there on the ridge.10350While you have learned many hard lessons from me during our time together, it is time that I entrusted you to wiser hands.Behomat, who trained me when I was as green as grass, will be your new teacher. I have told him that you will be seeking him out, and he is expecting you.You will find him at the center of the Warriors' Terrace, at the highest point of the Traders Tier of the Exodar.10351It must be that the evil emanations from that giant crystal are summoning the mountain giants and driving them insane.It's too big to move, and beyond our ability to destroy, but I know a way to quell its power.I've summoned a circle at the northwest corner of the crystal on the ridge.  Take this seed to the circle and channel its powers to heal the land through the natural forces of rain, growth and insect repopulation.Beware, , I sense an external force at play here... this is not natural!10353Araxes and I were deployed to Ultris 2 days ago. Our mission: Find and terminate the void lord Arconus. We tracked him to this mine and discovered that he'd been feeding off the energies of the creatures in the area.A fire-fight broke out which resulted in Araxes and I separating. Now I'm stuck here, badly injured. The mission is in shambles!If you can take out Arconus, high command would be grateful. Should you accept this mission, I will assist by providing a reflection of myself as a guardian.10355We must determine how far the damage has spread. The basidium you brought me comes from a bog giant. Their larger, hardier cousins, the bog lords, should prove more resistant to the degeneration that's struck the giants.It would be good to know how the changes in the Dead Mire have affected the other creatures out there, too.Return to the Dead Mire and see if you can get samples from the bog lords and the hydra in the area.10365You've done much better than any of us anticipated.  Manaforge Ara is the last of Kael's working manaforges.  You'll find it northwest of here, though you're likely to have to do some circumnavigating to get to it.  We want you to shut it down.The last access crystal is in the possession of Overseer Azarad.  This is Kael's very last source of energy as far as we know, so expect heavy opposition.  I'd bring a couple of friends along if I were you.Hmm... Azarad.  What an odd name for a sin'dorei.10367Anywhere you see a tribe of enslaved Broken you will also find a traitor.  A despicable being who sold his brothers for promises of power.There is a hut at the top of the stairs in the center of the ruins.  That's the turncoat's hut.He's not there right now, so you will be able to sneak in if you're patient.  Inside you will find a coffer with a key inside of it.  That key unlocks the chains that keep the Dreghood elders prisoner.  Bring it to me.Beware, Arzeth the Merciless wanders nearby.10368The Dreghood spirit is broken because our elders are imprisoned.  Take this key and go downstairs to free them.They are Morod the Windstirrer, Akoru the Firecaller and Aylaan the Waterwaker.  Once they are free, the spirits will return to the Dreghood tribe.10369Yes, the elemental spirits have returned to us!  We are not as strong as we once were, but a little magic can go a long way in the right hands.Arzeth has great powers bestowed upon him by his dark lord.  Take this staff.  It was once a great symbol of our tribe.  Use it against Arzeth and his powers will be temporarily removed from him.  Defeat him then, so that my people may finally be free!10372Eralan, an associate of mine in Tranquillien, has made an inquiry about securing some help for an urgent job.Now, I don't know what she has in mind because I don't ask questions, but you've proven yourself more than capable. I want you to travel to Tranquillien in the Ghostlands and have a word with Eralan.She may be a bit gruff, but she's trustworthy.10380We've been so blind, , that the alliance of two of our most dangerous enemies went completely unnoticed.I wouldn't be surprised if the Scryers had something to do with hiding this information from us, but we must now face the reality.  The Burning Legion and Kael'thas' Sunfury army serve under the same banner.These demons are the only reason Kael'thas was ever able to utilize the technology in Tempest Keep.  Under Orelis's orders I must command you to destroy them.10381My mission here is finished.  I did what Orelis ordered me to - I've never failed to.No more.  I foresee a great carnage - a crusade, they'll call it - following the news of this alliance between Kael'thas and the Burning Legion.First they give our holiest city away to our enemies and then they ask us to die fighting their enemies.  Go back to Orelis; tell him the naaru can fight their own fights from now on.10382Well, , I hope you're prepared for the next phase of our operation. The Legion never rests - and neither shall we! Take a gryphon and fly over to Honor Point - it's a small post near the Legion Front. Speak with Field Marshal Brock. He'll have instructions for you when you arrive. Oh, and tell that pasty-faced shield-kisser I said 'hello'.10384Look around you, fleshling. Very close to this transponder should be an Ethereum data cell. Locate that data cell, open it, and retrieve the contents.Bring it back to this transponder at once!10385They're using relays to transfer information around the staging grounds.There is only one way for you to see these relays and extract the information they hold. Unfortunately, doing so may cause you irreparable brain damage.If you're still interested, you'll need to slay Ethereum here at the staging grounds and take their essences. Once you have an essence, drink it down. It will temporarily allow you to see an Ethereum relay - giving you enough time to destroy a relay and extract its information.10388Hope you enjoyed your flight, friend. A messenger arrived while you were away - seems Nazgrel's got a new use for you. You'd best head back to Thrallmar and check in with him. I have a feeling the Legion's just getting warmed up.10389Greetings, . I've deciphered the Legion missive and uncovered the demons' strategic plans for this Peninsula. Apparently, there is a large group of hellish terrorfiends gathering near the Pools of Aggonar in the west. We cannot allow such a force to go unchallenged. You must go there and decimate their cursed numbers.10390, we have reason to believe that the easternmost forge camp is not yet complete. The Legion's gan'arg servants are working 'round the clock to get the facility up and running. We can't allow that to happen. Head east to Forge Camp: Mageddon and slay 10 gan'arg. Bring me the head of their master - Razorsaw - and the Legion's fel reaver production will grind to a halt!10391There is a second production facility, Forge Camp: Rage, that lies to the immediate northeast of Thrallmar. The demons have positioned a number of their fel cannons along the ridge - and they're aimed straight at us! You must enter the camp and destroy these fel cannons. , you must be sure to detonate them all - or nothing will stop the Legion from raining fiery hell down upon our heads!10392You are an honor to us, . But now we must strike before the Legion recovers! To the north of Thrallmar lies Invasion Point: Annihilator. It houses a warp-portal through which the Legion draws its reinforcements. You must overload that portal - and blast it back to the abyss it came from. The portal's activation key will be held by the Point's commander - Warbringer Arix'Amal. Slay him. Take the key. Use it on the portal and do what must be done. May the warchief's blessings be with you.10393The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one in Thrallmar that can transcribe such vile script - the blood elf Magister Bloodhawk.10394Pay close attention, . We've been surveying the Legion camps that lie along the ridge ahead. We have reason to believe that these so-called 'Forge Camps' are where the demons are constructing those blasted Fel Reavers. You can see the closest target, Forge Camp: Mageddon, to the west. Our intelligence suggests that it's still under construction. If you can slay the Gan'arg Servants and their master - Razorsaw - we can bring the Legion's Fel Reaver production to a grinding halt!10395The text on the note is written in some dark, indecipherable scrawl. The more you stare at them, the more the symbols seem to twist and burn before your eyes. There is only one at Honor Hold who can decipher such archaic script - the draenei mystic, Kryv. Take the Burning Legion Missive to Warp-Scryer Kryv who resides within the War-Room at Honor Hold.10396Now we focus on the second target - Forge Camp: Rage. It lies just west of Mageddon. Trouble is, the demons have a number of fel cannons aimed straight at the Horde's outpost of Thrallmar! Though I can scarcely believe it, we actually need the Horde to help us hold the line at the Dark Portal. We can't afford to let Thrallmar fall.  You've got to destroy these cannons before the Legion pulverizes our allies!10397Well, we've located the Legion's final base on the ridge - Invasion Point: Annihilator. It lies northwest of Forge Camp: Rage - and it houses a warp-portal through which the Legion has been drawing its reinforcements! You've got to close that portal to prevent any more demons from coming through. The Point's overlord, Warbringer Arix'Amal, holds the portal's activation key. Take it from him and shut that blasted gateway down!10399It is just as I feared. Arix'Amal - the demon you killed earlier, was working for a secret Legionlord - Arazzius the Cruel. It appears this new villain has amassed a force of hellish terrorfiends near the Pools of Aggonar. You must journey there and slay the terrorfiends before they strike against us. But be wary, friend - the Pools of Aggonar lie within a tortured, poisonous valley. You can find the cursed pools to the northwest of here, beyond Hellfire Citadel. Light be with you, .10400The honorable Warp-Scryer has told me of your perils,  - and of the new foe you've discovered. If Kryv is to be believed, this 'Arazzius the Cruel' is as powerful and evil as any foe the Sons of Lothar have ever faced. Will you stand for us now, ? Will you face this Legionlord and deliver the Light's justice upon him? If so, you will find him at the Pools of Aggonar. If not, his evil will most certainly find you.10403Perhaps not all hope is lost for the Dreghood.  I am one of four elders that guided this tribe before we were enslaved by the Illidari.  I thought the others were dead, but I've slowly learned that at least two others are alive - chained down and powerless just as I am.I've not yet been able to find Naladu and fear for the worst.  There are more huts in the ruins upstairs; perhaps you could look for him.  It would be a great boon for our tribe if all our elders were alive.10405We must destroy the machinery that is making these nexus-stalker aberrations possible. To strike at their proto-accelerator would be futile as it is an ethereal creation. We must instead destroy the manaforge energy tube that they are using as a conduit.I have all that I need to create a device to overload the conduit save for one item. I need a wrapping from an archon or overlord that might be transforming soon in order to calibrate the device.10406I'm sending one of my demolitionists out to place the disruption device. Just make sure no harm comes to him as he's placing the disruptor.Keep him protected! He will not fight back if enemies attack him as he is only a holographic image but the image can be destroyed!Return to me once the job is done.10407The infamous eredar, Socrethar, leads the Burning Legion in Netherstorm.  Mentioning his name is enough to make most draenei shudder.  He gives orders from an island in the northwest that only his most trusted lieutenants can access.To get there you will need to obtain a teleportation stone, which won't be an easy task.  The first half of the stone is in the possession of Forgemaster Morug at Forge Base: Oblivion.  The second half is held by Silroth at Forge Base: Gehenna.10408I have in my possession another disruptor, one capable of destroying the three conduits that surround Salhadaar. Once the conduits are destroyed, Salhadaar's protective force fields will be down. For this act, he will strike at you with a ferocity you have never before witnessed, .If you are willing to rid the world of Salhadaar, I will give you the disruptor.10409When facing eredar of great power, large armies are useless for the most part.  Their corruptive powers over mortal souls are such that only the strongest-willed can even stand face to face with them.Take this stone to the Invasion Point: Overlord, between Forge Base: Oblivion and Gehenna and bring your closest, strongest friends with you.  Orelis and Karja will meet you at Socrethar's Seat; I will send Adyen along with them.May the Light prevail today, .  May Socrethar meet his end.10410The time has come to face Socrethar, .  Confronting an eredar leader isn't something that's taken lightly among us.  A single mistake is likely to cost us our lives if we're ill-prepared.Take Socrethar's teleportation stone to High Priestess Ishanah at the Shrine of Unending Light in Shattrath City.  She will determine how we need to handle the situation.10411Around the ruined manaforge you will find the run-off of Dimensius's handy work. Seeping sludge occupies the pools that surround Ultris. Directly below those pools, where the Ethereum Staging Grounds now stand, you will find even more run-off in the form of void waste.The best method of disposal is to use electro-shock to break slimes down to globules. Use this elixir to augment your attacks with electricity. The resultant discharge will break the slimes up into their raw form. Destroy the globules!10412It is no secret that Kael'thas Sunstrider perceives us as a great threat.  Let's face it - not many sin'dorei, fresh from Silvermoon, are willing to join the sort of company that Kael keeps.It's also no secret that this is not just a war of words.  Scryers and the armies that serve Kael'thas attack each other on sight.  The only way to prove you're with us, , is to do your share of fighting.Kael's lower ranking followers wear Firewing signets to indicate their rank.  Bring them to me.10413You carefully fill a vial with the fallen void horror's ooze.Researcher Navuud at the Protectorate Watch Post would be quite interested in such a find! Take it to him at once!104141041510416Arcane tomes are not ordinary books that happen to deal with arcane matters.  There is intrinsic power in them - a power I've learned to synthesize into a single arcane rune.Should you find an arcane tome in your travels I will give you one such rune.  Only the most powerful wielders of magic carry the books I need.  In Outland this usually means Kael's blood elves - but you'd be surprised by where such tomes often turn up.10417Wherever the Consortium establishes a presence, we bring our eco-dome technology. The fields allow us to work in a controlled and life-sustaining atmosphere since we often find ourselves in hostile environments.Netherstorm's volatile conditions and creatures have begun to destroy the equipment that sustains our domes, especially the generator east of here. I've started a diagnostic there in hopes of understanding what can be done to combat the damage. Would you collect the results and bring them to me?10418In searching the area for clues about the damage to our equipment, I've seen pieces of the shield generators at the bottom of the small lake to the north. I'm not sure why the crocolisks have taken an interest in the equipment, but we have to put a stop to this problem.The Consortium is quite clear on this matter. If it comes down to a choice between the equipment and crocolisks, the animals will have to go. I'll make it worth your while to deal with them.1041910420This temple is one of the holiest places in all of Outland.  The power of the Light here is so strong, that even items with the strongest fel taint can be cleansed of a worldly item.Should you run into any fel armaments in your confrontations with demonic enemies, bring them to me and I will demonstrate the cleansing power of the Light.1042110422Captain Tyralius took a platoon of soldiers south towards the Ethereum Staging Grounds 10 days ago. We haven't heard from him or his crew since.Chances are good that they were ambushed and killed but I'm getting a curious reading from my instruments.I think it's a distress signal but these things have been wrong before. If Tyralius is still alive, they're keeping him in one of their prisons. You'll have to locate the prison and open it with a key, probably found on the warden.10423Master Engineer Ghabar will want to know about the results of the diagnostics. If anything, they caution us to keep a close eye on the workings of our dome generators. As the fields become more and more unstable, their effects will become harder to control. It could spell disaster for our expedition and anything else housed within the domes.You'll find Ghabar at the Stormspire. Just follow the road north from this eco-dome and across the bridge. It'll lead you to the elevator at the base of the spire.10424If Mehrdad's results are correct -- and I have no reason to believe they're faulty -- then the rest of the domes could be in trouble.I do think Mehrdad has failed to identify the underlying cause of the failures. From time to time, creatures damage the generators, but never this severely.To be on the safe side, I'd like for you to run a set of diagnostics at the Stormspire's main dome generator, located in Eco-Dome Sutheron at the very eastern edge of the dome.10425Thank K'aresh! He would have torn me apart!I'm a Protectorate soldier, fleshling. My platoon was sent on a recon mission about 10 days ago. As we were moving across the upper ledges of this island, a group of Ethereum jumped us. At least I think it was Ethereum. They had the same energy color but their wrappings looked void.Only Tyralius was spared. I think they put him in a prison cell.I've got to get back to the Protectorate Watch Post! Can you escort me back?10426Just look around you, ! Isn't it amazing? Of course, this incredible resurgence of life is a byproduct of the ethereal domes, but imagine what it could do in the hands of the expedition.I'm preparing to negotiate with the ethereals for access to their technology, but I'd like to get a better idea of its effects on plant-based life.I've built a device to concentrate the dome's energies on the lashers in this area. Would you be so kind as to test it for me and share the results?10427Your work with the lashers turned up some astounding information, but I wonder if it holds true for animals as well.Gathering information on the talbuks that live underneath this dome is going to be trickier than studying the lashers, I'm afraid.Using this tagging device, you can put a weakened talbuk to sleep and apply a tag that I'll use to track the animal as it matures. The tagging mechanism won't work unless the talbuk has expended most of its energy.10428In the fevered dreams of our injured guest, she spoke of a fisherman, Cowlen, who was in some distress at Silvermyst Isle, to the southwest, off the coast of Azuremyst.With all that has been happening, no one has had the opportunity to look into it, but I do feel a bit of worry. Perhaps there's something you can do, ?10429The dome technology possesses such power! Certainly, there are bounds beyond which we dare not go, .Creatures allowed to grow too large or too fast could be just as bad as a barren landscape.I have heard rumors of just such a creature in the pool to the east. I've heard the ethereal merchants conspiring to catch the overgrown hydra for sport, but I have another purpose in mind for the giant. Bring me the creature's heart so I may study it.10430I've been working on a portable generator repair kit for use in some of the harsher climates that the Consortium operates in. Granted, it wasn't designed for Netherstorm, but we shouldn't have any problems with it.I had already scheduled a test with one of my best techs up at Eco-Dome Farfield beyond the Netherstone to the northeast. Take this prototype to Tashar. He'll know what to do with it. If it works, we can use it to reinforce the shield generators at the larger domes.10431The Sunfury briefings support the theory that Kael'thas has been receiving outside help in constructing and running these manaforges.  Who this is remains a bit of a mystery, though we're likely to find out in Manaforge Ara.I've sent a group of my men to scout the surrounding area.  Go to Tuluman's Landing, north of here, and speak to Kaylaan.  See what he's discovered at Manaforge Ara.  Find out who is assisting the Sunfury army and take care of them.10432As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara.  Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion.  He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly.If the Scryers get definite proof of this, it will give them a considerable political advantage.  I know for a fact that the Legion forces at this manaforge have orders that bear Kael's seal.Get these orders and bring them to Thalodien.10433The ethereals are clever and very observant, so it's no accident that I'm here posing as a simple furrier. In fact, I've been sent from Area 52 to appraise the technology the ethereals use to generate their eco-domes.I'd like to enlist your help, . We've been asked to use non-goblin agents whenever possible.What I want you to do is bring me a number of ripfang lynx pelts in the guise of a hunter. You can find the lynxes all over Eco-Dome Midrealm.10434Excellent job.I think they're buying it. Now, when I send you up to speak with my associates at the Stormspire, there won't be any suspicion at all.You'll want to look for Action Jaxon and Audi the Needle up there. They'll tell you everything you need to know. Tell 'em Shauly sent you.10435I'm sure Shauly told you a bit about our work here. When Jaxon and I are out in the field 'hunting,' we've been collecting pieces of the ethereal eco-dome generators and hiding them in the nests of our prey, the raptors in Eco-Dome Farfield.It's a remote area to the northeast of the Stormspire, close to the Netherstone. I don't anticipate you'll run into many ethereals there, but would you be willing to help us collect the dome generator pieces?10436Before we can begin the test, we have to make certain the area is clear of anything that might interfere. In our case, that means these overgrown lizards.There's no telling what might happen if one of those decides to take a nice bite out of the generator while it's charging. I've seen a lot of strange things in all my years as a technician, including more than a few abominations that had their beginnings as humble animals.10437Atop Manaforge Ultris lies the tear in the nether that the void lord, Dimensius, came through. That tear provides Dimensius with a link to the void, rendering him immune to physical harm. If we can get a lock on the conduit that Dimensius is using to keep himself phased out of this plane of existence, we can destroy it and then destroy Dimensius.To do this, we're going to first need you to collect fragments of Dimensius from the void creatures that he sends out to do his dirty work.10438Here it is, . Take this phase disruptor and mount up! The Protectorate nether drake will fly you close enough to Ultris so that you can drop the disruptor on top of the void conduit.Drop as many disruptor charges as possible to ensure complete annihilation!When you are ready, speak with the nether drake and he'll take you up.If you miss the mark you will have to get more bombs from me before you can go up again.10439Your brave actions have forced Ameer to react! He has deployed Captain Saeed and the Avengers!Now all that is left to do is destroy Dimensius.When you are ready, I will call for Saeed. If he is not currently fighting another battle, he will be awaiting orders from you - directly east of here.Let him know when you are ready to fight and he will put his troops in motion!I wish you luck, fleshling! We have hunted Dimensius for a thousand years!10440The test was a resounding success! We can certainly use this device to start repairing the domes.Carry word of the test results to the Stormspire and let Ghabar know that I've also found a pattern in the damage to the shield generators. Key pieces of generator units have gone missing from a number of sites. This is no accident, , no technological failure. We're being stolen from.10442, there's some tauren by the name of Thiah Redmane that keeps pestering us for assistance.

Droggam has my sword and Mugdorg has my shield.If you have need, obtain and use the brew from Bloodmaul Outpost to the south to thin out their help and entice those two, but beware their sober guards who don't drink!10517The leader of Bladespire Hold is known as Gorr'Dim.  Trust me... the name is appropriate.Still, I wouldn't underestimate him.  He's crafty enough to have elevated his clan to be the favorite of Gruul the Dragonkiller and they now dominate these mountains.

Kill the demons here until you find my bow.10538That last experiment was not a complete loss -- I did save a small bit of the blood you brought me.  Now boiled down, it should be free of whatever curses the Bleeding Hollow witches placed on their people's blood.I need more for study.  Go gather Bleeding Hollow blood from the orcs in Zeth'Gor.  When you've gathered the blood, bring it to their cursed cauldron and boil it.  Bring me the boiled blood.10540At last, we are ready. I will bestow a piece of my spirit upon you, hero. It will guard you and help you in your battle against evil.You must then travel south of here towards the back of Illidari Point. Hidden in the ether is a vile creature known as Veneratus the Many. My spirit hunter will call him out when he is near.Destroy Veneratus and take from his corpse the second part of the Cipher of Damnation.10541I thank you, hero. For without you, my spirit would forever remain in this cursed place.Take it and deliver it to my father at the farm, far to the northeast, above Coilskar Cistern...

But once me do that, the Bloodmaul bury T'chali and leave him here to rot!The worst part of it was that they stole me hookah!So, you want to help T'chali?  You bring me hookah back.  T'chali think the ogres that stole it headed southwest over by the mine.And while you're in there, pick up some brews, too!10543T'chali has been waiting for his revenge!The day they bury T'chali and leave him to die, it was Grimnok Battleborn that led them.  And the next day it was Korgaah that come south to raid and kick T'chali in the head.I want them dead!You will find Grimnok atop the Southmaul Tower in Bloodmaul Outpost.

But what T'chali did not say was why.The Bloodmaul are in dire straits.  The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight.That's when T'chali came up with a great idea.  Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy?

I couldn't place it at first but the signs are all there...Now if we could get our hands on some bloodthistle, we'd be in business.In my travels, I met a shady Broken in Shattrath named Tobias.Tobias made a business of trading bloodthistle to blood elves for rotten arakkoa eggs.Directly west of here are arakkoa ruins. Search them for an egg and head to the lower city of Shattrath. That's where you'll find Tobias.10550I wasn't lying. That egg was incredible.

You will find High Priestess Ishanah inside the Shrine of Unending Light.10555The magic practiced by the Lashh'an arakkoa is unnatural. They rip out handfuls-clawfuls?-of their own feathers as reagents!That doesn't sound like good magic to me. I've come here to learn more about their spells. Unfortunately getting close is too much for me.You could succeed: cast one of their spells on yourself, then return to me. You'll have to find one of their spellbooks, high up in the trees of Veil Lashh.And unless you've grown feathers I can't see, you'll need to get some of those.10556The pictograms indicate using feathers to cast the spell at one of the circles of power in Veil Lashh.Confusing iconography seems to show an arakkoa being suffused with the spirit of a kaliri.10557I built an amazing device, the Zephyrium Capacitorium, and I'm sure it'll work perfectly, but... do you want to help me test it?There's plenty of hazard pay!Speak with my twin over there, Rally.

We're under constant assault from the Burning Legion.From their base of Legion Hold to the northwest, the demons rain down a ceaseless stream of infernals. As quickly as we can kill them, the new meteors impact and begin a new wave of attacks.My men are ragged and exhausted. I don't know how much longer they'll hold out. Please, , lend your help to our defenses. Take your place on the line and halt the advance of the infernals!10563The fortress of Legion Hold is nigh impregnable, and to be completely honest, I can't spare the forces for an assault. Our hopes are riding on you, .What little information we've been able to gather indicates that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and learn about their plans. Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders. Good luck, .10564The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.10565The arakkoa of Vekh'nir have been a thorn in our sides for many years. Some strange religion guides them, a religion which has the arakkoa in a frenzy of activity. They carry these crystals with them now, which they have turned to some dark purpose.I know something of their rituals. They take the crystals to their spell circles to infuse them. We at the village would like to know more. Waylay a few of the arakkoa until you find a crystal, charge it, then return it to me.10566I've fashioned four wands that I believe will enhance the power of the arakkoa's crystals. Take these wands to Trogma's Claim, and try them on the ogre slaves.You'll need to find an infused crystal off of the arakkoa in the area.When you figure out which is best, come back to me.10567The arakkoa of Ruaan Weald elevate from their flock the Harbingers of the Raven, the heralds of their god.They believe that the Harbingers watch over them from the sky, where they receive the teachings of the Raven, and descend to pass this message along.The Harbingers hold a powerful sway over the souls of the arakkoa. They use magical pendants, which we need.Attract one of the Harbingers by slaying its flock and taking their claws. Place the claws upon the altar to get his attention.10568Years ago, the dreaded warlock known as Gul'dan raised the volcano in the middle of Shadowmoon.  The draenei village of Baa'ri, to the southwest, was buried under the lava along with its inhabitants and artifacts of religious importance.The treacherous tribe of Broken known as the Ashtongue has been ordered by Illidan to excavate the area.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor, now known as the Black Temple.10569Our scouts have brought back disturbing reports from the ruined arakkoa encampments in the area.The ghosts of powerful arakkoa magicians wield powers we never thought they possessed. They seem to be organizing, as though preparing for something, but our knowledge is limited. We cannot afford to remain ignorant!Travel north to the Sketh'lon Wreckage, to the northwest of the Deathforge and search for signs of their motives.10570Pungent...Now, take this bundle and place it at the other end of this bridge. When the envoy makes his daily rounds, he will be compelled to pick it up - without his bodyguard. You see, blood elves look down upon bloodthistle addicts. If any of his compatriots ever found out...All you need to do is lie in wait for him to dismiss his bodyguard. When he is alone, make your strike! Kill him and take the missive.10571According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri.  Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor.We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet.  Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan.Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily.  Obtain them and bring them to me.10572We cannot permit the Legion to carry out its plan to destroy Wildhammer Stronghold on their march to the Black Temple.There's only one way to stop them, . You must create an explosive large enough to destroy the Legion's entire stockpile of infernals at the hold.The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the base of your device. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for armor plating we might be able to make a casing from.10573From your findings at Legion Hold, we know that the Legion's Shadow Council allies are producing infernals in the Deathforge. I've dispatched a small scouting party to keep watch over the area, but they're not able to accomplish everything we need.If the Deathforge is left alone to operate, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold.I want you to meet up with Stormer Ewan Wildwing, at the Deathforge Tower, to the northwest, overlooking the Deathforge itself.10574According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors.  These dreaded Broken were once powerful shaman who now defile the very elements they revered.Haalum, Corruptor of Air, can be found at Netherwing Pass.  Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan.  Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point.Find them and obtain the medallion fragments.10575The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion.  The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half.I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning.He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage.I want you to find that dreaded prison,  and find the whereabouts of Akama.  His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to.10576This is going to be tricky, but I think I can make it work.I can disguise you as one of these Illidari blood elves, . What I need first, though, are several pieces of their armor. It is imperative that the armor be clean. No blood stains! We want to avoid suspicion.Bring me the gear and I'll take care of the rest of the disguise.Once the disguise is assembled, you're going to deliver the message to the Grand Commander - in person.10577Take this disguise and enter Eclipse Point. Once inside, use the disguise to cloak yourself. The Eclipsion blood elves will be unable to see through the disguise, thereby granting you safe passage to Grand Commander Ruusk.Once you find Ruusk, tell him where next to move the cipher. You're going to have to act your heart out, . Play it off as if you are his superior, delivering a message from his lord. That should do it!Oh - watch out for the dragonhawks as they see through the disguise.10578That Cipher fragment will never reach Zuluhed. You're going to ambush Ruul the Darkener and his transport before it has a chance to make the delivery.The Dragonmaw Fortress is directly east of here, across the Netherwing Fields. Somewhere between Dragonmaw Fortress and the Sanctum of the Stars is where you'll find Ruul. Strike hard and strike fast! And , from the sound of it, this Ruul is going to be tough. Keep your guard up.Return the Cipher to me should you succeed.10579Take this box to my father. He still resides at Oronok's Farm, far to the north, above Coilskar Cistern. When all three fragments are pieced together, the ancient words will be known once more.Good luck, . Tell my father that I will be home soon.10580Despite the good that we've done here, I feel bad about one thing: driving Toshley and his gnome friends away.We had no choice; they were making a mess of our efforts in the grove with all of their technology and experimentation.I would appreciate it if you would find out what became of them.  Last we heard, they headed east across the bridge.  I'm certain that they must have turned south, away from Thunderlord Stronghold.Look for a clue as to their whereabouts in the southern Jagged Ridge.10581VERY WELL, I AM HEREBY WARNING YOU THAT YOU WILL FIND NOTHING UP ON THE RIDGE.DO NOT FOLLOW THE TRAIL OF SPARE PARTS THAT LEAD TO TOSHLEY'S STATION!  YOU WILL NOT FIND TOSHLEY, NOR ANY OTHER GNOME THERE.10582That puts our observations into perspective. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.The Shadow Council has the Deathforge sealed tighter than a new keg o' thunderbrew. The first thing you'll need to do is crack some skulls so you can get in there and poke around. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!10583Wing Commander Nuainn originally sent three of us out here to keep watch over the Deathforge and to gather information. Flanis Swiftwing volunteered to try to infiltrate the Deathforge, but we haven't heard anything from him in days.I fear the worst, . Flanis is a skilled scout, but if he's gotten in over his head, we have no way of knowing. Search the Deathforge for him and recover any information or items he might have collected.10584Those dumb ogres at the Bladespire Outpost to the north have been raiding our power converters!  And you're going to get them back for me, sort of.No doubt, with their big, clumsy hands, the ogres have damaged the converters.  So, what I want you to do is release the energy from them and then use this protovoltaic magneto collector on the resultant electromental to encase it.It'll likely be sore with you, so you'll need to 'kill' it while it's contained in the magneto sphere.10585In order for the Shadow Council to construct infernals as quickly as they're being used, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the corrupted elementals that serve as the souls of the creatures.The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.10586We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council's operations at the Deathforge, but if we're to truly be triumphant, we'll need to defeat the Legion's overseer there.I found a key among the items in Flanis's pack. I'm certain it will prove useful in tracking down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold.After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Wing Commander Nuainn. He'll want to know immediately!10587Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor.  Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss.Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself.  I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons.  We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not.10588How many times has this spell been used in the history of our worlds? Undoubtedly, its power for destruction is unparalleled.What you must do now is take the cipher, now made whole, and read from it at the Altar of Damnation - where the memory of Gul'dan stands.What you will see once the words are uttered are the memories left imprinted upon the land. Stand your ground and await the coming of Cyrukh.You must be victorious, . This land cannot withstand another shattering.10589According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's nestled in the northern mountains. The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter located at Legion Hold.Certain members of the Legion host carry devices allowing them to activate the teleporters. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed.10594Take these scanners to the Singing Ridge.  By dropping them in a pattern on the ground, you will create overlapping fields that will read the amplitude of the crystals.  Stand amidst them in such a way that you're in five oscillation fields and I'll have the information that I need!Your scanners will even work with those that others drop.Oh, and it's likely that a rift will be formed!  I have no idea what, if anything, will come out of it, but be prepared for the worst.10595Our scouts are putting up a good fight, but the infernals keep coming!From their base of Legion Hold to the southwest, the demons bombard us with impunity! Even the elite Kor'kron guard cannot hold them off forever.I'm drafting every able-bodied  to do their part in defense of Shadowmoon Village. This is no game, . The survival of the village is at stake. Do your duty to the Horde, and join the fray!10596The fortress of Legion Hold is your target. You'll have no reinforcements, so a frontal attack is out of the question.What little information we have shows that the Legion stocks and prepares its infernals at the hold. With the help of a disguise I'll give you, you must sneak into Legion Hold and discover their plans.Your best hope is to intercept or overhear communication between their commanders.10597We can't allow the Legion to trample us on their march to Black Temple.Find a way to destroy the infernals they intend to use against us. That's not a request, ; it's an order.The Fetid Pool near Legion Hold holds an old fel reaver power core you could use as the basis for a kind of fel bomb. Search the other wreckage near the fel reaver for a section of armor plating. You should be able to make a bomb powerful enough to take out those infernals and give the hold a nice shake!10598The device we've assembled won't win any beauty contests, but it should be capable of destroying the infernals amassed at Legion Hold. Judging from what the fel reaver power core's energy did to the Fetid Pool, it holds a respectable amount of explosive power.If you set the device off in the middle of the green glyph at the hold, it should be in range to hit all of the infernals.10599While you were taking care of the infernals at Legion Hold, I've been going over your reports. We've got no reason to believe the Legion lied about what's going on at the Deathforge. They're really cranking out infernals down there, so I've dispatched a scouting party to keep watch over it.If we don't shut down the Deathforge, they'll rebuild the infernal stockpile that you destroyed at Legion Hold.Report to Scout Zagran atop Slag Watch, to the southeast of here and overlooking the Deathforge.10600That fills in the gaps we've seen. We've caught glimpses of them launching infernals in the direction of the hold, but haven't been able to find much more than that.The Shadow Council has the forge pretty much locked down. Looks like you're going to need to fight your way in. Start eliminating the Shadow Council guarding the entrance to the Deathforge!10601The scouting party originally had three members. Unfortunately, Kagrosh decided he wanted to be a hero.He descended into the Deathforge and we haven't heard from him since.In all likelihood, the fool's gone and gotten himself killed. The Shadow Council members aren't idiots and Kagrosh wasn't exactly strong in the subtlety department, if you know what I mean. Keep an eye out for him in the Deathforge and recover any information or items he might have collected.10602In order to churn out infernals as quickly as the Deathforge seems to, they must have an area dedicated to summoning the elementals that form the core of the infernals.The summoning chamber is likely to be found below ground, near a pool of fouled water or lava. Locate the summoning chamber within the Deathforge and find a way to end their summoning ritual. The mo'arg involved in making the infernals may carry a tool that will help disrupt the summoner's magics.10603We've made a lot of progress against the Shadow Council here at the Deathforge, but now it's time to finish the job.I found a key among the items in Kagrosh's pack. At least he accomplished something before they got to him.The key should help you to track down this Warbringer Razuun you observed at Legion Hold.After you've hunted down and dealt with Warbringer Razuun, report directly to Blood Guard Gulmok. We must not keep him waiting.10604According to Razuun's orders, the massive infernal staging area is called Invasion Point: Cataclysm and it's located in the mountains behind our village! The only way to reach it is by using a teleporter at Legion Hold.Certain Legion minions carry a device allowing them to use the teleporter. You must capture one of these devices to win access to the teleporter. Slaughter all of the demons if you must, but you can't afford to return empty-handed. Do not delay; the enemy is perilously close.10606The best way to destroy the rest of the Legion's supplies is to use their own weapons against them. I've been working on a rig that will let you take control of one of those Fel Reaver Sentinels below.There are a couple things I need to work out, yet. For that, I'll need the manual that Doctor Gutrick keeps locked in a chest at the bottom of the ramp. He probably won't give up the key without a fight, so you'll need to capture it. Bring the fel reaver manual back to me and I'll do the rest!10607At Grishnath, totems left by the Oracles of the Raven enable the arakkoa to hear the Word of the Raven. Unfortunately, the language of the arakkoa is indecipherable to us.Using the Harbinger's pendant, we can understand it. You will be able to take the souls of the arakkoa to understand their language.

They now roam in front of the Black Temple with vengeance in their hearts.It is the clerics of Karabor that hold the cloak of Gorefiend.10636One by one they knelt before him, offering their lives as a show of allegiance. Gorefiend hoisted his sickle and cut clean their heads. Shortly after this slaughter, Gorefiend took his own life.But this was no act of contrition! No, Gorefiend sought immortality!

Never have I seen beasts able to withstand the searing heat of molten lava!Outside of Shadowmoon Village, where the ground has ruptured and lava flows through the cracks, you will find felfire diemetradons. Slay them and bring me their spleens. From their spleens I will be able to begin preliminary analysis of their resistance to heat.Begin your search to the southeast.10661Have you ever heard of food that cooks itself and stays hot forever? Dare to dream, I say!But maybe it's not a dream at all! Outside the fortress, near the lava pools and streams, you can find beasts that thrive in the sizzling heat. They're called felfire diemetradons.The dwarves around here tell me that those diemetradons have the tastiest spleens ever and that the spleens practically come pre-cooked! Bring me those spleens and I'll give you some coin.Start your search directly east of here.10662This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated for your use.There was a talented smith who accompanied the Sons of Lothar to Draenor, David Wayne. He was a remarkable blacksmith, but chose to leave the expedition. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you with the weapon.10663This is beyond my ability, but that's not to say the weapon can't be recreated.It pains me to suggest this, but your only hope may be a human smith by the name of David Wayne. It's true he was once a member of the Alliance's expedition, but that was a long time ago and he has since left the Sons of Lothar. These days, he lives in a small camp on a peninsula east of Firewing Point in Terokkar Forest. Take the ingots to him and see if he can help you.10664The ingots that you brought contain most of the metal I'll need to forge the sword's blade, but I'll need a variety of things to create other parts of the weapon.Let's see, among the things I don't have here are an adamantite frame, some heavy knothide leather, and a demon warding totem. Skilled crafters should be able to produce the first two, but the third is only sold by the reagent vendor in Shattrath's Lower City, Fantei. You'll find him with the other tradesmen.10665Working with the ingots you brought is going to require a lot of heat -- rather more than a conventional forge can supply.I'm going to need a supplemental heat source for the forge and there are very few things in Outland that can supply that kind of power.The Mechanar area of Tempest Keep turns out manacells containing an incredible amount of power. Find one of the overcharged manacells from the stacks around Mechano-Lord Capacitus and bring it back here.10666Recreating the enchantments on the blade requires several spells to be spoken in demonic.It's not something I was taught during my training as an apprentice, but there's no way around it. There's a book, called the Lexicon Demonica, that will provide most of the words I need, but it's in the hands of a powerful Shadow Council warlock.Deep in the halls of Auchindoun's Shadow Labyrinth, it is held by Grandmaster Vorpil. Do whatever you must to secure the book and bring it to me.10667The frame that you brought me earlier will not be sufficient to hold molten metal without reinforcement. A rare kind of earth can be used to cool and imbue the frame, giving the adamantite an unnatural strength.Underwold loam, as the earth is known, is accorded great value among the naga. Few enough of them possess it, and in Outland, I know of only one naga who uses it -- Hydromancer Thespia, who resides in the Steamvault of Coilfang Reservoir.10668I still have respect for Illidan.  Without him I would not have found my path.He is not who he once was, however.  His soul has been corrupted by power, his mind has been twisted by defeat.  He has become what I am sworn to destroy and his pet servants, the Illidari, are as much of an abomination as any demon of the Burning Legion.His grasp on Outland is slipping yet his reach is still vast.  Prove you're not with him by slaying his lieutenant Lothros at Illidari Point in Shadowmoon Valley.10669Some demons pledge allegiance to no one but themselves.  A true enemy of demons finds and destroys his prey regardless of affiliation, however.The demon Xeleth - a Legion defector - was once worshipped as a god by primitive swamp creatures in Zangarmarsh.  When Draenor was nearly destroyed, he retreated into a slumber deep beneath Marshlight Lake.  Find the portal at the lake and plant this spear into the ground.Xeleth will awake - be ready to slay him and prove you're an enemy to all demons.10670The sword's enchantments must be contained within a powerful focus, such as a gem. I know of a gem that we can use for this purpose, for there are few that can play host to such powerful magics without shattering.The gem we need is called the tear of the earthmother. It's a powerful artifact in the hands of the ogres who created it, and Warbringer O'mrogg, who currently holds the gem, has many powerful allies in Hellfire Citadel's Shattered Halls. Take care in retrieving the tear, .10671, I've got something else for you to do.  One of the eggheads wants to study the fiendling flesh beasts that can be found at Razaan's Landing, north of the Razor Ridge.More to the point, they want to study the flesh of the flesh beasts that are there.But, of course, they aren't willing to get their hands dirty, and they only want the ether-energized flesh, which it's not likely that all of them have.I say, beggars can't be choosers, but what can you do?10672We must study these creatures further.Far to the east - near the huge lava flow beneath the ruins of Baa'ri - you will find arcano control units. These controllers were crafted by a genius named Gnomus for the sole purpose of exploring lava via mechanical scorpion.He has long since lost his mind and is now only interested in eating the hottest food known to gnome-kind.I want you to use the control and tag the diemetradons of the lava flow for further study.10673Gnomus knows about the massive diemetradon and plans to eat it! He must have been able to see what I could see through the eyes of his arcano-scorp. Look, there's no time to explain. He's crazy and that craziness is going to cost us the closest thing we've got to a fireproof jumpsuit.Get back to the lava flow near Baa'ri and track down Felspine the Greater. Once you find it, kill it and bring me back its hide.Don't try and reason with me, . I'm well past that point.10674The Razaani ethereals have been playing with some interesting technology at Razaan's Landing to the north.I'm sure they won't mind if you use this trap to take a few samples of their little pink floating light orbs?  They're probably only for decoration anyway.The trap has a special property to it that when opened should attract one of the floating balls towards it.  Of course, it'll probably also alert the Razaani to your presence.10675These orbs are made up of both nether energy and souls, some of them gnome souls!How dare they!  Were they the ones killing our people that traveled north?!, you must put a stop to this, and the only way to do that is to finish off their leader, Nexus-Prince Razaan.You'll have to coax him out of hiding though.  I'm guessing that you can do that by killing a lot of his Razaani ethereal.Bring me the collection of souls that he no doubt has.10676You've done well in getting everything we'll need to reforge the anti-demon blade. Your hard work and dedication is about to be repaid.The time has come to forge the sword.10677I remember seeing larger diemetradons east of the Hand of Gul'dan, near the lava flows around the Ruins of Baa'ri. What I want you to get for me now is one overdeveloped felfire gizzard from the beasts around that area. You might have to kill several to find a gizzard like the one I described. Keep at it! One of them is bound to have my next meal.10678Long story short, I used to work with a blood elf named Tiorus. My partnership with Tiorus dissolved once I got into gourmet living. He decided to take it upon himself to continue our research using MY inventions. Anyhow, he had some of his Horde goons using my arcano-scorp probes at the Ruins of Baa'ri lava flow and discovered the mother of all diemetradons!I need you to get there before he does and kill the diemetradon, Felspine, and bring his hide back to me.Hurry up!10679The blade is nearly finished!You can almost feel the magic beginning to coalesce inside the steel, but one thing remains to be done.You must take the forged blade to the Scalding Pools near the top of the Hand of Gul'dan in Shadowmoon Valley and plunge it into the lava pools to quench the sword.

They're in search of draenei artifacts, no doubt - Baa'ri was home to many Baa'ri relics before Gul'dan buried the town under a volcanic explosion.  We must use this opportunity to recover the Tablets of Baa'ri, an ancient text rumored to hold the secrets of the Temple of Karabor... a place you might know as the Black Temple.10684According to the tablets, an artifact known as a Medallion of Karabor was kept at Baa'ri.  Only the highest-ranking draenei priests were granted these, as they allowed unfettered access into the Temple of Karabor.We must find out whether the Ashtongue have recovered the medallion that was kept at Baa'ri yet.  Its power would provide great aid in our fight against Illidan.Akama's lieutenant at Baa'ri, Oronu the Elder, receives written orders from him daily.  Obtain them and bring them to me.10685According to Akama's letter, four fragments of the medallion were unearthed and given to the Ashtongue Corruptors.

Eykenen and Uylaru, Corruptors of Earth and Fire, were last seen at the Fel Pits near the Hand of Gul'dan.  Lakaan, Corruptor of Water, is rumored to be near Coilskar Point.Find them and obtain the medallion fragments.10686The fragments you obtained are only half of the medallion.  The Ashtongue leader, Akama, must have kept the other half.I dread to ask this of you, as Akama is both evil and cunning.He and the Ashtongue Deathsworn - the vilest and most brutal of the tribe - are rumored to run a torture chamber inside the Warden's Cage.I want you to find that dreaded prison,  and find the whereabouts of Akama.  His second in command at the location is a Broken known as Sanoru - interrogate him if you have to.10687Our scouts have reported a massive influx of Sunfury blood elf recruits heading to the Ruins of Karabor.  Normally this would represent a purely military threat, however we believe something else is amiss.Descriptions of their attire and fighting style are suspiciously close to that of Illidan himself.  I do not want to become alarmed without good reason, so I would like you to go there and bring me back their weapons.  We will then determine whether my fears are unfounded or not.10688The weapons are authentic, as we feared.

He may go undetected where we cannot.10715So, your Rexxar would have me fashion a poison for him? I'll give him what he desires, but there will be a price. Even for friends, there must be a price. Free things destroy friendships.First, you must venture a short distance to the southwest to the Churning Gulch.Therein mill some of the most poisonous creatures in all of Outland, or anywhere. I speak of the crust bursters, and this poison will require gathering their glands for me.10717Pardon me, but I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with Chawn.  I'd like to help.I'm studying the Blackwing Coven, and helping the druids in their dealings with them.I am very interested in acquiring a few of their dragon whelps; it would help us to gauge exactly what we're up against by understanding that which they revere.But first, we're going to need to acquire some nets.  I noticed that the wyrmcult poachers out in the Ruuan Weald have an abundance of them.10718, now that you can see me, there is something you must tell Rexxar. I know that he seeks his people, and I know where they are.The Mok'Nathal, as they are known, have a village to the east beyond the Razor Ridge.Go, give Rexxar this news. His people are in danger, and I know that he will want to come to their aid.10719The cultist dropped this note, which apparently was to be delivered to Overseer Nuaar.  It is signed by someone named Kolphis Darkscale.It is likely that Tree Warden Chawn will be interested in looking at this.10720The ogres, simple as they are, would notice you dispersing this poison throughout their camp. Thus, I will teach you how to enlist the help of one of nature's smallest creatures to do this task.By playing a simple rhythm on this drum, you can coax a marmot to follow your commands.There is a den of marmots near the Bloodmaul camp, to the north, down in the Daggermaw Canyon past the Circle of Blood.Once you have a marmot's aid, use it to disperse the poison to the Bloodmaul's kegs.10721, I have a pet boar named Huffer. He wants to help you to have some fun with one of the nearby sons of Gruul.Grulloc inhabits a place known as the Cursed Hollow. When you get there, let Huffer loose.

Go northwest through the tunnel.First, kill the ogres for their heads. We will send a message. Set the trap at his altar. When he is dead, plant the grisly totems near him - none can mistake that message.Take the bear.10724Shortly after my arrival in the mountains, I came under attack by a group of Bladespire ogres.Though I fought free of them, and slew many, they took my wyvern, Leokk, captive. Spirit has found him, locked in a cage in the heart of the Bladespire encampment outside of Gruul's lair.One of the ogres must carry his key.

If he left his comrades at the camp, there's a chance you might be able to persuade him to help us understand what the dark conclave arakkoa are planning.Start your search for him along the road in Magma Fields to the northwest. It seems a likely place for him to take refuge.10760The Sketh'lon Wreckage, just to the east, is an eerie place. The peons are convinced that it's cursed.There are few trees here, so the peons have no choice but to venture into the arakkoa ruins to chop wood.

Search the Sketh'lon Wreckage for evidence of their plans.10761There's nothing here that would explain why the spirits of these arakkoa have remained in this world or how they came into thirst for the blood of orcs.I think our best lead is to try to find the deserter mentioned in the journal.

I'll try my hand at it, but I make no promises.10764It's not working, .  I cannot give it enough heat... the materials will not be properly tempered.You know, the fel reavers used by the Burning Legion are powered by a scalding core of fel fire - it burns much hotter than normal fire.If you could find enough people to take one down, you could heat the mold in the insides of the fallen reaver.  Beware, , those fel reavers pack quite a punch.10765At the southern end of the Path of Conquest, near a stationary caravan, I discovered what looked like a meeting between a giant and a blood elf chancellor.

While the orcish Horde massed under Gul'dan, my people sought to defend ourselves from the threat by striking against him. Gul'dan learned of their intentions and cast a mighty spell that destroyed our camps and twisted the spirits of my brothers.They must be stopped before they unleash a greater evil. In the Sketh'lon Wreckage to the north, seek out Asghar and bring me the totem he carries. With it, we can begin to thwart the dark conclave's plans.10778The totem alone is not strong enough to counteract the sinister magics of the dark conclave.We can combine it with other objects of power, forming a staff to focus the energies. We cannot rescue my brethren from the depths of their depravity, but we can stop them.One of the items I need for the staff is the Rod of Lianthe, held by the blood elves at Eclipse Point to the southeast. It is kept in a pavilion on the top tier of the ruins and will be heavily guarded. Use caution, .10780There is one last element missing from the staff. We must direct the staff's power toward the Dark Conclave spirits.We can do that by gathering feathers scattered on the ground at the Sketh'lon Base Camp and using them in the staff. The base camp is to the south, east of Wildhammer Stronghold.Gul'dan's magic utterly destroyed my brethren, leaving only their spirits, but it did not stop there. The magic fed on the spell the arakkoa were preparing, forging a sinister force that engulfed the spirits.10781They are probably searching for you on the Path of Conquest as we speak.

To the east, near the Fel Pits and south of the Deathforge, is the Altar of Damnation.There, fragments of Gul'dan's past are trapped. When you carry the unfinished headpiece of the staff into the area around the altar, don't be surprised if some of the entities react to it. You will be carrying a dangerous object with strong connections to the cataclysm.10783Here is my plan. We will poison the ogres and then destroy their gronn master.During my travels in these mountains, I met a man named Baron Sablemane. He is a master of the alchemical arts, and may be convinced to assist us.You will find him at the Circle of Blood, down in the canyon to the north of here. Whatever price he requires, I will leave it to your discretion to accept.10784, you've done us more than proud in the fight against the ogres so far.

As I add the finishing touches, I'd like you to set this incense by the candles near the runestone to my left.I believe it will help us to attract the wolf spirit's attention, since it was made in the days of the orcish clans.

Gorgrom the Dragon-Eater is behind the recent Bloodmaul plans against Sylvanaar!Why he's manipulating them, and not just using the Bladespire, I don't know.  But if we're to deal with a gronn, we're going to need help.I know a man who is wise in the ways of all sorts of exotic magics.  Baron Sablemane is his name, and you can find him at the Circle of Blood, back down the ramp to the northwest, and then southwest through the canyon.Ask him to fashion us a trap for the gronn.10799Very well, I'll create this trap, but first I want something in return.There happens to be a nearby gronn that is in possession of an item that I want, but you can't face him, not yet anyway.So, you and I are going to fashion a sleeping powder from the poison of the nearby crust bursters.You'll find them in the Churning Gulch to the southwest.  Bring me a number of their glands, and be quick about it!10800I've outdone myself again.  I've fashioned a sleeping powder for you to use on Grulloc, the gronn I spoke of who is guarding what I want.Grulloc keeps himself at the Cursed Hollow, an area at the eastern edge of Dragons' End on the other side of the Circle of Blood.If I were you, I wouldn't tarry long once you have his sack.  The effects of the dust won't last long.10801There's nothing more that I hate in this world than the sons of Gruul and their father!

Your strength in battle is without question... is your spirit just as strong?Please, return to Honor Hold and speak with Klatu, in an upper room at the Honor Hold inn.10904We must shut down the Burning Legion's access to Death's Door, but first you're going to destroy their two warp-gates!The problem is, we can't even scratch one of those things, so you're going to need to use their own weapons against them.The death's might, death's watch, deathforge over-smiths and deathforge technicians carry the ammunition for the fel cannons.Normally it wouldn't affect any of them, but if you bring the cannonballs to me, I will imbue them with Nature's unbridled wrath!10908You look surprised to be talking to me. I do not blame you. My people, the arakkoa, deserve to be feared.Speak with Rilak the Redeemed in Shattrath City if you wish to know more. He can be found in the northern part of the Lower City, with the other outcasts of Skettis.And, , we will speak again.10909Colonel Jules was cursed in a battle near the Gor'gaz Outpost, a haunt for Shattered Hand fel orcs.  My master, Barada, works feverishly to cure the poor human, but he needs help.  The Colonel's tormented spirit seeks peace, and his path to peace is, I fear, a path of vengeance.Take this anchorite relic to Gor'gaz Outpost.  Place it upon the ground near Shattered Hand orcs and defeat them.  This will release their fel spirits -- you must slay those fel spirits for Jules' own spirit's recovery.10910Now there is an even greater threat from the Burning Legion.  To the south is a portal known as Death's Door, which opens upon the horrific world where the Legion breeds its deadly hounds.To get there, exit Evergrove by heading east up the ramp.  Follow the path south, through the Bladed Gulch, Razaan's Landing, Razor Ridge and the Scalewing Shelf.  Then, take the ramp down into the Vekhaar Stand and enter Death's Door through the tunnel, south of Mok'Nathal.Once there, use this druid signal.10911Now that the ammunition can affect the Burning Legion, it's time for you to use it.There are two warp-gates, which are used for teleportation and enhancement of the void terrors.  One is in the south and the other in the north, and each is within range of a fel cannon.Use the naturalized ammunition to take control of each fel cannon and destroy the warp-gates.Attack the gate with artillery to begin, and be prepared to kill its defenders to keep the cannon alive if necessary.10912Baelmon the Hound-Master must die!  He maintains the ritual that keeps the portal functioning.The Death's Door portal is located at the north end of the canyon.  When you find it, you will find Baelmon.You're going to need help on this one, so take this wand.

We pursued the creatures into the night.  Some of our people we found dead in the dark, others we could hear struggling against their captors. By morning we had come to this place and we fought a fierce battle but we were beaten.  Dreadfang poison will soon take my companions and I cannot last long.  Before I die I must know that the dreadfang widows were beaten.10921You have slain many of the dreadfang widows but they will continue to spawn and soon they will strike at us again.

To the northeast, beyond Auchindoun, is the Writhing Mound, a place where necromancers gather.  The auchenai death-speakers and doomsayers carry doom skulls that are laced with powerful necro-enchantments.  If you collect enough skulls you can use their power along with the power of the Dread Relic to command Teribus to face you.10924The blood of the warp chasers in this area is a powerful and rare reagent. It's one of my biggest sellers.Normally, I take my imp, Zeppit, out to help me gather it. Warp chaser blood is simply too caustic to be handled safely by you or I, but it doesn't bother Zeppit.Things are getting busier here at the shop, so if I send Zeppit with you, will you help gather the blood? Zeppit's attention tends to wander, so you'll need to be close to the chaser when it dies for Zeppit to do his work.10926We will not make it back on our own.  The dreadfang poison is too strong.

What was once a bastion of sanctuary for the Netherwing is now home to the Dragonmaw. While the orcs may have control of our territory, our magic there is still strong. Strong enough to cloak your true identity and allow you to infiltrate the ranks of Dragonmaw.I have prepared this letter for you to present to their leader, Overlord Mor'ghor. Fly headlong into the maw of our enemy and seek out Dragonmaw Base Camp to start your new life as a fel orc of Illidan Stormrage.11014Alright grunt, first things first. If you're gonna join my beloved Dragonmaw army, you'll need to work. Everyone works up here on the ledge. Get a job and don't screw it up and I'll see if there might be something more interesting for you to do later.Go talk to Taskmaster Varkule Dragonbreath. He's standin' in the middle of town. He'll assess your skills and assign work as he sees fit.Now get out of my face!11015No good at nothin'? That's fine. Even lunkheads like you can be used around here.

Gather those and bring 'em back to me and I'll consider your work order for the day complete.11016A skinner, eh? Well you'll find plenty to skin here! You gotta search for flayers around crystal formations. Take 'em down and take their hides. Sometimes they'll have a hide worth keepin'. Bring those to me.11017A flower picker?! Hilarious... Unfortunately, our mages and shaman need your services. The netherdust bushes that grow on this ledge have special pollen that is apparently very useful in their magical dealings. Bring me that stuff and I'll consider your work order complete.11018A miner!An orc after my own heart! That's how Varkule got his start - minin'! There ain't nothin' better than getting down and dirty in the mines, is there?Now get out there and find those nethercite deposits. Strip 'em for all their worth and bring me back the ore.1101911020The Dragonmaw have peons stationed at nearly every crystal formation up here.

Take from them their corrupt fel glands. Use those fel glands with this mutton that I'll give you near the peons. They'll take one bite and fall deathly ill!11021This mysterious tome was on Talonpriest Ishaal's body.

And that means we're having a hell of a time getting our people through there, not to mention the risk those demons pose to Ogri'la.What do you say?

In addition to the creatures here having them, they can sometimes be found where the flayers dig at the larger crystals.11026You've arrived at the perfect time, friend!  We are in need of assistance.  In return, you will receive something very rare, which will help us both in the end.We're not a violent ogre any longer, but the demons nearby threaten to overrun us and the Skyguard.  The problem with demons is that, once killed, they come right back in new bodies!But, if you use this crystal to summon a banishing portal, when they die near it, their essences will be drawn in and banished back from whence they came!11028This almanac presages the return of Terokk, the most powerful and terrible Skettis king in arakkoa history.I always believed this to be the mere legend, .  The return of the talonpriests and your recovery of this tome indicate otherwise.With each day, Terokk comes closer to returning to full strength.  Your only chance is to bring him to our world prematurely.  Return to Skettis and speak to Adaris about this.  Let us hope he has the wisdom to do the right thing.11029Open the package, .  It is a disguise.  It doesn't look very convincing, does it?I craft them for ethereal smugglers in search of rare books.  There is an arakkoa scribe who dwells in the central island in Skettis, Terokk's Rest; his name is Sahaak.

Remnants of their civilization are still present.  We call them apexis relics.What we know about them is that, when properly used, they grant a boon.  Each relic presents a colored sequence which, when the crystals are pressed in the correct order, leads through a series of levels, each harder than the last.An apexis shard is needed to power the relic.  Return when you have attained the insight of the apexis vibration.11059You've figured out how to use the single-person relics, but as you may have seen, there are bigger ones, which they surround.These larger apexis monuments function in much the same way, but they take 35 apexis shards to activate.Of greater concern to us are the guardians that are summoned through their use.  These crystal constructs turned on their arakkoan masters long ago, and now endanger Ogri'la.We would ask that you destroy one and bring us proof.11061As to that other magical flask, it can only be obtained from one spot: Bash'ir Landing.

Take this flare that their overlord gave you and deliver it to Commander Arcus. He is standing guard right outside this building.11101Take these Aldor medals. Mor'ghor will need proof of \"victory\" once this is over.

Just give me the word.11102You can fly around as a crow... so what!  Ever annihilate something on the ground while you were flying?  Want to?Forge Camp: Wrath and Forge Camp: Terror, to the north and south, are a major pain in my backside, as well as being a threat to peaceful Ogri'la.  With all of those fel cannons shooting down the Skyguard left and right, we can't get through there to take care of business.Want to prove yourself?

A plague that would devour all flesh: living, dead or undead.We've succeeded in creating this plague and we're here to hand deliver it to the Scourge's doorstep.The Alliance intercepted the ship carrying the latest strain engineered in our Undercity laboratories.  Head to the wreckage southeast of here and salvage whatever containers you can.11168I've a feeling the long trip across the sea is affecting the effectiveness of our plague.  What is needed is a potent toxin to boost the potency of the strain.The crabs near this beach are a distant relative of the much smaller brown-shelled tidecrawler.  The smaller tropical variety produces a paralytic toxin strong enough to knock out an ogre.As we all know bigger is better!  The much larger glands on the local variety should prove more potent.  Bring me a few!11170We've just received word of reinforcements coming to the aid of the Alliance forces.  Their timing couldn't be better!We're in sore need of test subjects and these North Fleet reservists will do nicely!Take these plague vials with you and speak to Camille, the Bat Handler.  Tell her you need to commandeer a riding bat for a special assignment for us.Once you're at sea, drop the vials on the reinforcement fleet.  I can't wait to see the results!11175Tell me, is it true? Did the explorers that went into Whisper Gulch go mad?My daughter is the overseer of the Explorers' League that went north to some place called Steel Gate. With the horrible events that have befallen us, I fear for her safety.Please, , I am too old to make the journey. Her name is Irena. Will you go make certain that she is alright?11176Our work out here is really just beginning. But now that we've brought these flying machines in from Westguard Keep, it should really pick up.The problem is that we're lacking enough qualified pilots. And with things getting worse in the Rivenwood to the north, I'd like to get things wrapped up here quickly and then head back home.If you can lend a hand, go have a chat with one of my chief archaeologists. You'll find them next to the flying machines on the north and south sides of the site.11182All things in nature seek a balance. It is only through the interference of those not in tune with that harmony that the balance is shifted.You waste your efforts when you kill the whelps and drakes. The real culprits behind the expansion of these magically burning woods are the newly awakened vrykul and their master, Skeld Drakeson.If it's blood on your hands that you seek, start with them. You will find their lair on the south side of the Ember Clutch.11187THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Those proto-drakes are attacking the keep!Beasts such as that should have been scared off when you took care of their clutches and whelps.You did take care of them, right?, this calls for more direct action. Speak with my advisor, Mage-Lieutenant Malister. He'll provide you with the means to get at those infernal creatures.11188Now that we've riled up these Ember Clutch proto-drakes, they may be inclined to continue their attacks upon the keep. This will not do.I hate to compound one wrong with another, but in this case it would appear that we will have to destroy the creatures. A regrettable course of action, but one that we need to undertake regardless.Take my wand. I've been experimenting with increasing its range, but it doesn't pack much of a punch. However, what it will do is get a proto-drake's attention.11190, who's the genius that made our cannons a non-standard size? Now we have ta make special cannonballs ta shoot out o' the infernal contraptions!I would look kindly on ye if ye would go out and find the balls we've already shot. No doubt with the way these louts shoot they be all o'er the place ta the south and east.That would be faster than us making 'em from scratch fer a certainty.11196Da Amani been rebuildin' their forces and dey raised up a new warlord to lead dem, .

Defeat him and put an end to da ambitions of da Zandalari and da Amani!11199, now that those damnable proto-creatures have been dealt with, I've another task for you.One of my scouts has reported back some suspicious activity by the Forsaken to the south. It looks like they're up to no good at the vrykul village known as Halgrind.I want you to personally take over the investigation down there. Speak with Scout Knowles to find out what he's uncovered and proceed from there.His last reported position is at the Ember Spear Tower, just to the west of Halgrind.11202The Forsaken are up to no good and from what I can tell, those plague tanks of sludge are a big part of it.If I may suggest, , we should probably destroy them before they can get any more use out of the things. I took the liberty of preparing a bundle of torches from the Ember Clutch. These things have been burning for days!Here, I'm sure you can put them to better use than I in destroying those tanks.11208Drazzit will expect to hear something from me soon, but I don't think the site is secure enough for me to leave. If you have time, would you be willing to take some of the salvaged cargo down to him at Mudsprocket?If you haven't been there yet, it's a small settlement to the southwest of here, beyond the Stonemaul Ruins. You can take the road there from Tabetha's Farm, too. When you get to Mudsprocket, the guy you're looking for is Drazzit Dripvalve.11211When that goblin... what's her name... Boxie, Foxy... Moxie, that's it! Anyway, when she came through here on her way to the zeppelin wreck, she said the town of Mudsprocket was having some problems.That crashed zeppelin was bringing them fresh supplies. If you follow the road south from here, past the Stonemaul Ruins, you'll eventually come to Mudsprocket.Why don't you check in with Drazzit Dripvalve down there and see if there's anything you can do to help?11212Deep in the heart of the swamp lives an old woman named Tabetha. We've never really known much about her, save that she's a good deal older than she appears. She's helped us from time to time and helped keep the peace here between the Horde and our forces.She used to keep in regular contact, but we haven't received one lately.Could you check in with her when you have time? Just follow the road beyond North Point Tower, where it turns south and into the Quagmire. You can see her farm from the road.11213A human woman named Tabetha lives on a small farm near the middle of the marsh. Ordinarily, I wouldn't associate with a human, but her help has proven useful at times.Unfortunately, she's been out of touch for quite some time now and I'm looking for someone to travel down to her farm to see if everything's all right.If you follow the road south out of the village, then into the swamp's interior, you'll find her farm near the middle of the Quagmire.11215The Steamwheedle Cartel's new outpost in the southern part of the marsh isn't faring so well. The zeppelin carrying supplies to Mudsprocket crashed, leaving them without vital tools, food, and medical supplies.Follow the road down south and into the marsh's interior. You'll pass by Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins before the road brings you to Mudsprocket. Offer any help you can provide to the town's leadership.11216I was sent here by my mentor to look for assistance, but unfortunately I'm not allowed outside of Lower City and the individuals that frequent this establishment tend to be less than helpful.You do seem different, more like the adventurous type.  If you're interested in aiding our cause, speak to Archmage Alturus outside of Medivh's old dwelling, Karazhan.In the meantime, I'm going to see about gaining access to the rest of the city.  One of our old associates is rumored to be here.11218, the captain's tasked me with a mission. I'd like you to help.A bunch of my fellow Explorers' League people went nuts digging up stuff in the Whisper Gulch just to the north. They're attacking anyone trying to get in!The captain is only concerned with the ore for the keep. Lucky for us, I have just the thing to do the trick.Get in there, blow up the ore, and bring it back along with any gems you find. Running this place isn't cheap you know!I gotta warn you though, that ore is strange!11219The Horde's children need you, .  The Headless Horseman, once a human paladin and now an insane fiend, has set fire to our village!  You must put out those fires!Grab a bucket and throw it onto the blaze, or toss it to an ally who is closer to the flames.  Extinguish all the fires and thwart the Headless Horseman!11220Until the head of the Headless Horseman is destroyed, his rampage will not end.The Horseman rests within the Forlorn Cloister of the Scarlet Monastery, in Tirisfal Glades.  Go to his pumpkin shrine and speak these words:  Horseman, rise  Your time is nigh  You felt death once  Now, know demise!This will rouse the fiend.  Destroy the head of the Horseman and he will plague us no longer.11221Our mission in Northrend is to destroy Arthas.  The Alliance are but an obstacle that we'll crush wherever we find them.We've managed to destroy their easternmost fleet; but the survivors have barricaded themselves on the Derelict Strand, south of here.Our forces should've overwhelmed their make-shift defenses long ago, but we underestimated their will to live.  Seek my officers in the field, Dark Ranger Lyana and Deathstalker Razael and get them to report on the situation.11224I've heard rumors of bad happenings in the Whisper Gulch to the north. Most of the Explorers' League went down into that place, and some say they went mad with what they discovered.That doesn't change the fact that they took most of our mules and equipment with them, though. I won't lose those mules!If you find yourself in there, and happen across any of my mules, just get up close on them and threaten them with a raised hand. They'll spook and come home for sure.11227The high executor wants me to use my dogs to sniff out enemy scouts, but I can tell you right now these plaguehounds aren't going anywhere until they're properly fed.If our military doesn't understand that these beasts are picky enough to not eat the rubbish they've given me, then they can't expect them to be of any use in the field.You seem to have some time on your hands, why don't you take one of these dogs out hunting for crows out west?  Their meat isn't very tasty to us, but my boys love it!11228Fordragon's got another thing coming if he thinks the group of green-gilled scrubs he sent to defend this port can hold out much longer.You, however, might fare a bit better.The importance of holding this port cannot be stated enough; and with those monsters flying overhead, the situation around here has gone from bad to worse.Report to Vice Admiral Keller just northwest of here and let him know that you're all out of bubble gum.11229We have the Windrunner, the Queen's Reprisal and the Oblivion stationed just east of the Derelict Strand.  Send orders to the fleet's commander, Captain Harker, that they're to destroy the Alliance's cannons.Speak to our bat handler, Camille, and ask for passage to the fleet's location.  Be quick, , every minute we spend fighting the Alliance is a minute we could've spent fighting Arthas.11230This should have been a walk in the park.  Their forces are hungry, injured and ill equipped.  Yet somehow, we walked right into their trap.We approached these reefs from the south to gain cover and were immediately boarded by the Alliance dogs.I'm sorry to say, if you want our cannons to fire at anything, you're going to have to help us take our ships back.11231The captain may not care, but from the little we know, the vrykul are conducting heinous rites in some sort of 'awakening' ritual up north in Gjalerbron.They're using living sacrifices to fuel their unholy rituals!, you must put a stop to this! It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I'd bet that the vrykul hold the keys.The Light knows the last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul walking about, or worse yet, them wakening something even more evil!11232We should be able to kill our way back to our guns.  Unfortunately, visibility is less than desirable so you will have to mark our targets from the ground.Take these smoke flares with you and use them to mark the locations of the cannons along the northern wall in the Derelict Strand, west of here, where the Alliance are holding out.Let Lyana know as soon as the way is clear for the ground troops.  We can take care of ourselves over here.11233You've proven yourself in the field of battle, .  You might very well have changed the tides in our favor.I've an important assignment for you now.  I'm not sure how much longer the weakness we've exposed is going to last, so we must use the element of surprise to our advantage.I want you to use the confusion created by our attack and go behind enemy lines to assassinate their leaders.  In order of rank, they are: Captain Olster, Lieutenant Celeyne and Sergeant Lorric.  Good luck, .11234Let's send word back to old Anselm then.  Victory has come later than expected, but better late than never.  Tell him it will take our forces a few hours at most to finish off the stragglers here.Glory to the Banshee Queen!11235And now we have a different problem. My scouts that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul are up to no good at their main fortress to the north.They call the place Gjalerbron, though you'd pronounce the 'Gj' as if it were an 'Sh'. Odd creatures.But that's not important; what is, is that you get up there and put an end to the lives of as many of those creatures as you can while trying to figure out what they're up to.I know that I can count on you, .11236The Scourge are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them! They must be working to bring the vrykul into Arthas' fold.I want the leader of these necrolords eliminated!Do whatever it takes, , but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized.I will not see the vrykul successfully allied with the Scourge!Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron.11237These plans detail an imminent attack upon Westguard Keep. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead is to be used for the offensive.Surely Mage-Lieutenant Malister would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to him at the keep to the south.11238You were right to bring this to me, . You must venture to Gjalerbron and slay that wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!Even now, as we speak here, the frost wyrm may be on its way.However, if I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!And , please bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands.11239Your service has been exemplary, , but there is something that is troubling me: the Scourge.The Light cannot abide their presence, and neither shall we. I hope that it is not asking you too much, but I would have you return north to Gjalerbron and crush the unholy Scourge in that vile lair! Be sure to check for them in the Waking Halls beneath Gjalerbron as well.Purification is the key to salvation, my child. Make us proud!11240So, I hate to say it, pal, but while you were out, the captain took a keener interest in that place.Looks like he wants my old Explorers' League boss in there dead. My guess would be that we're gearing up for an offensive to clear out the rest of them, and the captain wants their head lopped off, as it were.Do me a favor? Head back into Whisper Gulch and put an end to Squeeg Idolhunter. From what I remember, my guess would be that he's in the cave in the northwest corner.11241Thanks for bailing me out of this mess, .  I was not looking forward to what these Alliance scumbags had in store for me.Let's get out of here and see if we can get back at them somehow.  Is that a campfire over there?11242Rage was my prison, , and you have freed me.  Though I thought I did right, my soul now weeps for the terror and the death I have caused the good people of Azeroth.Thank you for leading me back to the Light.  May I never again lose my way.Take this torn prayer book to an orphan matron, so the children may know that I will haunt them no more.11243If Valgarde falls, our primary supply line into Northrend will cease to exist. From there it'll only be a matter of time before we're all servants of the Lich King. Now I don't know about you, but I've got a wife and three kids back in Elwynn and I'll be damned if I'll go down without a fight.The situation here is critical and we can use all the manpower you're able to muster. Get to the front gate and help the guards defend the city against the invading monsters!11244We'd been here for a month when those malformed giants appeared out of thin air. We were ill-prepared for any sort of attack and paid dearly for our complacency. An entire archaeology team was lost and several townsfolk were abducted and taken to the ruins. We've been on the defensive ever since.To make matters worse, the scouts we sent to rescue our people have been harpooned by the vrykul and left for dead in the forest directly north of Valgarde. Dislodge those harpoons and free our scouts!11245, as we move through Skorn, we have to bring down those towers!If you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom for us!However, we do have it within our means to call in cannon volleys from Westguard Keep. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them.Just don't get too close!11246We've had reports that these vrykul can rise from the dead; not unlike the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath.Let's not take any chances.Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, you'll need to carve up the remains of the vrykul that we take down. I'd do it, but I have a sensitive stomach.I spent all morning sharpening it, so it should do the job.11247Captain Adams gave me strict instructions to make sure that a good deal of infrastructure damage was inflicted on this site.However, since you're in charge out here, that's at your discretion, .May I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn? All we have to do is get inside each and throw this torch.11248, I must now ask you to undertake an operation so hazardous, so deadly, that only you can see it through.The vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits on our eastern border. My scouts inform me that those 'giants' are poised to strike us, and with my forces scattered all over the fjord, I don't have the men to take the place by force.Instead, you're going to use your cunning. I've sent a sergeant ahead with the details. Show this command insignia at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and follow your orders.11249This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual.A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background.A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.11250We -- well, you -- have done everything that we were sent here to accomplish . I must say that it's been a pleasure taking orders from such a fine, young .The captain is sure to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I am at your disposal.11251It's come at great cost, but we've completed our inspection of the site.The news isn't good. Nearly everyone has been slain or captured. Only a few veteran guards remain unaccounted for.The scouts have done all we can here. You must pick up where we've left off.Sounds of a skirmish are coming from up the hill to the northeast. Have a look, . We can only hope there are some who have survived, and that they may have some intel we can use against this enemy.11253Now that this rascal's belly's full, maybe he will be more willing to cooperate.  Here's his leash, just come get him from his cage whenever you're ready to take him.I don't know what Anselm expects you to find, but look for clues wherever it is that the dog takes you.11254Upon closer inspection, the scroll appears to be a heavily-illustrated map of the fjord.  The location of various villages are depicted in what seem to be tribal symbols.The location of Vengeance Landing is marked with a disproportionately large skull.This map will almost certainly be of military value to High Executor Anselm.11255This battle is far from over, . If our people are still alive inside that village, someone has to go and get 'em.Head north and enter Wyrmskull Village. Once there, look for our people. If they are imprisoned you'll need to find a way to break them out.Maybe they'll have some more information about what it is that we're actually fighting.11256, the vrykul fortress, Skorn, sits to the south. Its strange giants have recently awakened and have begun to spread, attacking us wherever they can.My scouts inform me that they are poised to strike at us here, but I do not have the strength to repel such a force. Instead, we will prepare to leave north to less dangerous lands.I ask that you use your cunning to buy us time. I've sent a brave ahead with the details. Show this emblem at Skorn and he'll reveal himself and do all he can to aid you.11257Our elders say that these vrykul may be able to rise from the dead; not unlike the walking dead you call the Scourge, but a different kind of undeath.We should not take any chances.Here, take my machete. As we move through this place, carve up the remains of the vrykul that we slay.I spent the morning sharpening it, so it should cleave even through their thick bones.11258Chieftain Ashtotem ordered me to destroy many buildings here.However, you are in charge, so it falls to your hands, .I suggest that we burn down the two longhouses and the barracks that are in the lower area of Skorn. All we have to do is get inside each and set them ablaze with this torch.11259As we move through Skorn, we must destroy the towers.If you have a look at them, you'll notice that their tops are lined with casters. Getting too close to them would mean certain doom.However, we can call in wind rider air strikes from Camp Winterhoof. To do so, we need to get close enough so that you can lob a smoke flare atop of them.Just don't get too close.11260This huge scroll is made from dragon skin. Unfurling its more-than-ten-foot length, you can see that the images painted upon its scaly surface depict a mysterious vrykul ritual.A vrykul thane, surrounded by angelic-looking beings, ascends into the heavens. A mysterious, darkened figure looms large in the picture's background.A tingling in your gut tells you that the thane of Skorn is about to do this. You must stop it! A large pyre sits at the top of Skorn in front of the thane's lodge.11261You have done everything that we were sent here to do, . I must admit that you fight well. Your people are not as strange as I first thought.Chieftain Ashtotem is certain to want to hear of your success, but if you decide to stay out here for whatever reason, I will continue to fight at your side.11262Of our entire recon party, only I remain.These vrykul are relentless fighters. Given their numbers and their savage tactics, our only hope is to bring down their leader and pray it brings chaos to their ranks.Ingvar is his name. Bring me his head!11263My longrunners that have lived to return have informed me that the vrykul have awakened at their main fortress to the west.It is a forbidden place known as Gjalerbron. The longrunners tell me that the vrykul are performing strange rituals.We cannot allow this to continue.Are you willing to continue to assist us? Will you kill the vrykul at Gjalerbron before they finish whatever they are doing and attack us here?11264The dead ones are at Gjalerbron and they have necromancers with them?We must eliminate the leader of these necrolords.Do whatever it takes, , but see to it that Necro Overlord Mezhen, and whatever he's attempting to accomplish, is neutralized.We cannot afford to see the vrykul successful in whatever they are doing with these undead creatures!Look for Mezhen on the platform in the rear right section of Gjalerbron.11265From the little we know, the vrykul are conducting unnatural rites in an 'awakening' ritual to the west in Gjalerbron.They're using living sacrifices to fuel their rituals., you must stop this. It matters not who or what is in those cages, they must be freed. I would guess that the vrykul hold the keys.The last thing we need is more of those strange vrykul threatening us, or worse, them wakening something even more evil....11266These plans detail an imminent attack upon Camp Winterhoof. It would appear that the frost wyrm, Glacion, who circles overhead, is to be used for the offensive.Surely Celea Frozenmane would be of some assistance in this matter. Deliver the plans to her at the camp to the east.11267Your instincts were right to bring this to me, but my wind riders cannot fight a dragon. You must venture west to Gjalerbron and slay the frost wyrm and its master, Wyrmcaller Vile!Even now it may be on its way!If I'm reading these plans correctly, blowing the wyrmcaller's horn on his platform, outside in the rear left area of Gjalerbron, will call Glacion back. When the creature lands, destroy it!And , bring me the horn. We wouldn't want it falling back into the wrong hands!11268Your assistance to us has been tremendous, , but there is something that is troubling me: these so-called Scourge.The spirits of the land and air, the waters and the fire below the world, would not abide their presence, but seem to do nothing about them. We will see to it that they are dealt with!Perhaps it is asking too much, but I would have you return west to Gjalerbron and destroy the unnatural Scourge in that vile lair. Be sure to check in the Waking Halls below Gjalerbron as well!11269The vanguard of the Alliance force will be arriving within days. The soldiers will be expecting their winter gear to be prepared, but I've still got more cloaks to make.I've been using spotted hippogryph down for the cloaks' linings, but my stock won't last!You've got to help me, . Captain Adams will have my hide if those cloaks aren't ready in time! Bring me all the down you can find out there. It's dropped to the ground by molting hippogryphs flying over the wilderness around the fort.11270We're slowly finishing off the remnants of Stormwind's North Fleet stationed on this coast.  The bodies to the west are a testament to how brutal this confrontation has been.This does not happen to bother my refined aesthetics, but it does present a danger to our lives.In the lands of the Lich King, the dead are a weapon that can rise against us at any point in time.  Take this torch - you're going to make sure that doesn't happen.11271The down of the spotted hippogryph is prized by my people and used for everything from fletching to ceremonial clothing. We're making preparations to leave the post, so this is the last chance I'll get to gather it this season.With your help, I'll have enough to make sure everyone has the equipment they need for the long trek into the hills. Conditions worsen very quickly up there and a storm can blow in without warning.The down can be found all over the ground in the area surrounding the post.11272This elf prince thinks he can come to my town, insult my queen, kill my men and get away with it? He thinks we're going to stand by while the hordes of Utgarde build up to launch an attack?Not in a million years.You're going to walk right into Utgarde and kill him. I want Arthas to know that we've arrived and we're playing for keeps.Report to Dark Ranger Marrah inside Utgarde Keep when the deed is done and she'll tie up any... loose ends.11273We were on the brink of an archaeological breakthrough when those monsters attacked! Sadly, I was the only one to make it back to Valgarde. Now I don't know if my crew is dead or alive, but the artifacts we uncovered on that dig must be found!If you're heading into Wyrmskull Village, will you keep an eye out for my team? If there's any hope of recovering that information, we must pursue it!Search for Pulroy first. He was the last one I saw before I made my escape.11274To whomever finds this journal:These bloodthirsty monsters have taken up residence in the ruins of Wyrmskull. What they want or why they're here is a mystery. In any case, the artifacts are not safe with those beast-men around.Zedd and I made a new discovery while hiding out: a cipher to decode the tablets! Unfortunately Zedd and I were separated late last night. He had the cipher. Tablets were with Glorenfeld and Daegarn. Location unknown...Find Zedd.-Pulroy11275My people have been hunting the giant yeti of these hills for generations and I will be participating for the first time this year. It will probably be the last before we leave the post forever.To prepare for the hunt, I must fashion a loud horn from the horns of the dire rams that roam the snowy areas near our camp. The elders tell me the sound mimics the mating call of the female yeti, but I have my doubts.Bring me the best dire ram horns you can find, , and I'll select one from among them.11276There's no sign of the cipher on Zedd. After carefully searching the area you discover some writing in the dirt:\"Glor and Dae inside catacombs. Have cipher and tablets.\"Perhaps you should head into the catacombs located just north of here and search for Glorenfeld and Daegarn. The bridge crossing the worg pit will lead you right to the tunnel leading down into the catacombs.11277They're keepin' Daegarn locked up in a cage at the large fightin' ring nearby. From what I've gathered, the Dragonflayers bring out their prisoners to battle against their most powerful gladiators. They dump the losers in the basement where Scourge necromancers turn 'em into ghoulies! It's horrifying!But first things first! The tablets are strewn about all across this dungeon. Let's get those recovered before you go off tryin' to be a hero.11278'Tis a shame we lost two of our best dwarves while uncovering these relics. They sacrificed their lives to keep this information safe.Take these back to Valgarde. McSorf will know what to do with the find.As for me? I'll be alright on my own. I've gotten this far in one piece!11279This new plague that we're working on is wonderful and I think we should expand its testing.How about testing it on proto-whelps?!Just think of the possibilities. The ability to infect not only humanoids, but extend our reach to any creature!Here, I've hoarded an extra plague canister for the right time and place, and you look like the right person.Spray the eggs at Ember Clutch to the northwest, then get specimens from the plagued proto-whelps that hatch.11280Wait, that gives me an idea! What if it didn't kill the whelps because it was sprayed on the outside of their eggs?, we have to get the plague inside of them!I know! I've got some plagued meat here. Take it to the Ember Clutch and get them to eat it!But no, we're thinking too small. Let's get one of the proto-drakes flying overhead to come down and eat it.Yes!Stay close to the meat and observe what happens. Yes, it might attack you, but such is the price of progress.11281The horn has been roughed out, but before I make the traditional carvings, I want to be certain that it will work. Ahota tells me that he tests his horns at the foot of the frozen waterfall to the northeast of the post. Ahota tells me that our hunters have used the acoustics of frozen water in this way for generations. I can't wait to learn more!Will you help me test out the horn? If I've done everything right, you may even attract a yeti, so be prepared! Bring the horn back once you've tested it.11282When you've been in lots of fight like Gorth, you learn that to beat enemy good you have to make them really scared to die!But these vrykuls not afraid.  You kill one and another comes... screaming louder and with a bigger weapon than the one before.Only thing that makes vrykuls afraid is when we kill the biggest and baddest vrykul of all.Go fight the Winterskorn across the blockade until hero vrykuls show up!  Then you kill them dead and put queen's flag on corpses.  They must learn to fear!11283Them vrykuls just keeps coming and coming out from town west of here.  No end in sight!Gorth has an idea.  You go INSIDE town and kill them Winterskorn there.  THEN they stop coming here!11284Maybe if the sentries won't help me, you will? I'm the foreman of the mine just across the bridge. My men are mining ore for the weapons our expeditionary force will need to carve a path into the Grizzly Hills.A giant yeti has invaded the mine, blocking the tunnel we need to expand! We've tried yelling at him and smoking him out, but nothing's worked.Maybe you could rouse it from its sleep with a meal of meat from the frosthorn rams in the snowy areas around town? Please? We're desperate!11285Killing the Winterskorns maybe not enough.  Maybe we burn their houses too!  Uh... and their bridges.  We should burn whole town to be safe!You take this torch.  Go to Baleheim, to the west, and burn EVERYTHING!  That teach them good.11286I came out here for a different reason; an old friend of mine has been calling to me in my dreams. But now that I see these small things with their machines making a big hole in the ground, it makes my blood boil.From what I can see, these dwarves, as they are known, are digging up artifacts; artifacts that could be important to our past.I want you to go down there and get these things for me. Don't let any of those dwarves stand in your way.11287, I grow worried that my son, Sage Mistwalker, has been gone for such a long time. The land is cruel and deadly.He spoke of a recurring vision that he had of a wolf, and went west with a small group of longrunners to seek its source. I believe the name of the place he mentioned was Steel Gate.Will you find him? I want to make sure that no ill has befallen him.11288I am an envoy of the Argent Crusade, charged with a sacred duty.Our forces were decimated in the Plaguelands. By the light of dawn, the artifact was cleansed and made pure once more. So many perished in the wake of its redemption.There is still a chance... still time.The artifact was hurled into the den of the fallen, far below us. Guarded by the unmerciful dead.Light. Will. Protect. You.11289Glory to the Light. You have done it!Take the artifact and return it to Valgarde. Lord Irulon Trueblade awaits its return.Fight with honor, friend. Always. Honor.11290While we were able to gather very little information as to the whereabouts of Ingvar, we do know that Yanis resides in a cave next to the worg pit inside Wyrmskull Village.Intelligence gathered from the rescued soldiers indicates that Yanis guards Dragonflayer battle plans.I need you to go back to Wyrmskull and recover those plans. Kill any vrykul that get in your way - including Yanis!11291We've got all the information we need to keep Valgarde protected. You must take these battle plans to Westguard Keep, located on the western fjord cliff wall. Speak with the flight master assistant, Emilune Winterwind. She will put you on the back of a gryphon headed towards Westguard.Once there, find Captain Adams. He's the one in charge. Adams will know what to do with these plans.11292Glad to meet you. I've come here from the Grizzly Hills to do business with your cohorts. My people maintain a large outpost there, and you'd do well to visit it when you head north.I've set up traps in the woodlands and snowy areas around here. With the meat and the furs from the creatures they capture, I'll have plenty to barter with the townspeople.I can offer you a share of my profits if you're willing to help gather prey from the traps. Beware though, you won't be the only predator out there.11293We need to get the word out about the Barleybrews at Brewfest.  You need to shout at the flags outside the bank, in the Military Ward, in the Hall of Explorers and in the Mystic Ward.  I'll make things easy though, I'll lend you a racing ram for 4 minutes.  Use the reins to let him go, but try not to tire him out.11294It's time to let people know that the Thunderbrew have heard their cries for good brew.  You need to shout at the flags outside the bank, in the Military Ward, in the Hall of Explorers and in the Mystic Ward.We'll make it easy though.  We'll lend you a ram for 4 minutes.Be careful with going too fast though since you won't find any apple crates in Ironforge...  We can't take the chance of helping out the Barleybrew messengers.11295No one seems to know very much about the vrykul.  Our records show no signs of activity in their lands for centuries.  Yet here they are, just as we move against Arthas.The map you retrieved makes it clear that we'll have to defeat them if our forces are to get any further into Northrend.One of my best sergeants, an abomination known as Gorth, oversees the blockade beyond the lift.  Assist him in launching a pre-emptive strike on Baleheim.  If a vrykul attack occurs, it will be launched from there.11296Something, most likely the walking dead known as the Scourge, has agitated the creatures hereabouts.While escorting the sage here, we lost most of our hunting force to the riven widows -- huge and deadly spiders, which inhabit the Rivenwood to the north.I must stay here to protect the small force we have left, but you... you could see if my longrunners are still alive, trapped within the riven widow's cocoons.Would you do this, stranger?11297Even the earth cannot hold back the tide of death washing over it. Corpses walk the land, spreading their putrefaction with alarming speed.A small expedition has made its way up the western cliffs and rests near Whisper Gulch. Take a look for yourself, . See if you can learn their purpose and dissuade them from bringing their poisons into our lands. Travel southwest from the post, toward the cliffs overlooking the western beach. Their camp will be west of the excavation at Steel Gate.11298To the southeast is an area called Whisper Gulch. It's overrun with members of the Explorers' League who've gone mad! They attacked our caravan as it passed through the area, and they've harried our foraging parties as well.I must know what's causing this madness! I suspect that whatever they're drinking from the kegs scattered around the gulch contributes to their insanity. I want you to steal the kegs from those dwarves while they're busy mining away.11299You might have already seen the room where Daegarn is being held while you were gatherin' the tablets. It's through this corridor and then down a set of steps. Daegarn will be in the room at the bottom of the steps - locked up tight!Get down there and find him. At the very least you might be able to get the cipher from him.11300Oluf will come out if you defeat the other gladiators. That's 'bout the only way we're getting' that cipher back. Put on your whompin' boots and get busy in the Ring of Judgement. If you do manage to get the cipher back, return it to Glorenfeld o'er near the entrance to these catacombs.Me? Don't worry about me! We're on the brink of discovering the missing link to human-kind!11301Has Malthus drawn you in with his blather about beer kegs and crazy dwarves?I'm not questioning that the dwarves are crazy, but I don't think stealing their beer is going to do any good.What we need is brains. Lots of brains. We'll get down to the bottom of this mystery in no time, and perhaps even find a new component for the plague.Take this saw, go southeast into the Whisper Gulch, and kill yourself some dwarves. Use the saw to help you harvest the brains and bring them back here.11302When we first scouted locations for the fort, we encountered hostile creatures at two of the glades here in the north. When we passed the snow-covered one directly south of the town, the dryads there watched us with interest, but did not attack.We were tired and worn down by the weather. They could've easily killed several of our men, but they didn't.Perhaps, in reaching out to them, we might discover unexpected allies. Are you willing to travel to the Frozen Glade and make contact with them?11303The vrykuls in Baleheim is completely defeated, no doubt about it.  But still their leader stays in town and won't give up.Gorth sends Lydell and his assassins to make good ambush to the northwest.  You talk to Lydell and figure out how to get Vrykul chieftain to come out.  Then you kill him.  You kill him real good.11304I'm afraid our equipment isn't exactly the best here at Vengeance Landing.  After all it's a military controlled outpost.I will need you to take a sample of this strain to Chief Plaguebringer Harris in New Agamand, follow the road beyond Baleheim south and then west.  They have better equipment there - he will know what to do.You must hurry, .  Our enemies are stronger and more numerous than us.  We need to develop a viable weapon against them!11305We've been spraying down the vrykul village of Halgrind for weeks now and the vrykul just won't drop dead.Let's face it, , by now our Plague has been exposed to humans, dwarves, dogs, livestock... you name it.  As our strains adapt to their hosts, more impurities get thrown in the mix.  What we need is a strain made custom for the vrykul's biology.Halgrind's chieftain fled the town after we took it over; you'll find him west of here.  As a patriarch of the Dragonflayer clan, his blood is ideal.11306You've done well so far, .  I'd like to teach you some of my more advanced techniques, so that you gain a better understanding of the plague.Take this empty flask and fill it with blood from the cauldron to my left.  Mix it with the plague samples to my right until you obtain a well balanced mix.11307Now that we have a strain of the plague that has adapted to vrykul carriers, we really ought to test it on our specimens in Halgrind.  If all goes according to plan, they will disintegrate immediately as the plague devours their innards!You will find Halgrind north of here.  Our plaguebringers are deploying the previous strain there - shouldn't be hard to spot.11308Being the practical man that I am, I'm going to declare our research here a success.  After all, what army can't be stopped by turning its rank and file against each other?I will send word of our achievements to Vengeance Landing soon enough.  But first I need you to take care of cleaning up our experimentation site.See \"Hacksaw\" Jenny about making you a custom abomination.  One packing some explosive power if you catch my drift.11309So Harris wants a demolition job, eh?  Yeah, I can help out.You're gonna have to get me some parts, though.  I can't afford to use up my choice components on something that's gonna get blown up.First of all, I'm going to need shoveltusk ligaments... way better than the human kind.I will also need a pound of flesh.  A fellow known as Anton sells cheap meat.  He travels up and down the road to the west.11310Well, here you are!  Our friend's going to be somewhat... unstable.  So I suggest not putting him together until reaching Halgrind.Once you're there, use the abomination to round up as many vrykul as you can before self-destructing.Come back with whatever's left once you're done.  I can always use more body parts!11311If you are to survive here, as we have, you must learn to face the environment's challenges head on. The elements will claim your life if you're not vigilant, as the proliferation of elementals in these northern hills shows.We must cull the elementals one last time before we can leave this place. Are you willing to aid us while we continue to make preparations?You must kill any iceshard elementals or howling cyclones you encounter in the snowy hills surrounding the outpost.11312For generations, my people have told tales of frost nymphs cavorting in glades hidden away in the wilderness. I used to search for them as a child, against the advice of my parents, until I nearly froze to death.These days, it isn't necessary to comb the forests for them. They've decided to reveal themselves for reasons I can only guess, but I don't think the change can be ignored. Venture southeast to the Frozen Glade and seek out the nymphs, but beware; you will pass the Twisted Glade on your way.11313The ice elementals surrounding our glade were once our companions, but a volatile and destructive force has swept through the land, turning them against us!This is but one of the horrors my sisters and I have endured. We have revealed ourselves to you in the hope that you will help us stave off the decay that has crept into our glades and poisoned our sisters!We've been gathering the cores of the ice elementals and keeping them safe so that one day, we might be able to restore them. Will you help?11314To the southwest was a glade that used to look much like this one. Mysterious forces and alien magics are reshaping the land. The glade has thawed, the sisters living there driven mad by the sudden change.We thought to reach out to them, but they attacked us. I fear many may be beyond saving, but I cannot give up hope.Take my pendant, travel southwest to the Vibrant Glade, and use it to try to free my sisters.11315The sisters who lived in the Vibrant Glade, to the southwest, used to tend to gorgeous beds of scarlet ivy, but the same force that has driven them mad has transformed their beloved ivy.The vines now grasp at the feet of the unwary, or lash at any who approach the glade. Before we can reclaim the glade, the vines must be tamed and uprooted.Clear as much of the ivy as you are able. It has already begun to grow out of control.11316The glade to the west has been transformed into a hideous place called the Twisted Glade. Horrible beasts dwell among the trees, stones, and pool of the glade.I cannot guess where the creatures came from or what horrible forces animate them, but they must be dealt with!I fear that if they are allowed to dominate the glade, they will poison it beyond redemption. Clear the glade of these creatures who murdered our sisters.11317We braved the Rivenwood because of my troubled dreams concerning my worg life-friend, Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him.But, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.First, you must cleanse your inner turmoil.There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, northeast of Camp Winterhoof. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.Meditate there and then return to me.11318So you want to check out the racing rams?  Well I hope you're ready for speed.  BUT before I let you loose in the world, you'll need to show me that you can handle these fine creatures.So here's the deal:  I'll lend you some racing reins and the use of a ram. You need to prove to me that you can handle using these rams.Keep the ram at a trot, canter and gallop for 8 seconds each.  If you need instructions how to handle the ram, talk to my apprentice, Pol Amberstill.11319The glade to the northwest, now the Twisted Glade, used to be home to a number of keepers of the glade. Together with the sisters, they saw to the glade's upkeep.When the glade changed, the sisters died, but somehow the keepers managed to survive. Now, they seed the land with poisonous spores that wither healthy greenery.I'll give you one of the cores from the ice elementals. Once you've destroyed a spore, use the ice crystal to freeze it and keep it from regenerating.11322Of late I've had nightmares concerning a worg named Ulfang. He has called out for help, and you must go to him.However, you do not have the means to speak with him, or walk amongst the other worgs. I know a way.But first, you must cleanse your inner turmoil through meditation.There is a shrine that sits at the top of Frostblade Peak, far to the northeast. A single path leads up to it from the western base of the mountain.Meditate there to cleanse yourself and then return to me.11323From my dreams, I know that Ulfang is in a cave on the snowy northwestern edge of the Rivenwood.He is in great danger.I have devised a magical disguise that will make you appear as a worg while you are within the Rivenwood.

The horns of the frostwing chimaera that make their home in the snowy parts of the island are sharp and are easily crafted into spear tips.  Bring me the best of these horns that you can find.11458The totem of Issliruk is ready, , and for that I thank you.  We must cast our peaceful ways for the time being and strike at those who've attacked our land and our kin.The pirate slavers that raided Iskaal have lost their minds and slaughtered all their captives.  Go to Iskaal, to the east of here and do what must must be done.  Take this horn and call on my brethren should you need assistance.11459Is like dis, mon.

Galang, bucko.11460The first and most important factor in falconry is the bond between the falconer and  bird. Trust must be earned by the master!If you are to earn their trust you will first need to fill their bellies.The fjord rock falcon, as these birds are known, primarily eat grubs. Throughout the fjord you will find loose rocks that serve as breeding grounds for these grubs. Find a grub and return here to feed the falcons in the cage.11464I heard you did a little work for Terry.  I was hoping someone reliable would show up around these parts.See, pirates love to gamble.  They, however, do not love to pay their gambling debt.If you're interested in collecting some coin on my behalf, I'd be willing to give you a cut.Let's start you out with an easy one.  \"Silvermoon\" Harry's a bit of an eccentric, keeps all sorts of expensive blood elf knickknacks inside his tent - yet when I see him he always pretends to be broke.  Get my gold.11465I was leading a caravan here from Valgarde that was attacked by Dragonflayers. I was the only survivor of that ambush. Unfortunately, I couldn't make it back here with the cargo of fjord turkeys. This is the perfect opportunity for you to get your feet wet with your rock falcon.Take this falcon cage and head west down the road leading out of this camp. Use the falcon to capture the loose turkeys and return here when you've gathered enough.Remember to feed the falcon!11466Our next customer,  Jack Adams, won't be the pushover that Harry was.  He spends all day drinking with his friends, tough pirates all of them.  Let's not use force this time, could get ugly.See if you can use his drinking habit to your advantage.  There's only so much alcohol someone can handle before passing out.Maybe one of the bar wenches will be of assistance.  Once he's out, see if you can slip your hand into his pocket and get what's mine.11467You might've heard of Black Conrad, he's a famous pirate around these parts.Well, he had a thing for gambling on my fights.  He had a thing for not paying, too.I'd love to collect, but trouble is... he's dead.I was about ready to write the whole thing off, when I came across this...He hid his treasure on tuskarr land.  I want you to get it.  I'll be damned if I let that bilge sucker get away without paying.11468Do you feel the closeness, ? Surely you feel a true bond forming between you and your falcon. Would you believe me if I told you that when the time is right you'll be able to see through the eyes of your bird? Aye, it is the ultimate level of falconry.But first you must hunt more! The bird must hone and quicken its reflexes. Send it against a more formidable opponent! The fjord hawks of the region make the tops of the trees around us their homes. They shall be your next target!11469Yeah, I got to get the deck swabbed spotless afore Mad Jonah comes 'round. An' I ain't gonna do it on my hands and knees neither!Problem is, we're all outa soap. That's more your problem than mine though, mate. Being the newbie 'round here, I gots a special trip for ya to make.Up on the northwest coast of this island, there's a whole mess o' sea lions. Amongst the nearby ice floes you'll find the alpha bull, Big Roy. Bring me back his blubber and I'll magic-up the best soap ya ever seen!11470You are most definitely ready for the next step in falconry, .Take your trained falcon east of here, to the vrykul hawk roost near the Stonewall Lift. From the roost you will send out your falcon to steal the eggs of the hawks. Their nests will be located in remote areas of the cliff walls surrounding the roost. Locate those nests and use your falcon to scavenge for the eggs!Beware the fjord hawk matriarchs, . Should you come under attack, use your falcon's escape and soar abilities to flee!11471I know why you're here, .  You've been sent to kill our leader, Jonah Sterling.I'd like to offer my help.  Jonah's leadership threatens our operation.Attacking the Horde and the Alliance fleets simultaneously?  Suicidal.  Trying to sell the tuskarr as slaves when they die days after leaving this climate?  Disastrous.Jonah's hideout is located inside a cave west of here.  Bring me his spyglass as proof of the deed and my first action as leader will be to end all attacks against your allies.11472The Northsea Pirates slaughtered the isles' alpha sea lion bull, Big Roy. They made soap from him to clean the decks of their ships!Now the sea lions won't mate. Help me to repopulate their numbers.The reef bulls can be found at the Twin Shores to the southeast. They crave the tasty reef fish that can be found on the east and west sides of the isles.Take this net and gather enough fish, at least a dozen -- maybe more, to lure a bull across the strait to a reef cow.11473Our second in command, Annie Bonn, has been acting rather paranoid as of late.  She seems sure we have an infiltrator in our ranks, can ye believe it?Anyhow, we have a foolproof way of uncovering rats around these parts.  See, good ole' Zeh'gehn over here happens to be an authentic witch doctor.  His family hails all the way from Zul... something or other.Go let him know that we're in need of his divination skills.  I must warn ye, , only one or two of us can understand anything Zeh'gehn says.11474As usual, the real work is left up to me and my crew. Thankfully McSorf's team didn't die for nothin'. The cipher they recovered will help us crack the stuff we've found up here - that is if we can ever get back to it! Damned iron dwarves have sprung up like leaks all over the place and are now attemptin' to bury the sites! Can you believe it? Bastards want to bury our finds!Anyhow, talk to Walt over yonder. He'll get you started.11475I've been studying this deactivated construct for days, . I think I can create a reasonable facsimile of the golem that would have room inside to fit one passenger. The idea being that it would fool those iron dwarves and allow us to get inside Baelgun's.Now I'm not gonna be able to make anything with a hammer and poker. I need my tools! Unfortunately I left those behind at Ivald's Ruin when the iron dwarves first attacked. Get me my tools!Ivald's Ruin is located far to the northeast.11476Some of the pirates around here... we have our own special way of talking.  Zeh'gehn has... many different special ways of talking... all mixed together.From what I can tell he wants a frog and a knife.\"Silvermoon\" Harry might have a knife on the cheap.  There's frogs all over town, just grab one and bring it to him along with the knife.I'd hate to be in the poor critter's shoes, if you know what I mean.11477Keep it down, . These iron dwarves are quick on the trigger. Now don't let the activities down in the dig fool you. Those steel-skinned abominations aren't digging anything up! No sir - on the contrary - they're burying the site! For whatever whacked out reason, they don't want anyone finding this place.What kind of dwarf buries ancient relics and dig sites? I'll tell you what kind: the kind you kill with reckless abandon! Get in there and take 'em out!11478I see that you haven't visited my brothers at the Explorers' League Outpost south of here. Why don't you do Donny a favor and deliver this message to Stanwad. He'll be interested to hear about the activities of the iron dwarves up here.Like I said, mount up and start heading south. You'll see the outpost right before you get to Baelgun's.11479Croaker's spoken, matey. \"Crowleg\" Dan's on da ship yonder.Best go trace that blaggard, mon.  Show'im dis set's not fe be crossed.  Gaan back fe Terry when ye keelhaul 'is behind.11480All the good work you've done for us hasn't gone unnoticed, .  Our second in command, the delightful Annie Bonn, is incredibly impressed with what you've done so far and wants to meet you.11481By the naaru, I thank you, , for your efforts.Our work is far from finished, however, and I must request that you undertake a critical mission - one as important as any I've issued.Our forces are spread thinly. To compound the strain, we've had to dispatch a contingent to Azeroth to investigate developments at the Sunwell Plateau.You are needed there, . Report to Larethor. Tell him that I wish we could spare more men.11482Hear me, .Duty requires that you return to Azeroth. Every able person is to report to the Sunwell Plateau immediately.I'm afraid I have no more information to share, except this:You'll be joining forces with the Aldor for this mission. Speak with a draenei by the name of Larethor when you arrive.Apparently, the situation calls for us to set our differences aside and join forces.Prepare yourself, friend. This sounds serious.11483Tools? Check. Materials? Negative.If we're going to build this thing, you're going to have to get me the materials.First things first, . For the skeletal structure I'm going to need a large barrel from Nifflevar, some dark iron ingots from Valgarde, and industrial strength rope from Baleheim.Nifflevar and Baleheim are vrykul towns northwest of here. Valgarde is located in Daggercap Bay, also to the northwest. Speak with McGoyver to get the ingots. He'll fly you back here once you're all done.11484While the infrastructure for a piece of machinery like this is important, we can't underestimate the appearance of the construct. If we're to fool the iron dwarves the clone must be exact!I can make this happen.Bring me a pristine shoveltusk hide from the shoveltusk of this region and steel ribbing from vrykul in Nifflevar or Baleheim to the northwest.11485Alright, ; the time has come for you to climb inside this thing and learn how to use its basic abilities. When you're ready, get on the work bench and I'll get you situated inside the construct.Your first lesson is going to be using the construct's transportation system. You'll notice that the iron dwarves have set up special rune carvings around the dig site. Their constructs use those rune carvings to power up and fly from point to point. Try it with the rune carving I built here.11489The most important part of your job while controlling the construct is the collection of data. I've placed an iron dwarf relic in the cart over yonder. It's the floating, lightning infused crystal.Get on the work bench and I'll put you back in the construct. Once you're back in the driver's seat, use the construct's data collection ability to pick up the test data.11490Go to the terrace... use the orb.Hurry... they must be stopped... before they can....11491You always gotta have a contingency plan in case your main plan backfires! That's why I've built in some anti-intelligence systems into the construct.Your shiny new ride might rouse some suspicion while you're at Baelgun's excavation site. That's what your bluff ability is for! Just use that any time you're confronted and you'll be safe from harm.Test it out on Lebronski by walking on his rug. Once he starts huffin' and puffin', use the bluff!Get on the work bench when you're ready to begin.11494Your construct is ready to go. All abilities have been given a once over and I've programmed the machine to both comprehend and speak the language of the titans.Take the construct to Baelgun's Excavation Site, due south of here, and collect data from the lightning infused relics that litter the site. Remember to bluff any iron dwarves that suspect your construct to be a fake. And don't forget about rocket jumping from rune to rune to get around in there!Get on the table when you're ready!11495The cavern that we opened at Baelgun's was the one place that most steered clear of... Can't say I blame 'em. The sound of thunder shot out of that cave, ! Loud, booming thunder!I think near the end, it was abandoned by all. Bad, bad things happened to any that went in to explore - most never coming back.I want you to check that cave out while you're at Baelgun's. Explore around the titan statue inside and report back with your findings.11496Our first priority is to capture the Sun's Reach Sanctum.  Once we've secured it, we'll be able to use its energy to open a portal from Shattrath.The sanctum is overrun with the Wretched - former blood elves who've devolved into mindless husks of their former selves.  Its defenses would've normally prevented this intrusion, but the Wretched have stolen the power sources from the protective wards.Hunt down the Wretched and get the mana remnants they carry.  Use them to energize the sanctum wards.11497Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying  own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place.I understand the feeling completely.You, my friend, need to head to Wildhammer Stronghold in the southwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Ilsa Blusterbrew about some flight instruction. Mind you, her training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while.11498Though it may end up hurting my business in the long run, you look the sort that dreams of flying  own mount through the skies, rather than being flown from place to place.I understand the feeling completely.You, my friend, need to head to Shadowmoon Village in the northwest corner of Shadowmoon Valley. When you get there, speak with Olrokk about some flight instruction. Mind you, his training's not cheap. But, I think that you'll find it worth your while.11501Westguard needs to know what's going on here, . I want you to personally deliver the news to Captain Adams.Whenever you're ready, let me know and I'll put you back in the construct for one final flight. It'll take you to Westguard Keep, but more than likely blow up in the process.It's been a pleasure...11502We are not a warlike race, .  However when war comes to our lands, we do not run away from it.The Alliance and the Horde wage war in the city of Halaa, to the northwest. We do not know what the blood elves are scheming, but any victory for the Horde would be disastrous.  The history between our people and the orcs is one of bloodshed and betrayal.Go and slay the enemy in Halaa and you will be rewarded in coin, honor and renown.11503Our ancient enemy, the draenei, have returned with powerful allies.  They wage war in Halaa, southwest of here.We cannot allow them a victory there as Garadar would be next without a doubt.Go and slay those who would aid our ancient enemy.11504The path east of us is a primary hunting trail of the tuskarr. At least that's what it used to be...More recently our hunters have been returning to Kamagua claiming that the dead have risen and are out for blood! That is what has brought my son and me here. Elder Atuik asks that we find resolution in the bluffs.Will you assist us in our time of need? I seek heroes willing to brave the perils of Shield Hill, southeast of here. Search the desecrated graves for clues and return your findings to me.11505Auchindoun's spirits have no stake in the conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, but incurring their favor will give our side an edge in the region.Ancient custom directs the living to pay their respects at spirit towers in the Bone Wastes - though only at specific times of the day.  If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will have helped bring the spirits to our side.Should we succeed in gaining the spirits' favor, they will grant us a boon that will aid us in our endeavors.11506The draenei might be our enemies, but the spirits of their ancestors in Auchindoun are restless and have no allegiance.The draenei's custom required them to pay their respects at spirit towers at various times during the day.  If you can help secure a tower during these times, you will help the spirits return to peace in Auchindoun.The Alliance will try to capture the towers in order to secure the dead's favor.   We must ensure that our side succeeds instead.11507My people are bitterly entrenched in a war with the Northsea Freebooters. If any tuskarr could help us in our quest to right the wrongs of the pirates, it will be Elder Atuik of Kamagua. You must take these clues to him at once.To get to Kamagua you must take the Ancient Lift, behind me. Take the lift directly to Kamagua and find Elder Atuik.11508The pirate thieves have set up port at Scalawag Point, far to the south. Unfortunately, they have fortified their camp with many deadly defenses.There is someone that might be able to assist us in infiltrating Scalawag.A pirate mercenary by the name of Grezzix Spindlesnap recently came to our village in search of food and shelter. In exchange he gives us information about our enemies and feeds them misinformation about our attack plans. Seek him out at his ship just off the coast here - southwest.11509The Northsea Freebooters all fear and respect Grezzix. I'm thinking they recognize my special talents and envy my amazing ship. All you need to do is tag along with my cabin boy, Lou, and you'll be in like... In like tin. Pirates love tin.Just talk to Lou when you're ready to go and he'll take you to Scalawag.Oh yea, you'll want to talk to \"Silvermoon\" Harry first. He'll have more information on the stuff they pilfered. Just watch what you say around him. He's a freak... crazy for blood elves.11510One of the first things Jonah Sterling did after he went crazy was to take my prized sin'dorei scrying crystal and feed it to the bane of my existence, \"Scoodles\" the orca.No I didn't name the damned thing. I just know that she swims out past the ships directly southeast of Scalawag. Kill that overinflated goldfish and rip out my beautiful sin'dorei crystal from its stomach.Do this and we can get down to business.11511Those artifacts are cursed and you'd be crazy to go looking for them, . I know for certain that anyone that's come into direct contact with any of those items has either gone mad or been killed.Take that staff, for example. Last I heard the ship that held it was abandoned and left to rot on the coast of the Isle of Spears, north of here.If you want that thing, check the ship's hold.Whatever you do, don't bring that staff back here! And steer clear of Abdul! He'll tear your heart out.11512Some say Jonah was never quite right in the head, but I know the truth. It was the heart. That damned frozen heart! I saw the change in him the second he pulled it from the grave. I could see the blood freeze in his veins... It was then that the madness truly took over.He left us to hole up in his cave on the north side of this island. Last I heard he had thrown the heart in the back of his bear den. Too little, too late...I'll kill you myself if you even think about bringing that heart back here!11513I have devised a plan to acquire a power source strong enough for the creation of our portal.The ethereal forces at Bash'ir Landing, atop the northwestern Blade's Edge Mountains, have been smuggling mana cells out of Tempest Keep and transporting them to the Sunwell for Kael'thas.They have hidden the cells, but there is a way for you to find them; the ethereal carry phase devices that you can use to see the smuggled goods.Just beware the mana cells' phase wyrm guardians.11514We must maintain the energy to our portal or it will collapse. The mana cells that the ethereals at Bash'ir Landing have hidden will continue to serve our purposes. The landing sits atop the northwestern corner of the Blade's Edge Mountains, far to the north.Remember, acquire a phase device from one of the ethereals and then use it to locate the smuggled goods.Just be cautious of the phase wyrms that they use to guard the mana cells.11515When Kael's forces retreated through that portal, his most loyal lackeys were rewarded with an abominable gift.  They  stayed behind and gorged themselves on the blood of demons for days.The blood has changed them, given them new powers.  It will also prove their undoing.Obtain blood samples from other demons.  Use them to power this fel siphon and deprive these arrogant fools of their new powers.  Slay them in their weakened state and return to me.11516We have to shut down this gateway to stop Legion reinforcements to the Isle of Quel'Danas.Take these embers, they contain one of my creations: a living flare.  It is designed to act as a powerful destructive force - as long as it has been provided enough energy.Find the fel sparks that wander the area and slay them near the living flare.  The flare will grow in power each time, until it becomes unstable.Once you've achieved this bring the flare to the gateway.  It will know what to do.11517I am most glad that you are here, ! Now that we have taken this sanctum, we must hurry to create a magical portal that will lead to here from Shattrath City in the Outland.My liege lord, Exarch Nasuun, is heading up the Offensive's efforts to do just that. He asked me to send along any promising candidates who have what it takes to help with the portal's creation.Please, travel to Shattrath City and speak with him inside A'dal's chamber on the Terrace of Light.11519If you listen real close you can hear cannon fire coming from the northeast.

We'll build defenses around the other structures, but the Wretched are stubborn and continue to steal power from the crystal wards.Hunt them down and get the mana remnants they carry.  Use the remnants to energize the sanctum wards; the safety of our operation depends on it.11524We lack the numbers to capture the Sanctum at Sun's Reach, but I've a plan that will tip the scales in our favor.The loose energy from the Sunwell has caused the sentries that patrol this island to malfunction.  The crystal cores that control their behavior are damaged beyond repair.I've crafted new crystals that will bring them under our control; place them inside of the hulls of defeated sentries.  We will need all the help we can get.11525My plan to replace the damaged crystals on the erratic sentries has been a success.  We've managed to take the Sun's Reach Sanctum with their help.I've crafted new crystals that will bring more of them under our control; place them inside the hulls of defeated sentries.  We'll deploy them to other locations once they're converted.11526We sent one of our operatives to investigate the fel portal in the middle of Dawning Square, south of here.

The cost was high and many brave combatants gave their lives so we could achieve this.It is my goal to ensure that those who perished in combat are not forgotten.  I ask that you take a moment to consider making a donation towards a memorial fund.  Any leftover gold will go to the widows and orphans of the fallen.11546Welcome, .There are a number of ways I can assist you in your efforts here.For example, I've recently discovered a recipe for a unique elixir.The bloodberry grows wild in many regions of Azeroth and has long been considered nothing more than a nuisance.

What was he thinking taking a caravan through a taunka burial mound?Still, what's done is done. Now it is up to us to deal with the consequences.Overlord Bor'gorok asked me to help Longrunner Proudhoof in any way that I can. The longrunner has asked that we lay to rest the spirits of his ancestors.What do you say, ? Are you  enough to handle such a simple task?11595Hellscream has the weight of the Horde upon his shoulders.

Should the Nerubians take down our inner defenses, we will be overrun by the undead legions of Arthas.We can't let that happen - which is why you're going on the offensive and slaughtering the Nerubians in the quarry.Blood and thunder, soldier! Take 'em both with you.11599I recently received word from William Allerton, a family friend, that my brother enlisted here in Valiance Keep on the same day he did.  Thing is... my brother's been dead for years.I sold everything I owned to come looking for Thassarian, only to be stonewalled by the local bureaucracy.  I've even been threatened with arrest if I keep snooping around.I need someone in the good graces of the higher-ups... someone like you.  If you can help me, I heard that William's stationed at the Farshire mine.11600William's neck has been cut by a sharp object.Further inspection reveals a single clue to bring to Leryssa - an enlistment card bearing the name of William Allerton.11601Poor Mr. Allerton might yet help us find my brother.I borrowed it, ok?  Let's see, does that enlistment card have a date?William saw Thassarian at the enlistment line.  Their entries must be near each other... here it is!He was assigned to... Unit S?  All the other military units are named after Alliance towns.Who's in the unit?  Where are they deployed?  We need rumors.  See if the innkeeper's heard anything.11602Aerial reconnaissance of the quarry reports that the Nerubians are storing their eggs on the scaffolding surrounding the base. Smart beasts these are... They're keeping the eggs high and dry, away from the epicenter of conflict.You're going to have to go back out there and track down their eggs. Find 'em, smash 'em, and trash 'em.Each egg destroyed means twenty less Nerubians feeding on our corpses.11603The military was all that old man Colburn had.  After he retired, he still clung to it like a lifeline.He knows the name of every general, unit, brigade, detachment... you name it.  He's the man you need.Problem is, his mind is scarred.  He won't talk to anyone unless he gets his Kul Tiras wine.  Takes him back to the times he was a marine.I haven't received a shipment in months.  The last merchant ship out of Kul Tiras sunk northeast of here.  See if you can salvage a bottle to bring Colburn.11604Unit S... Unit S.... hmmmpph.... don't make any sense... it oughta be named after a town...Darkshire was sent to Dragonblight.  The Goldshire boys were sent to the Fjord.   Where did I hear...Oh, yes... the deserter!  There's a turn-tail in the barracks prison.  Got thrown in not too long ago.  Kept saying that \"S\" stood for suicide.Look for the deserter.  He might have some information for you.11605Do not be startled, stranger. I am Elder Atkanok, an ancient ancestor of the tuskarr people, a skilled craftsman in my own time and the guardian of this quarry for centuries.The quarry has been overrun, leaving many statues unfinished while the ancestors' spirits wander the world. Will you aid me in righting this wrong?First, I must know the names of these wandering ancestors. Look for the markers near their statues.11606We can kill all the Nerubians that we see and destroy all the eggs that we find, but those things won't stop coming until we blow their tunnels and passageways up. Of course, we can't do that without some heavy grade munitions. Unfortunately, most of our stockpile is being used up by the goblins and blacksmiths for our siege tanks and weaponry.We do happen to have a pretty good supply of the stuff out in Mightstone Quarry - underneath all the Nerubian crap. You'll just have to go out and get it for me.11607In the attack on the quarry, the shaman and craftsmen working here were slain. The violence threw the spirit world into utter chaos and we'll be unable to guide the ancestors home unless we find a way to soothe the spirits of the murdered.The aggressors themselves pay no heed to the spirits, but their companions, the beryl hounds, sense the spirits and hold them in thrall.Kill the beryl hounds, and using the raw energy left behind, break the imprisonment of the spirits of the innocent.11608North, south, east and west. Those are the locations that you should be concerned about. Surrounding this fortress, within Mightstone Quarry, are four perfectly situated Nerub'ar sinkholes.Be very careful with that package, . Mishandle it and you'll be dog meat.Inside the bundle are seaforium depth charges. Get to each of those Nerub'ar sinkholes and plant a depth charge at their center point. If all goes well, the tunnels will collapse.Get a move on!11609With the spirits of the murdered craftsmen and shaman at rest, the way is clear for us to complete the ceremonies interrupted by the attack. You must perform a role traditionally reserved for a tuskarr shaman, and you must possess all the necessary ritual items.There is no time to craft new ones, so you will need to scour the quarry for those left by the victims of the attack. Handle these objects with care, , for some are centuries old. You may need to wrest them from the hands of the invaders.11610With your help, the ancestor spirits can now be guided to their rightful homes, the statues lovingly prepared by Kaskala's craftsmen and shaman.The ceremonies for these ancestors were interrupted during the attack on the quarry, and you will need to complete them. Take with you the objects that you recovered from the quarry, stand in front of the statues with the name markers, and recite this chant.11611Peons... We may as well post up a sign offering the Nerub'ar a free meal.See, the problem with a peon is that: (1) they're dumber than dirt; and (2) they're weaker than a leper gnome. Of course they're the first to be taken by the Scourge!This puts me in a bit of a predicament, you see. Without peons, manual labor comes to a halt. No peons, no construction.Find and release my peons, . If they're alive, you'll find 'em spun up in webbing throughout Mightstone Quarry.11612You're a welcome sight, . My name is Etaruk, and I used to be a craftsman here at the Coldrock Quarry.My companions and I were preparing a new set of statues for their last set of rites when we saw those mysterious blue platforms come flying over the plateau.When they landed, the mages they carried swarmed the quarry, murdering my fellows and plundering the quarry. If we don't stop them, they'll destroy our statues and make off with our artifacts. Will you help me defeat the invaders?11613They call themselves the Kvaldir.  My people have legends about them; we call them the tuk-hariq - walkers of the fog.My village was destroyed by these giant mist-men.  Everyone I knew was slain, including my father Ariut.By tuskarr law I must seek retribution against those who shed my kin's blood.I am but a fisherman and I've not yet passed the test of manhood... I cannot stand toe-to-toe with the vile Kvaldir.If you were to carry out my blood duty for me, I will be in great debt to you.11614We are here by order of Varimathras! The mission of the Shadowstalkers is a simple one: spy. Well, spy with a little assassination on the side.One of my best field agents has gone missing. I haven't heard from him in days, which has left me fearing the worst. No, not death! Death would be ideal. I fear he may have gone rogue... turned traitor even.His last known location was northern Mightstone Quarry. He was gathering intelligence on the Nerubians. Find him.He better be dead...11615You skim through the pages of the book, looking for anything of importance. On the last page you discover what appears to be frantic scribbling:Necrolords. At least a dozen by my count.Farms to west being used as some sort of horrible spawning glade for Scourge.Row upon row of victims.I think they're on to me. Made a dash for the hold. I won't be captured alive.Dreadvenom hemotoxin. If they decide to bite into me, they'll be in for a surprise.Take this information back to Barthus.11616Take this to Hellscream at once! In the meantime, I'm going to send a team to scout out the farms.Be sure to tell Hellscream that we're going to need reinforcements.11617I'm sure you've seen those blue and white platforms hovering over the quarry. They're the transportation the mage hunters used to land their forces here, and now they're loading them up with our artifacts and fragments of our statues.We must stop them before they leave the quarry.The small creatures digging in the quarry carry explosives. Take them and use them to destroy the three floating platforms. The leader keeps watch from a fourth, grounded platform, but we'll deal with him afterward.11618You may not have noticed that we're trying to win a war here, . I need all available soldiers at the primary points of conflict. This means that we don't have any real soldiers to spare for these minor incursions.If Barthus wants reinforcements at the farm......he shall have them! Report to Barthus's assassins at the farms, west of here. Let them know that reinforcements have arrived.11619My own father was slain by the leader of this raiding party, Gamel the Cruel.  He has made his abode inside a cave on the beach.You've dealt with his men already.  Finish what you've started, .  Avenge my father and I will share with you what little I still have.11620There is someone who might shed light on this mystery, .  It is rumored that the Kvaldir have kept a naga priestess alive at the temple on the west side of the shore.She will no doubt have great reason to resent her uninvited Kvaldir guests.  Perhaps my father is expecting her to cooperate with you in some way.11623The leader of the mage hunter forces is a fearsome creature called Curator Insivius. My people have hunted the beasts of the seas and land for countless generations, but I've never seen anything like this curator before.He's landed one of those flying disks on the upper rim of the quarry and oversees the operation from there. , I can only believe the ancestors themselves sent you to my rescue and I hope you will help me drive the mage hunters from this quarry once and for all.11624I must find out what happened to my master, Farseer Grimwalker!Earlier, he was observing the magnataur at nearby Magmoth. But one of his grunts just returned, saying that the group had been crushed, and that the farseer was dragged into the depths of the place.Before I send you on a suicide mission, I wish to consult with the spirits to learn more.There is an air elemental known as Imperean in the ruins of Eldra'nath to the west. She is wise and may give you the information we seek.11625Five hundred years ago, Azshara imprisoned a being named Leviroth in the waters below.  Now these barbarians seek to undo our queen's work!They took over our city and began to sacrifice my brethren to awaken him!  When they ran out of naga, they began to take tuskarr.  Their spirits will know no peace!I will help you, for it will go a long way towards quelling my vengeance.  Their captain, Ragnar, dwells deep inside northeastern Riplash.  He has in his possession a golden trident.  Bring it to me!11626Raj Naz'jan was the emperor of Riplash when Leviroth was imprisoned.  Azshara herself blessed his trident so it would slay the beast should it ever escape.Now you wield it, .  As much as it disgusts me, I will have my revenge on these barbaric giant-men.Take the trident to the depths beneath Riplash.  You will find Leviroth below an iceberg closest to northern Riplash.Drive the trident into his flesh and slay him!  Return to whomever sent you when you're done; I wish to see no more of you.11627Ah, it is information that you crave: the whereabouts and condition of your 'farseer'. He did not see so far as to avoid the trouble which befell him.Nevertheless, I will give you the means to acquire the knowledge. But first, you will do some things for me.No doubt you have seen the war between fire and water to the south. Simmer keeps boiling Churn's pool, and the two have been battling for ages.Go to the Charred Rise and Blistering Pool, and convince each of them to stop their bickering.11628To the northeast looms the Temple City of En'kilah, the Scourge's seat in Borean Tundra. From behind its walls, the Scourge commander has sent his Nerubians to surround us.Remaining on the defensive would doom my people, but my advisors differ in their strategies. Durm would charge in blindly, while Sage Aeire favors stealth.The Temple City has blighted the nearby lands and the native creatures. Aeire believes the pelts of the scourged mammoths can serve as a cloak that may hide an infiltrator.11629You have done what was asked, and now I give you that which you desire.Deliver this primal to the spirit talker back at your Bor'gorok Outpost. If she is wise, she will know a ritual to gain you the information which you seek.11630By curing the hides with the blighted earth outside the Temple City, Sage Aeire believes she can create a cloak which will cause most of the Scourge minions to ignore your presence. You should blend right in, she says.She'd best be correct. It's our only chance to gather information and plan our counterattack.You should be able to find the earth she needs poking in the areas to the south and west of the fortress. Bring it to me when you've finished gathering it.11631Here, , I've attuned the primal to you.Open your soul to it in the presence of my totem of air and concentrate upon the fate of Farseer Grimwalker.The spirit of the wind touches all; with any luck you will be granted a vision.11632You hold the carapace fragment of Ith'rix the Harvester and realize that this is only the beginning. Even now you sense that victory is fleeting. Surely the Lich King has a thousand more beasts like Ith'rix, waiting to be unleashed upon the Horde.Take your trophy and present it to High Overlord Saurfang, inside Warsong Hold. He should be notified of your victory over a powerful Scourge agent.11633Sage Aeire has finished the shroud. Take it with you and travel to the Temple City of En'kilah. Don the cloak within the city's bounds to hide yourself from most of the Scourge there. This will be our best opportunity to gather information about the enemy's fortifications and leaders.While wearing the cloak, scout the three large spires on the grounds of the city. While the shroud will shield you from most of the Scourge, the En'kilah abominations will be able to find you if you get too close.11634You're a tough mother, . I think your talents are better suited elsewhere - like the root of the whole damn problem!A thousand Scourge, at least four full sized floating death machines and who knows what else.But you're gonna find out and then you're gonna handle it... That's right, you're gonna beat the hell out of the Scourge army that's currently beating down our door.Get to the top of Warsong Hold and report to Wind Master To'bor. He'll be expecting you.11635You must go to Magmoth to the east.You must descend into the depths of their caverns.You must speak with Farseer Grimwalker's spirit!11636Tanks, mon. I be talkin' bout siege machines! We got heavy tanks stationed at Garrosh's Landing on da west coast. We gonna get you to da tank and you gonna use da tank to lay down some Horde justice on da Scourge!Da only tricky part be getting' you der. No way we be sendin' you on our wind riders. Too risky.You see dat pixie o'er der? Dat blondie elf? Yanni be his name, mon. He can get you to da coast, safely. Once der, talk to Gorge da Corpsegrinder!11637After my small force of grunts were killed, I was dragged down here and ritually murdered. The snobold who did this is known as Kaganishu.Though you have vanquished his shaman helpers, my spirit is still tethered to this place. After he slew me, he created a fetish from my body, which anchors me here. Kaganishu is using it to learn all that I know of shamanism.You must retrieve the fetish from him and use it upon my spirit. Kaganishu is nearby in the caves.Only then will I truly be free.11638, now that my spirit has been freed would you do me the honor of returning my remains to Spirit Talker Snarlfang? They lay upon the ground beneath me.I sense that the spirit talker is still at Bor'gorok Outpost to the west where last I saw her.11639The overlord refuses to allow the shaman to heal my wounds. He says that it will be a good lesson for me and give me time to reflect upon my failure.But you could get revenge for me and the others who fell at Magmoth!I know that the spirit talker wants you to go in there to save the farseer.It's just to the east. Go, ... go slay the magnataur and their snobold servants. Regain the outpost's honor!11640Within the spires you described dwell the main lieutenants of the Scourge leader, the high priests. Not only do they command the Scourge forces, but they hold the key to the necropolis above, and their master.An endless stream of Scourge minions will overrun us if we can't find and defeat their leader. I cannot leave my people defenseless, however much Durm might want to bring the fight to the enemy. It falls to you, , to slay the high priests and take the scrolls they hold.11641From the beginning, I've counseled that Chieftain Wintergale should assemble our mighty warriors and attack our enemy at their base. My advice has fallen on deaf ears and he has proven that he'd rather tip-toe around according to Sage Aeire's plans.I'll wait no longer. If Chieftain Wintergale is too cowardly to send our warriors into battle, perhaps you'd be willing to show him that a direct attack can succeed. Storm the Temple City of En'kilah and slay all in your path, .11642We need to get these tanks back up and runnin'! They ain't gonna fix themselves. Mobu's gonna be the one to handle that stuff. Talk to him and see what he needs. Maybe you can shut him up before he finally drives me into a berserker frenzy and I cleave his little gnome-sized frame in two!I hate gnomes...11643These wrenches are useless, buddy. I need my pneumatic tank transjigamarig to get these things up and running! Unfortunately, I left it at my old digs, on the other side of this landing. It's the beat down hut next to the stables. You're gonna have to go and get it for me, because I sure as hellfire am not going to go anywhere near the mist.Oh yea, buddy, watch out for the mist. The mist is what tore up these shores.11644I need metal to patch these tanks up! Super strong metal plates can be found scattered about all across Garrosh's Landing and at the bottom of the bay.Just be careful when you're out there searching for plates. The mist is... um... AGGRESSIVE! The mist is what took out the landing and the adjoining tuskarr town. Poor little tuskarr...11645Those dirty, stinkin' snobolds... they stole all of my supplies!What's a snobold you ask? It's like a kobold, 'cept they serve the magnataur; kinda take care of them. I know, weird!Anywho, wanna help me out? I know the little creeps stole off with all of my stuff. Stupid me thinkin' that it'd be nice and safe, packed up on the north side of the airstrip.Why don'tcha do me a favor and head north to their stupid Magmoth. There's a cash reward if you bring all my stuff back quick!11646Listen closely, , for there is not a moment to spare.Your prisoner is being prepared for interrogation here in our tower. In the event that he is less than forthcoming, your assistance may be required.Make your way up to where he is being detained and tell Librarian Normantis that I've sent you to assist him.11647The presence of plague cauldrons within the Temple City of En'kilah worries me greatly, . It's clear that Chieftain Wintergale trusts your judgment and your knowledge of our enemy. Would you help me deal with the cauldrons as you help the chieftain carry out his plans in the Temple City?I've prepared a totem which will attack and neutralize the contents of the cauldrons. All you must do is locate the cauldrons and use the totem near each. Each Scourge weapon we destroy brings us closer to victory.11648It is fortunate you're here, .You see, the Kirin Tor code of conduct frowns upon our taking certain 'extreme' measures - even in desperate times such as these.You, however, as an outsider, are not bound by such restrictions and could take any steps necessary in the retrieval of information.Do what you must. We need to know where Lady Evanor is being held at once!I'll just busy myself organizing these shelves here. Oh, and here, perhaps you'll find this old thing useful....11649Now that their little squabble is dealt with, there is still the matter of helping you and your spirit talker.As you can see, my vassals have been enraged by the ongoing war between fire and water. This will not change anytime soon, but it will serve to your advantage.In order to assist you, what we need are their motes. Head further into the ruins and retrieve them from the tempests.11650As you may have noticed, we created the airstrip on the southern border of a magnataur den!The old man has put me in charge of finding a... ahem... creative solution to this situation: if we don't deal with them soon, they'll come down here and tear us limb from limb!That's where you come in. I want you to get me everything on this shopping list. Please.11651Thanks for all your help, buddy. You can let Gorge know the tanks are ready for action. Hopefully you can clean up this place once and for all!11652Once you're ready, jump into one of the tanks and drive it out to the Plains of Nasam, southeast of here.Use the tank's weapon arsenal to take down the Scourge army. If you get in a jam, the \"Meatpounder\" will tear 'em up and the land mines will finish 'em off! If you find any of our soldiers, grab 'em! One last thing, fuel tanks can be found all over the field.Try to get close enough to that structure in the center and see what's going on.If you do all of this and live, go to Hellscream!11653That'll do her, chief! So, here's what I want ya to do....Take my blaster and head north to Magmoth. If we're gonna have a chance at all against those monsters, we need to cut them down to size... so to speak.In order to gauge its effectiveness, I need you to slay the magnataur while the blaster's effects are still on it. Any of the crushers or mates will do, but don't bother with the offspring... they're too small to worry about.11654As you inspect the captured blood vial, you realize its contents are still warm. The victim must have just been bled and may still be alive.What use would the Scourge have for blood? They've never shown an interest in live prisoners in the past. Perhaps if you can locate the source of the blood, you'll be able to discover what the Scourge is planning.11655Across the mist to the north you will find Garrosh's Landing. To the south are the ruins of my old home, Pal'ea. Both have been ransacked by an ancient force known as the Kvaldir.These fearsome savages slew all of my people without mercy and drove your people inland.All that remains of the tuskarr of Pal'ea are our personal effects, taken as relics by the Kvaldir. While we are not a vengeful race, justice must be served. The tuskarr relics must be returned to me. Enter the mist and find them...11656Tuskarr magic is similar to what your people call shamanism. While we serve the elements differently than you, the power that we are able to call forth is formidable.With this tuskarr torch I want you to return to the mist and strike at the Kvaldir vessels. You will find three of their vessels docked behind the mist at Garrosh's Landing, north of here, and one docked off the shores of Pal'ea, to the south. Burn their ships in effigy! For all to see!11657Now that you can throw a torch, let's see if you can catch one!Take this stack of unlit torches.  Go to the bonfire and throw a torch high into the air.  Catch it before it hits the ground... then throw it back up!  Catch four in a row, then come back to me.Careful! They're dangerous if they hit the ground!  And don't miss any catches!  If you do then you'll have to go back to the bonfire and start over.  Good luck!11658Okay, don't panic! The blaster might not've worked, but we still have options.We're going to divert attention away from the airstrip! To make this work, we'll need a few things first.Steeljaw's caravan, just to the west, stupidly took a shortcut through a taunka graveyard and was destroyed by their risen spirits.Head over there and get some outfits off of the dead orcs. Pick up one of their banners, too!11659They're... bleeding the prisoners... putting the blood... in those globes.The blood... taken up to necropolis... to feed blood prince...P-promise... you'll... destroy blood... globes... bring word... to Junek.11660A Kvaldir lieutenant known as Orabus directed the initial incursion against my people at Pal'ea, He oversaw the destruction of both villages and then disappeared into the mist.In those early days there was talk of a horn that Orabus gifted to the Kvaldir mistweavers. This horn could be used to summon him should the need arise.We need to get that horn from the Kvaldir mistweavers and call forth Orabus. If he is destroyed, these savages might retreat.Seek out mistweavers at Pal'ea, to the south.11661Take the horn and travel west to the Warsong Jetty. Make your way to the end of the jetty and blow into the horn. The sound should rouse Orabus.Slay the foul beast and return to me!11662A fellow survivor of Pal'ea known as Karuk has made his way to the main base of the Kvaldir in the Borean Tundra - far to the south where the snow was once bountiful. Karuk hides along the bluffs overlooking Riplash Strand.Seek out Karuk and let him know what you did for my people here at the Coast of Echoes.The safest route to Karuk is through your fortress. From Warsong Hold, take the road south and follow it around until you reach Riplash Strand.11663Thank you, ! The information you've extracted is of vital importance to the Kirin Tor.Return at once to Donathan as we make plans for the rescue of Lady Evanor.11664I can hear the mist creatures outside. Their yells are driving me mad, but I dare not try to escape. And where would I even go? How long would it be until they caught up with me and executed me like the others?I wonder, how far has the mist crept, stranger? Has it overtaken this whole continent?Would you be willing to help me try and escape the mist? I think I can lead us back toward my father. I still sense his life spirit. He is close.11665Hello .  I'm glad you've stopped by to talk to this old man--there's trouble back home.A traveling merchant recently sold a batch of baby crocolisks to some gullible children.  Crocolisks are wild beasts, and many have escaped and now lurk in city waterways.Grab your strongest fishing pole and drop a line in Stormwind or Orgrimmar and bring one of the little devils back to me.  I'm anxious to see one.11666You probably know all about the golden darter--they're fairly common in the rivers of Terokkar Forest and a delicacy for priests.  But here's one you haven't heard of: the blackfin darter.The fish is notoriously crafty and difficult to catch.  You have to pull your line at the last possible second, because they nibble at the bait before they take it.Drop your line in the rivers of Terokkar and bring me a blackfin darter.  Avoid the lakes, as the blackfin only thrive in moving water.11667Figluster's mudfish is a surprisingly quick bottom feeder found in the waters of Nagrand.  They grow their entire lives and are well known as fighters.Years ago, I caught what I'm certain was the world's biggest mudfish... until it snapped my line and escaped.A fisherman of your caliber doesn't need to be told what to do--your destiny awaits in the lakes of Nagrand.11668There's a lot of big fish in the Zangarmarsh lakes.  Ever wonder what they eat?Shrimp.  Giant freshwater shrimp.  The Rokk tells me the dishes you can make with shrimp are nearly endless.But shrimp are too small to catch with a fishing line.  So here's the trick: cut open the bloated barbed gill trout and you'll find a shrimp or two if you're lucky.11669This old man is going hunting soon.  I'm gonna take down a mammoth shark off the coast of Azshara.The thing is, I need a toxin that'll stay on a spear tip while it's underwater.  To make that kind of stuff, I need the glands from a poisonous fish: the felblood snapper.Such a vile fish only thrives in the waters of Hellfire Peninsula and Shadowmoon Valley.  Bring me back a whopper and I'll be a happy old man.11670With all of those outfits you, er, recovered, I fashioned a Warsong orc disguise. I had the genius idea of combining it with some old stuff that I had left hanging around from last Hallows' End, so it should be foolproof!Here, in this sack is the disguise and the banner you recovered. Head down into the bowels of Magmoth and slay the magnataur chieftain, Magmothregar.If you're going to convince them to turn their attention on the Warsong orcs, you'll need to plant the banner while disguised.11671So it's true. They have her.It's clear what must be done, . She WILL be saved.I must remain here and aid in the rescue preparations. I call upon you again; this time to collect the prison key. All we know of this Salrand figure is that she cannot be harmed so long as her shield is intact.We've customized a special explosive that should strip her of this protection, allowing you to perform your duty. Return to me when you've collected the key.Hurry, . Lady Evanor is suffering!11672You've come to enlist, right?  Normally you'd have to stand in line like the other recruits.  Normally you'd be out of luck because the recruitment ledger's gone missing and I can't process anyone until the new books get here.Fortunately for you, , I've heard about you and what you did in Outland.  To be honest, you're a cut above these poor saps.  Lines aren't for you.Go to the barracks and speak to General Arlos.  He'll be more than happy to meet with someone of your caliber.11673I knew they'd send someone for me sooner or later... turned out to be later, of course.I came in here to parlay with the snobolds, but their main shaman, Kaganishu, decided instead that I'd make a tasty snack for Magmothregar.Wait... what?! They didn't send you?!DID THEY FORGET ABOUT ME?!Okay, you're here now and that's all that matters.As soon as you break this chain we'll make our way back to the airstrip. Then you can tell Fizzcrank I'm safely back.If he remembers me, that is.11674There are many new mysteries walking the lands now. One of our sages, Highmesa, has foolishly gone north with only one longrunner to investigate something strange near the Dens of Dying.What are the dens, you ask? They are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die. She saw something fall from the sky near them a few days ago.If you would be friend to the taunka, I would have you find and help her. She is not so stubborn that she will not accept your aid.11675The magnataur at the Dens of Dying have contracted a plague. We must find the cause, but first we must put them out of their misery., you must go north onto the slopes in front of us and destroy as many of the poor creatures as you can.11676The soldiers that they didn't kill are being held in cages scattered across this farmland. Through some thievery we've managed to find a few keys, but we're unable to get close enough to any prisoners without being attacked.We need your \"talents\" in securing those keys and freeing the prisoners. Bash in the brains of the necrolords and aberrations and take their keys. Use those keys to free Scourge prisoners.11677I'm convinced that the plague is being caused by something in the caves up there., I want you to take these seeds. I normally use them as a ward against the Scourge, though perhaps they can be used to disrupt whatever foulness is happening in the dens.Find the source of the plague and throw them into it.11678Bristlehorn should have returned by now.The other reason why we came up here was to investigate that Scourge structure to the west, which fell from the sky. He's impetuous and has likely gotten himself into trouble., go to that place and find him, please.11679Delays, delays... the one thing we cannot afford right now!As much as I hate to disturb Lord Surristrasz, he's our only hope of saving our beloved Evanor.Bring him the key fragments and hope that his mood is favorable.Hurry, , our assault team is waiting.11680The key is forged anew.Now heed my counsel, . Succeed in your endeavor or die trying, for if a single scale falls from one of my drakes I shall hold you personally accountable.Now, off with you.11681At last, we attack!Once we've cleared the platform I'll use the key.You are to ensure that Lady Evanor remains safe after her release.Hurry now, let us be off!11682I am aware of your recent deeds here, , and again I thank you.As for this local menace, we've learned all we need to know from them. They'll be dealt with in short order. On now to more important issues....Azeroth needs you. The region just west of here is the center of an urgent crisis.I'll leave the details to Lord Surristrasz. You must speak with him at once.Good luck, friend of Dalaran.11683The fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge.While you are at Talramas, , I would ask that you dispatch all of the Lich King's servants that you find within and in the surrounding pools where it fell.11684Can you feel the tremors in the earth?The Scourge's nerubians are on the move deep beneath the ground. They've emerged to the southwest in the Geyser Fields, and are harassing the patrols Chieftain Wintergale sent out.Perhaps a single person can succeed where the patrols have failed. Take this with you to the Geyser Fields and map out the locations of the Nerubian sinkholes.11685Now that we know the exact locations of the nerubian sinkholes, we can collapse them to halt the Scourge offensive and cripple their force. Wind Tamer Barah knows a way to harness elementals to destroy the tunnels the Nerubians are using, but she will require your help.Southeast of the village, near the coast beyond the Frozen Reach, you'll find an area dominated by frozen earth elementals. The hearts of these elements are exactly what Wind Tamer Barah will need.11686According to Luther's notes the Scourge is now using this place as a breeding ground for those monsters you see lumbering across the field.Those monsters were once orcs... tauren...We need more information before a plan can be devised. I want you to investigate three sites that are heavily trafficked by Scourge: the Warsong Granary, southwest of us, Torp's Farm, directly west of us, and the old Warsong Slaughterhouse, north of us.Return to me once you've scouted 'em out.11687There are two... that must... be killed.The doctor and... the lich-lord... are above. Find them... destroy them... before.......it is too... late....11688Just look at 'em! My beautiful kodos are helpless to defend themselves against those filthy swine! I need you to buy me some time, . I think I can cure the kodo of the sickness, but you need to keep the unliving swine off 'em, else there'll be nothin' left to cure!Get out there and send those swine to their graves - permanently!11689The greatmother will need to know, .Will you please return to Taunka'le? Tell her that I will be following shortly.11690Take this riding snaffle, . You'll notice that I've placed a tiny medicine dispenser in the mouthpiece. That thing will cure the infection as soon as a kodo bites down. Once you've cured the sick out of 'em, you'll need to ride 'em home. They'll be weak so you'll need to gently direct 'em here.Bring my babies back, !One last thing, you've got ten minutes! That's how long the antidote will remain effective inside that snaffle.11691I and my Shamans have gathered our powers for the coming battle with the Lord of Frost.  , you will be the fist of the Earthmother.Take this magma totem.  Use it against the Ice Stone, to the northeast.  Ahune is channeling his power through this stone; it is our hope that the totem will disrupt him and cut off his link to the elemental planes.If fortune is with us, then, perhaps, we can defeat him.Prepare yourself, .  If Ahune comes to face us, then his fury will be great.11692You're a proven . I have another problem!My boss, Tinky, went east with Bixie Wrenchshanker and I CAN'T get the outgoing on this thing to work! Tinky's the only one that can fix it and we really need it working one-hundred percent.You think you could find them? Bixie said something about following some old magnataur to a place called The Dens of Dying.I'm guessing that's where you'll find them.You can catch a ride out there by talking with Kara Thricestar at the runway.11693Tinky and I came out here stalking some old magnataur. Apparently those caves up there are where they go to die.Of course, we had no idea that they were going to get plagued when they went in there. We can't have plagued things just roaming about; it's not healthy.Say, why don't you put down a number of those things while I figure out what our next step should be?11694So, while you were out taking care of those plagued beasts, I took a peek inside the caves up there.There are cultists in there plaguing them!They have some sort of noxious concoction brewing in a cauldron. I have a powder that I normally use as an anti-poison, and I mixed it up with some other stuff. I think it'll neutralize their brew!Take it up to one of those caves and see if it works.11695I can fashion the likeness of an elemental from these pieces of inanimate stone, but breathing life into it is different. For that, we'll need help and a bit of luck.Legend tells of an ancient artifact called the Horn of Elemental Fury, sought after by a great hero. I'll lend you a scroll with a copy of the tale. I don't know if the legend is true, but it's our best bet. If the legend is right, the parts of the horn may be in the Flood Plains surrounding the village to the north and southwest.11696, your presence is a blessing.  Ahune lies within these caverns, gathering strength for his assault.  Earthen Ring forces were sent ahead, but they alone cannot defeat him.Explore, .  Find our Earthen Ring Shamans and speak with their leader, Luma Skymother.  Perhaps, with your added strength, we can beat Ahune before it's too late.11697I told Tinky not to go off on her own, but she just HAD to check out that crashed necropolis to the west.I'm 100% certain that those cultists came from inside that thing, which means I'm now 100% certain that Tinky's in trouble!She's the airstrip's number one engineer. Without her we're doomed!I'd find her myself, but one of those things got in a swipe on my leg before I could vanish again. , if anyone can get her out, it's you!11698If the cultists up in those caves survived the crash, then that fallen necropolis to the west can only be assumed to still be filled with Scourge. There're probably lots of them out in front of it in the pools, too!While you're at Talramas, , do you think you could dispatch all of the Lich King's flunkies that you find there?11699The cultists magicked me into this cage and there's no door to it. Little did they know that I'm the chief transmatter engineer for the airstrip!With your help, and a little elbow-grease, I won't be in here for long.I'm going to need an engine-core crystal from one of the ghouls in here, a magical gyroscope from their doctor, and a piloting scourgestone from the lich-lord up top.With all of that stuff, I should be able to make a port device to get back to Fizzcrank's and escape the gnome way!11700My evil twin's out there somewhere now.I'm pretty sure that she's not back at the airstrip. In fact, wherever she ended up, it's colder there than here. But I could only 'feel' her for a moment.Oh well, I'll reconfigure this thing and port myself back to the airstrip soon enough. In the meantime, do you think you could go east and let Bixie know that I'll meet her back there?Thanks, !11701Okay, I think I'm going to start making my way back to the airstrip, too. Of course, I'm moving a little slower with this leg injury.Say, do you think you could get there ahead of me and pass on the good news to Ol' Fizzcrank? I bet anything that there'll be a reward in it for you.Thanks, !11702Dis is gonna sound weird, , but dere be a murloc askin' for our help!He goes by da name of King Mrgl-Mrgl, leader of da Winterfin murlocs. Him and his people been run outa dere village and wantin' you to come save dem.You find him by headin' west and go down da cliffs. He hangin' out on da south side of da Winterfin Retreat.11703The Scourge agent that's overseeing the abduction and transformation of Horde soldiers into undead monsters is using the northwest farm as a spawning glade. Shadowstalker Getry has been staking out that monster for the past week and has gathered some vital information that might allow us to end this menace.Get to Getry and see if you can help him put a stop to this Scourge assembly line. You'll find Getry at the abandoned tower on the northwest border of these farms.11704This is the weirdest thing, , but there's a murloc asking for our help!He goes by the name of King Mrgl-Mrgl, leader of the Winterfin murlocs. It would seem that he and his people have been run out of their village and they want someone to come save them.That someone is you!You'll find Winterfin Retreat, and the king, by heading west down the road until you come to the cliffs. Head down to the water line near the Blistering Pool.11705This is madness. How do they expect us to take on a Scourge necrolord and an unknown number of his minions?If Ickoris sent you he must think that you are capable of great feats. Perhaps you will call down a miracle today, eh?When you're ready we will descend and face Varidus.If we make it out of this mess in one piece, report back to Hellscream in Warsong Hold.11706I have created and bound Alluvius using the Horn of Elemental Fury. He will respond to the horn's call when you stand near the southernmost sinkhole in the Geyser Fields.The quake Alluvius will unleash should collapse the Nerubian tunnels and put an end to their flanking attack. I wouldn't be surprised if the Nerubian commander showed himself after the quake. If the collapse of the tunnels doesn't break the back of their assault, the defeat of their leader surely will.11707Oh good, you're , right?We need your help up north at Fizzcrank Airstrip, like yesterday! The magnataur, and the Scourge... and the pumping station!It's madness I tell you, madness!You've got to head up there and talk to old man Fullthrottle a.s.a.p.!11708Now that you're here, it's time for me to tell you the full story of what's going on.After you've heard my tale, go outside and find my second-in-command, Jinky Wingnut. She'll handle everything from here on out.11709While you have done much to secure our foothold in these frozen wastes, other dangers still lurk in the shadows. I want you to assist Warden Nork Bloodfrenzy, stationed at the internment camp just outside and immediately southeast of Warsong Hold. Seek him out and offer your assistance for prisoner transport and exchange.You are dismissed, .11710There're spare parts strewn all over to the east in the Scalding Pools, the Geyser Fields... heck, probably even up on the pumping station still, too. Bring back a whole bunch. Maybe then I'll be able to get outgoing teleport on this thing working, not to mention getting the incoming transmatter ports aligned.I'd hate to see another accident....11711We're seeing more deserters show up at our gates with each passing day. We simply do not have enough room to keep all of these maggots caged up. Especially not if we want to keep the pigs happy.I want you to escort one of these cowards to the crossroads east of here and fire this flare gun. One of their captains will show up when they see the flare and take the coward off your hands.Report to Scout Tungok on the east road once the delivery has been made.11712If you listened to the old man, then you know that we have gnomes out there that were changed. Gearmaster Mechazod infected them with something that reversed the \"Curse of the Flesh\", and now they're robots!We think we have a way to re-curse them back to normal. We want you to take this re-cursive transmatter injection and use it on the corpses of any mechagnomes you come across.We're hoping that this stuff will cure them and allow us to lock onto them to port 'em out of there.Whaddya say, ?11713Fizzcrank sent out an aerial surveillance team to map the Nerubian sinkholes in the southern part of the Geyser Fields, but they haven't yet returned. I can't afford to wait any longer for their information, so I'm going to need someone to check out the sinkholes on foot.I understand the dangers involved, and I'll compensate you accordingly. Take this map with you and record the vital information about each of the sinkholes you encounter out there.11714Perhaps you'd be interested in helping me clean up these fields? They're littered with dirty little rat men! Kobolds, snobolds, whatever you wanna call 'em, they're all over the damned place. The stink alone is making my life hell!Take care of the vermin for me and I'll make it worth your while, .11715I plan to build a machine that will collapse the tunnels the Scourge is using to deploy their Nerubians, but with the main drilling rig out of order, we'll have to collect the fuel for the device some other way.Out in the Geyser Fields to the southeast, small pools of oil bubble up away from the main rig. If you can collect enough of the oil from those pools, I can make a crude fuel to power the machine.Simply deploy the collector near the rig, and it will pump and store the oil in its tank.11716We are witnessing something amazing here, . A whole undiscovered ecology lives and breathes not more than a few paces from us! I surmise it is the bloodspore plant that sets this environment abuzz.I have collected some pollen from the nearby male species of bloodspore plant but still lack female receptors for pollination. Fetch me a bushel of the bloodspore carpels. You'll find them near the larger plants surrounding us.Be wary of their guardians! The kobolds won't give them up easily!11717It's obvious! The bloodspore moths are the entities responsible for pollination on these plains. It must be something that happens within the moth's internal system that acts as a catalyst for this pollen to work. It's all starting to make sense now, . That's why the kobolds don't kill the moths and instead go to great lengths to protect them! Those stupid little rats have it all figured out!Well we'll just have to get our own moth pollen! What do you say? Fetch me some in the name of science?11718I've reconfigured the skeleton of an old bot to create an earthquake large enough to collapse the tunnels, but the machinery is delicate and sensitive to Northrend's biting cold.I've devised a means of insulating it using the thickest hides of the native mammoths. They roam the plains south of the airstrip and adjacent to the Geyser Fields. Bring back enough of the hides for me to finish the machine and then we'll be able to unleash it on the Nerubians!11719So we've got this pollinated bloodspore flower and nobody to test its effects on. Say, would you perhaps be interested in rubbing this on your skin and letting me observe? What's the worst that could happen anyway?Don't you worry, ! Just take this sample and rub it all over your face.11720Hellscream assigned Mighthorn and I with the daunting task of magnataur extermination on the southern front of Warsong Hold. With us came an entire platoon of seasoned Horde soldiers. Our initial foray into the nearby magnataur dens proved quite unsuccessful as our entire squad was wiped out by the lair defenders. We're the only ones left...We aren't scientists or researchers. We're soldiers of the Horde, just like you. Soldiers on a mission that cannot fail...Speak to Primal Mighthorn now.11721Magnataur live in prides, much like lions: one or two dominant males and several females along with their offspring. In the case of Gammoth, the magnataur den west of here, Gammothra is the leader. It is Gammothra that controls this magnataur population and therefore it is Gammothra that must be slain to prevent any type of magnataur uprising.Take this pouch of crushed bloodspore flower to Gammoth. Use the powder from the pouch to weaken Gammothra and then slay him! Return his head to me as proof.11722We cannot take all of the credit for this Horde victory, . It was you who risked your life to test the bloodspore and it was you who ultimately put an end to Gammothra.Honor us by returning to Warsong Hold and presenting the head of Gammothra to Lord Hellscream.11723Behold, the machine that will save us from the Nerubian threat!Take this remote control with you, and go out to the southernmost of the Nerubian sinkholes in the Geyser Fields. Use the remote to activate the Shake-n-Quake 5000. It will do the rest on its own.Don't be surprised if the quake it creates attracts the attention of a Nerubian leader. In fact, it would be a great opportunity to finish off the Nerubian offensive.11724This egg was obviously important to somebody, as the corpse nearby can attest. As you look the egg over you notice that it has already been tagged for shipment to the Bloodspore Plains, care of Bloodmage Laurith. That's just east of here!Collect the egg and take it to the expectant Bloodmage.11725I should've flown the mission myself. It's not that I don't trust Tailspin. Far from it. Heck, he was the best wingman I ever flew with.No, it's just that it's my responsibility to lead a mission of such import.I sent Tailspin out with our fastest recon squadron to gather information about the Nerubian infestation in the middle of the Geyser Fields.The last report we received placed his squadron in the pools to the far south and just west of the Nerubian sinkholes.Find Tailspin, .11726The wolves have been pawing through the wreckage ever since the crash and I'm afraid they consumed the microfilm from our mission in the process.I have a plan to recover that microfilm, but I need your help to make it work.To the south and east, in the Flood Plains, live creatures called gorlocs. They prepare their foods with noxious spices, which would sicken any other creature. If you can gather enough of the spice pouches from gorloc steam belchers or gorloc waddlers, I can make the wolf bait.11727It's good to have you among us, .  We've all heard of your past deeds.As you know, King Wrynn is moving great armies into Northrend to meet those of Arthas.  But armies are nothing without true heroes to inspire and lead them.I want you to be that hero for my men.  Fight alongside them against the Scourge that lays siege to our stronghold.Report to Sergeant Hammerhill outside the inner hold.  Valiance Keep cannot fall.  The future of our campaign depends on it.11728Whatever you do, don't eat this bait yourself. Just set it down in the vicinity of an oil-soaked wolf. If they're desperate enough to eat the microfilm, they'll come running when they smell the bait.Simply wait for nature to take its course and then all you need to do is search the, uh... byproduct for the film.I'd offer you my special lupus pupus scupus for the job, but I left it back at the airstrip. I'm afraid you'll have to conduct the... err... search the old-fashioned way.11729The unit you just dismantled had this inside of its mechanical innards.It looks pretty complicated... certainly someone back at the airstrip would want to take a look at it. Maybe Crafty Wobblesprocket?11730The Ultrasonic Screwdriver is the ultimate tool. It can do anything to mechanical stuff!Head back into the pools and dismantle a number of Mechazod's robots. Then all you have to do is use the screwdriver on their remains, and I'm betting that they'll turn to our side, for a short time anyway.I'm pretty sure it won't work on the mechagnomes, so don't even bother with them.Oh, and if you want to take anything from the robot's insides, you'll want to do so before using the screwdriver!11731So you want to be a fire juggler?  Do you have what it takes?  The dexterity?  The reflexes?  ...the courage?  If you think so, then let's give you a little practice!Take these torches and run near the bonfire.  You'll see  braziers with markers flashing above them.  Toss a torch at a marked brazier.  Be quick! Do it before the mark fades if you want credit for the toss!Hit enough marked braziers before the time limit, then come back here... for your next lesson.1173211733I've been mindful of your efforts, mortal. Do not feign surprise. Surely you've felt my eye upon you.The time has come to peel back a layer of darkness from your mind.

You can't miss the places, they all have spinning lights.11789You there!  Please, I need your help.  This soldier will succumb to the cryptfiends' venom unless we act immediately.I've managed to slow down the poison, but without a suitable supply of antidote I cannot counteract it.I was promised a new shipment of anti-venom in the Stormbreaker's most recent trip from the south.  Go inside its hold and search for a chest of first aid supplies.Hurry, !  We can't afford to lose any more men unnecessarily.11790This altar bears all the markings of the Cult of the Damned.  It appears fanatics from the mainland have made it into Northrend.  It might be prudent to notify the captain of the ship.Perhaps he is to be found above deck.11791We must notify General Arlos at once.  I've known the captain for a long time and, believe me, he is one of the more careful ones.Who knows how many cultists have been smuggled into our settlements in Northrend in other ships?  This could be disastrous.11792Not so fast there.  I don't know about you, , but I was hardly convinced by the general's words.  They rung unsure... as if they were not his own.Something's amiss here.  All of our efforts to collaborate have been blocked and delayed.  It is time we took a more independent approach.If we're to learn more about the cultists inside the keep... perhaps we should investigate those outside.Intelligence reports a small group of them aiding the Scourge north of here.  See if they carry any clues.11793I'm afraid this is a matter I must delegate to one of my operatives... someone who can work in secret.  Keep the evidence with you and take it to Vindicator Yaala inside the inn.Tell her I sent you and speak of this matter to no one else.  We do not know who might be working for the cult.11794I've made it my business to learn as much as possible about the vile death cult, including their secret language.Vurenn was right.  The cultists mention disguised operatives in various locations in Valiance Keep: the lower docks, the jail inside the inner hold and in the inn's kitchen.Take this oculus.  Use it at those three locations - anyone that has recently used the cult's necromancy will be enshrouded by a dark aura.  Take care of the cultists before something nefarious happens.11795Injured or not, as squadron commander, I'm responsible for locating and returning the insignia of all fallen pilots under my command. In all the years I've flown with Fizzcrank, we've never failed to return the signet of a pilot.My injuries make it dangerous for me to stray far from the safety of the wreckage, but perhaps you would be willing to help me recover the insignia? In the meantime, I'll make preparations to carry out my final duty as squadron commander.11796There's only one more thing left to do before I can finally return to the airstrip and make my report. Section 8.2, paragraph D of the emergency protocol requires me to scuttle as much of the wreckage as possible, in order to prevent our technology from falling into enemy hands.I'll give you my torch if you agree to help me complete this last duty. I don't want to think about what the Horde's goblin allies will do if these machines fall into their hands.11797Well, well, well.  It's good to see Arlos bring out the big guns.Don't get me wrong - our lads are doing the best they can, but someone of your renown fighting alongside them could really turn the tides for us.  I'm not sure how much longer we can hold out against these undead Nerubians.What do you say you get out there and kill me some creepers?  Show these boys how it's done.11798Gearmaster Mechazod is insane!

Then Nesingwary showed up and everything changed. Now the caribou are in a perpetual state of frenzy, always in a panic. They are stalked by the hunters and trappers hidden in the field.Nesingwary's executioners are unfit for death.

She is a savage like no other, making a mockery out of the carcasses of the slain animals: drinking from their blood and howling to the moons!Find this murderer, Karen, and end her worthless existence.Prepare yourself properly, . Karen the Culler has indulged in the riches that Nesingwary has lavished upon her!11869To the west of us you will find Lake Kum'uya. It is, as far as we know, the only freshwater giant clam habitat in the world.Of course Nesingwary's lackeys are now using the lake as a giant pearl farm. They must be stopped! A lesson must be taught to those that would think to endanger an entire species.Go to Lake Kum'uya and locate the loot crazed divers. Slay them until the water runs red! Return to me when a proper example has been made!11870We have just gotten word from Liandra that mercenaries hired by Nesingwary are moving goods off the beach and onto the main Nesingwary shipping vessel. No doubt they plan on making a fortune from their murderous trade!She has asked that we send assistance to the Abandoned Reach, directly south of here on the beachfront of the Borean Tundra.Make haste, Liandra awaits you there!11871Strewn across this beach, amidst the flotsam and jetsam, are crates and sacks of animal parts. It would seem that Nesingwary is in cahoots with the Northsea Freebooters. Those dirty pirates are transporting the goods that Nesingwary's murderous lackeys gather offshore. No doubt they will end up in the homes and on the backs of wealthy, unscrupulous individuals across Azeroth.This won't happen. Not on our watch. Bring me all shipments that you find upon this beach. They'll never have them!11872It's despicable, really, to anoint one's self as the \"Clam Master,\" as if they hold mastery over the creatures of the sea. None may make such claims!This \"Clam Master\" must be found and slain. He was last seen at the wreckage just off the coast of the Abandoned Reach. Find him and kill him.Once this is done, return to Hierophant Cenius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment, north of here, and let her know that the mission was a success.11873Would you be willing to head back to the airstrip and let Fizzcrank know that I'll be along shortly to give my formal report? I've got to deal with the wreckage of my flying machine, and then I'll be on my way.I'll be certain that Fizzcrank knows that he has you to thank for my survival and the recovery effort.I only wonder what the old man would've done himself if he'd been flying with us. I miss those days.11875The troops of the Shattered Sun Offensive will need every advantage they can get to beat back the allies of Kil'Jaeden. My colleagues in Stormwind have created oils which will strengthen the blades and armor of our troops.The key ingredient, nether residue, pervades Outland  -- if you know where to look. Any master herbalist, skinner, or miner who knows the signs can gather it while plying  trade. Those herbs, ores, and beasts native to Outland may all bear the residue.11876They're majestic beasts, aren't they?With each passing day their numbers diminish. Demons that call themselves hunters slay the beasts for sport and riches.It's the whimpers that drive me to madness, . You can hear them, carried by the wind. The mammoth calves, trapped in the hunters' vile traps, call out to us.Take this hammer and smash those traps. Free the calves!11877As we press the offensive on Quel'Danas, we've discovered that Kael'thas' minions are planning a counterattack. By ordering the Sunfury blood elves, based in Netherstorm, to attack our operations in Outland, he hopes to draw troops and attention away from the Sunwell.We must not allow this to happen, . Each and every blade is needed on the front lines.Go to Netherstorm and capture their attack plans. Any of the Sunfury blood elves up there could be in possession of the plans. Good luck, .11878Although you have acted valiantly in freeing the trapped calves, many of them will still die. You see, without a caretaker, these calves must fend for themselves in the wild.But there is a way! Hope yet remains!North of here in the mammoth fields, bordering the Scalding Pools, you will find Khu'nok the Behemoth: a mammoth as wise as he is ancient. Take this mammoth orphan and present it to Khu'nok. He will know what to do.11879You cannot defeat the being responsible for the slaughter of my kind by yourself. The mammoths of the tundra will help you!Venture forth to the plains and find a mammoth bull. He will allow you to mount him and control his movements and actions. Ride upon his back and find Kaw, north of here at Kaw's Roost. Together, you will be the instrument of Kaw's demise.Destroy Kaw's armies and take from Kaw his coveted war halberd. Return to Lathorius at the D.E.H.T.A. Encampment should you succeed.11880I'm sure that 'gnomish inventor' is a crackpot. He was babbling about some dark distortions that have begun to appear in the Spirit Fields around Oshu'gun in Nagrand.According to him, these, uh, multiphase... um, spectro-goggles will allow the wearer to see the distortions and take readings from them. He insisted that recording this data was fundamental to our campaign at the Sunwell. I think he's nuts, but I'm under orders to investigate anything that might help. Would you mind taking some readings?11881Have you seen the flying machines buzzing around? That's gnomish innovation at its finest.I've long waited to get my hands on some of their technology and a perfect opportunity has presented itself. One of their recon wings crashed in the Scalding Pools, in the southwest part of the Geyser Fields.Blow this whistle near one of the crashed machines and my trusty mule, Jenny will answer. She'll follow you and carry the salvage, but you must keep her safe. She'll begin to drop the cargo if attacked.11882Are you interested in learning some hot new skills?I don't know if you'll ever be able to match my own considerable skill, but you can probably pick up a trick or two if you're an attentive student. Speak to a Master Fire Eater at any Alliance capital. They should be able to help you.11884West of here, on the high bluffs above Lake Kum'uya, roams a despicable being known as Nedar. The self proclaimed \"Lord of Rhinos\" hunts the wastes for the injured or young - rhinos unable to defend themselves against his cowardly attacks. To add insult to injury, Nedar has raised a rhino of his own to become his mount and bodyguard.It is a rare thing that D.E.H.T.A. would ever call for the death of an animal, but Nedar's tainted rhino must be disposed of... Kill them both and return to me.11885The descendants held prisoner by the Skettis talonpriests are listed in this book: Gezzarak the Huntress, Karrog the crystal giant, the heretic known as Darkscreecher Akkarai and Vakkiz the Windrager.  They will all need to be slain before Terokk returns to this world.You will need the scrolls carried by the time-lost arakkoa to call them forth at the summoning circles in Skettis.  These are powerful beings you will be facing; you would do well to bring friends.11886While celebration has its place, , some of us must look to graver matters.When the festival began, we received reports from Zoram Strand about a sharp increase in Twilight Cult activity. The origins of this holiday are steeped in the very powers those madmen revere; this cannot be coincidence. Go to the camp just south of the Blackfathom Deeps entrance, in the ruins, and see if the cultists will part with information - forcefully if need be. Use this beacon to summon a guide when you find it.11887Rifling through the dead gnome's possessions, you come across a small packet filled with rations, tools, and a handy roll of gnomish duct tape. The contents of these kits might prove helpful to Fezzix Geartwist when it comes time for him to reassemble the wreckage of the gnomish flying machines.Bringing a few of these kits to Fezzix might just be worth a nice bonus.11888, the chieftain is making me wait... time that Taunka'le does not have!There has been talk of your prowess. Rather than wait for Garrosh to send help, I ask you to go and help my people.Taunka'le village lies far to the northeast. Follow the road east out of the hold, turning north at the intersection. Not long after, you will come to another intersection. Follow the path east, passing south and then east of the great pools along the flood plains.Speak with Sage Earth and Sky when you arrive.11889We're doing a good job of holding the front lines against these bugs.  Some of these cheeky fiends, however, can fly over the aforementioned front lines and are really beating down on our inner defenses.I've requisitioned reinforced fishing nets from our civilian ships.  If you've got a good enough throwing arm, they'll help you knock the enemy out of the sky.  Thin their numbers so that our defenses can hold the keep.11890The gnomes have run into some trouble in the pools to the west. It serves them right as they have been fouling up the land with their so-called inventions.I want you to go out to their pumping station and observe what has befallen them. Return to me after.11891According to this, it seems there is another encampment of the cultists to the northwest of the large gathering on the Zoram Strand, and they are speaking with... guests?Much could be learned from listening to these proceedings, . Take this orb; it will allow you to appear as one of the native crawlers on the beach. Spy on the conversation with these \"guests\" of the cultists at the northwestern camp and report back to me when you are successful.11892You have done much for the animals of the Borean Tundra, . Nesingwary's lackeys have been beaten back and taught a lesson that they will not soon forget.Harold Lane, the primary agent responsible for the mass slaughters in Nagrand, has been identified as the man in charge of Nesingwary operations in the tundra. He is stationed at Lake Kum'uya, west of here.Find Lane and kill him. Use this horn should you require our aid.11893I kept trying to tell that silly goblin his machines are unreliable.But the power of the elements; that is deep and abiding. When my apprenticeship is over, I will wield their full power. What I know now should be sufficient to help out our friend Fezzix, though.Take this windsoul totem and plant it near any of the steam ragers to the west of the village. The totem will gather up the energies of slain elementals. Return the fully charged totem to me and I'll do the rest.11894Remember all that gnomish duct tape you brought me?Well, I've found a use for it. The body of this flying machine is so banged up in places, that I'm going to need to reinforce it if I ever hope to fly.Dorain over there has been telling me that the taunka use steam cured caribou leather for making watertight containers. Marsh caribou live all around the village and in the Flood Plains to the south. Get the best hides you can find and cure them over the steam vents in the Geyser Fields.11895From what you describe, the creatures of metal should be easy to deal with. But first, you must master the storm.Behind me in the lodge is a totem. When you are ready, focus your will upon it and the storm will come. You must defeat the storm and in so doing take its essence into yourself.If others are there, it is enough that you all work together to defeat it. Return to me after, .11896You now have the power of the storm within you. I will give you the means to focus that power and weaken the robots in the pools.Take this lightning rod. Use it against the robotic creations of the mechagnomes you find within the greater pools area to the west. Do not worry about using it against the mechagnomes themselves; Greatmother Taiga has other plans for them.Once the robots are weakened by the power of the storm, dismantle them utterly!11897The Scourge are showing no sign of letting up, .  It's those blasted sinkholes; they connect to tunnels all the way to Icecrown for all we know.  Giant undead worms burrow under the ground to create them.If there's something years of mining has taught me it's that without support beams, tunnels will cave in easily after an explosion.Take these explosives and place them at the entrance to the sinkholes up on the ridge beyond the beach to the west.  Come back after you've collapsed them.11898On the lowest tier of the Temple City, there is a gray altar bathed in light. Step into it to gain entry to the dread necropolis Naxxanar.Be cautious, . Prince Valanar will certainly be defended by his personal retainers, who will give their lives to keep you from ascending to the top level of the necropolis.You must find your way through the necropolis to the prince's seat. If you fail to defeat him, , I fear my people will never know the safety Icemist offers.11899The mechagnomes in the pools to the west are a great mystery to us. They appeared not long after the gnomes disappeared from their pumping station and its environs.They are an unnatural danger and must be dealt with.Take this soulcatcher and use it on the remains of the mechagnomes to capture their souls. When you return, we will set them free so that we might find out what happened.11900I had hoped that the Nexus' impact was limited to this region. Recently though, reports have flooded in from all over Azeroth suggesting that geologic instability is growing exponentially!I need the Nexus monitored regularly as I work to develop a solution.I've placed sensitive instruments around Coldarra, disguised as Malygos' scrying orbs. One lies in the trench near the Nexus, and three are hidden in the structures around the valley's perimeter. Visit each and return to me with their readings.11901There's Scourge everywhere, .  We've organized the farmers and miners into a militia, but this just won't cut it.The one detachment of troops that Valiance Keep sent is defending the mine.  We haven't heard from them in days!If you really wish to help us, why don't you go to the mine and see what's going on?  Maybe we can get them to send us some reinforcements.11902The sacks of grain emanate the foul stench you've come to associate with the Plague.  This probably explains what happened to the footmen defending the mine.You'd best bring word back to Gerald Green.11903Well, .  With the last of our military in Farshire dead or worse, we can do but one thing: fight these Scourge ourselves.We have deployed militia in what remains of Farshire.  Without your help, they've but little hope of winning.  Go and lend them a hand.  Me and the lads will watch this path.  We can't let the Scourge break through!11904The Scourge just keeps coming... but we can't give up!  Listen, .  Inside that mine there's a cart with the last of the ore the Alliance is going to see on this side of the continent for a long time.The problem is the cart release is locked.  When the military went in there, Captain Jacobs commandeered all the important equipment, including the cart release key.The plague that affected the soldiers in the mine must also have affected Jacobs.  Get the key from him and salvage the ore.11905Azeroth's ley lines are being redirected to the Nexus.The influx of arcane energies is tearing a rift between dimensions.I cannot stop it, but I've discovered a way to slow it down.Take this and activate it near the forming rift.11906I have heard that you are heading back into the pools to the west. I have something for you to do while you are out there, .The gnomes, who care nothing for the land, have polluted it with their machinery. I want you to pick up any spare parts that you come across.Return them to me here. I will see to it that they are properly disposed of before we leave this place for good.11907It is known that Gearmaster Mechazod has four sub-chieftains that manage the robots in the pools.We must put an end to them!Our longrunners and snow trackers say that if you were to turn the valves at the west point, north point, mid point and south point stations, each of his sub-chieftains would come quickly to prevent you from fouling their operations.The stations are centered on the spinning lights in the pools surrounding the pumping station.Hurry, !11908I was in charge of the harvest golems - an important job until the Scourge destroyed most of our farmlands.  I've an idea that would make the golems useful again, however.I think I can rewire the harvest collectors so they'll give us a hand fighting the Scourge.I'm not an expert at this just yet, so I'm going to need my manual.  The problem is, I left it at the workshop... which happens to be that burning building next to the mine.  Think you could go salvage it?11909Clearly this Gearmaster Mechazod creature is not in his right mind. If his offer of a cure and immortality means all of us becoming robotic slaves then he must be stopped!The winds that guide me whisper that he's atop the pumping station out in the middle of the pools to the west.Most likely, he'll be found in the command hut on top of the structure. Go inside and research his works., you must confront Mechazod if we are to survive!11910It's become clear that the instability in the region has had an effect on its indigenous creatures.I've taken a particular interest in the Glacial Ancients and their recent adaptations. I suspect that their transformation into these 'Magic-bound' Ancients may hold clues to our predicament here.For my studies, I'll need samples from both. Do hurry....11911I've learned more in my short time here than in decades of studies.The ancients here are being exposed to incredible levels of arcane energy. It's literally transforming them into something...I'm confident that there's a final stage in their metamorphosis. Find me some evidence of their final state.11912Oh! What a relief it is to see a fresh face. I was beginning to feel we had been forsaken.Our supply lines were cut off days ago, and things have been looking - well, bleak. To be honest, this was a suicide mission to begin with if you ask me.Maybe I'm simply not cut out for all of this violence - to say nothing of the bitter cold! I'd much rather be back in Dalaran studying ancient texts.To the point, our food supply is nearly spent. Please, gather what you can and bring it to me.11913I heard what you told Gerald and I don't like it one bit.  If cultists managed to poison the grain in the mines with their foul plague, they could've easily done the same with the grain outside.We don't have time to sort the good grain from the bad.  We must act quickly and burn it all.Take this torch and set fire to any sacks of grain you find out here.  It would be a tragedy if we survived this attack only to succumb to the plague afterwards.11914Our existence here depends entirely upon staying hidden. Should the shield fail, even for a moment, Malygos' minions would have us.One of my responsibilities is to rejuvenate the warmages' mana levels so their focus doesn't falter. With our supply lines lost, I've been forced to improvise.I could use your help, .Very near the Nexus, Arcane Serpents feast on the abundant magical energies. Once defeated, they will yield a mana essence that I can make use of.11915Are you interested in learning some hot new skills?I don't know if you'll ever be able to match my own considerable skill, but you can probably pick up a trick or two if you're an attentive student. Speak to a Master Flame Eater at any Horde capital. They should be able to help you.11916You have faced all challenges that have been set before you and squashed them beneath your boot heel. It is because of you, , that the Horde is now firmly entrenched in Northrend.But our work has only just begun. We must march to Icecrown and we must tear down its walls!Your next assignment begins to the east, at Taunka'le Village. Our taunka allies are in dire straits and require aid. Secure transport from the stable master, Durkot Wolfbrother, and seek out Chieftain Wintergale at Taunka'le.11917We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.Return to the camp on the Zoram Strand with the large ice stones. They use them to communicate with the elementals, as they do in Silithus. Much as I am loath to do this, the spirits will understand - you must summon one of this Ahune's lieutenants and destroy it. Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11918This is war, mortal, and we are the tip of the spear.Your little spats over land or currency pale in comparison to this conflict. We face the aspect Malygos and his entire blue dragonflight. All you need to know is that if he is victorious, this world shall be no more.We are but few here, and we fly against many. Our deaths are all but a certainty, and our ultimate success lies in merely delaying our enemy.Go now. Busy yourself while I decide what to do with you.11919The blues have begun to cover their drakes in mysterious runes. I must discover their significance.Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires.Their hatchlings feed around the northwest edge of the valley.11920This altar bears all the markings of the Cult of the Damned.  It appears fanatics from the mainland have made it into Northrend.  It might be prudent to notify the captain of the ship.Perhaps he is to be found above deck.11921Hello, fire juggler!  Are you having fun and making fiery mayhem?  That's what I like to hear!  Now, do you think you're an expert at torch tossing?  Then I have a test for you...You know the rules: toss torches at the marked braziers.  This time, however, you have a little more time and a LOT more braziers to hit.Ready?11922So you want to be a fire juggler?  Do you have what it takes?  The dexterity?  The reflexes?  ...the courage?  If you think so, then let's give you a little practice!Take these torches and run near the bonfire.  You'll see  braziers with markers flashing above them.  Toss a torch at a marked brazier.  Be quick! Do it before the mark fades if you want credit for the toss!Hit enough marked braziers before the time limit, then come back here... for your next lesson.11923Now that you can throw a torch, let's see if you can catch one!Take this stack of unlit torches.  Go to the bonfire and throw a torch high into the air.  Catch it before it hits the ground... then throw it back up!  Catch four in a row, then come back to me.Careful! They're dangerous if they hit the ground!  And don't miss any catches!  If you do then you'll have to go back to the bonfire and start over.  Good luck!11924Torch catching sure keeps you on your toes.  Think you can keep it up for a long time?Let's see...11925Torch catching sure keeps you on your toes.

Her name's Leryssa.I don't think she knows you, but she said she needed your help.  She sounded really desperate.11928My lads should be able to take it from here, .  Valiance Keep is built to take a beating far worse than this.  I worry about our farmlands and mine in Farshire, however.We sent a full detachment to protect our mining operations right before the invasion - they should be able to defend the civilians.Gerald Green's in charge of the villagers there. There's a passage out of the northern wall out of Valiance Keep; it'll take you straight to him.  See what you can do to help them.11929We are lost, . This place has been our home for many generations, but it is no longer safe. There remains only death... Death and a memory of what used to be.I have called for the evacuation of Taunka'le. All remaining taunka must leave at once and make their way to our capital city, Icemist, located in the Dragonblight.You must help get my people to safety, . Mother Tauranook awaits you at the village gates. Hurry! The Scourge closes in from all sides!11930The path across Transborea, to the east, is the only way to reach the Dragonblight. Many perils await you as you make your journey across the tundra. Beware the Scourge and its influence upon the beasts of the land. Rumors have started to spread about our very own taunka brothers and sisters rising from the dead and attacking caravans on their way to the Dragonblight! Defend your caravan and get the evacuees to safety!Wartook Iceborn waits for you across the bridge leading into the Dragonblight.11931I sense a distinct peculiarity in the drakes here but the meaning of the runes that cover their bodies still eludes me.Without a codex, it will take more time than we can afford for me to interpret them.Not far from here is a Kirin Tor traitor, Caleras, who is likely to have a copy of the tome I require. His underlings hold the runes I will need for my translation.Hurry, mortal. Malygos gains strength with every passing moment.11932Listen, .  No offense, but the operation they put Thassarian in charge of was pure suicide.A handful of our men were to launch an attack on the biggest Scourge presence in the area.  Call me crazy, but storming a Scourge ziggurat outside a plagued Nerubian city with a dozen men ain't my idea of fun.If you're still interested in finding Thassarian, we were supposed to arrange for passage east with a tuskarr by the name of Ataika in Kaskala to the northeast.  Good luck with your fool's errand.11933This flame, stolen from the heart of the Exodar itself, floods you with warmth. This raw power is foreign to you, but the Talespinner might know more...11934Today you unlock a page in your spellbook, one you may not have realized it was there.  Bring me something, and I'll open it up for you.11935This flame, stolen from Silvermoon, floods you with warmth. This raw power is foreign to you, but the Loremaster might know more...11936Our goals here are simple. We are to remain hidden from Malygos, observe his brood, and thwart his efforts wherever possible. To that end, I have a task for you.The blues are laying their eggs at the base of the Nexus. Exposure to so much arcane energy will surely make them hatch sooner, and there's no telling what effect it will have on their spawn.I don't intend to find out. Slay the local wyrmkin and use their frozen axes to break the eggs.11938Now that we have this phylactery, I shouldn't have any problems getting the information I need.  It won't take long for the Scourge in the Temple City to notice something's up, however.I won't be able to fend off a full scale attack here.  Or maybe I would... but I'd rather not find out.I want you to head down there and inflict some casualties.  Hopefully they'll be distracted long enough for these two to spill their guts... figuratively, of course.  Take Lurid with you, he might be of aid.11940I need more drake hatchlings to continue researching the runes covering their bodies.They can be found around the northwest edge of the valley....Take this and use it on one of them. Wait for it to become subdued, then bring it here to me before it expires.11941Something about this scrap of metal prevents you from casting it aside.Perhaps Raelorasz might be able to shed some light on its purpose.11942The lich has spoken, .  The high priests of En'kilah hold the secret to entering Naxxanar.Go to the Spire of Blood, the Spire of Pain and the Spire of Decay and slay each of the priests.Return once you've obtained the three scrolls.11943You've discovered a fragment of a special prison, .Malygos' minions use similar prisons to hold their captured mages and other arcane entities, but this prison was constructed to hold something... stronger.In hopes that the enemy of our enemy will prove to be a friend, you must search for the prison's remaining fragments.They are likely to be in the possession of Malygos' most trusted underlings.11944Our situation is nearly hopeless.  We were ordered to take the Wailing Ziggurat with a handful of men.We'll be lucky if we can hold this position against the Scourge.  We're outnumbered, injured and have no escape route.If you can take some of the pressure off of us, we might be able to solidify our position.  Kill some of the undead circling the structure - we'll hold off their advance.11945Dark times are upon us.  Karkut's spirit walks the earth and gathers the spirits of dead tuskarr.The sons of the mist have taken many of our brethren.  Soon dear Kaskala will be reduced to ashes.There is hope yet.  Not for us perhaps, but we've sent our families to Unu'pe.  We fight here so there may be a future for them.They will need supplies or they will starve.  There's not enough food in Unu'pe.  Salvage any supplies before it's too late for our families.11946I am... free?I was destined to spend an eternity roaming an empty abyss, and now am saved? You cannot fathom my gratitude, mortal.When I refused to bend to his will Malygos bound me to that prison, then shattered it and scattered the pieces. Should I live one hundred of your lifetimes, I shall not forget this kindness.Perhaps, in time, I will find ways to repay you. For now, though, we must focus our attention on Malygos. I am weak, and there is much to be done.I need your help, .11947We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.There is a camp located in the shadow of Ethel Rethor within northwestern Desolace. There, they use ice stones to communicate with the elementals, as they do in Silithus. Much as I am loath to do this, the spirits will understand - you must summon one of this Ahune's lieutenants and destroy it. Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11948We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.Neptulon has long had a base of operations on an island in western Stranglethorn. There, the Twilight Cult has set up ice stones to communicate with the Tidehunter's realm, much like they do in Silithus. Much as I am loath to do this, the spirits will understand - you must summon one of this Ahune's lieutenants and destroy it. Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11949Kaskala is a sacred place for us, .  Our ancestors were guided here by the spirit of Tayutka herself.Now these foul creatures attack us from the mists without any provocation.We will show them that our spears are not merely for whaling.  Fight alongside us, friend.  Perhaps my people might repay you some time in the future.11950Listen, .  Warriors like me are replaceable.  If I fall, my brothers and cousins will pick up my spear and fight.My people cannot survive without wise elders.  Stubborn Muahit, our most venerable shaman, refuses to leave the altar to Tayutka in the central island.  We would suffer a significant loss if he was slain by these monsters.You are an outsider, maybe he'll listen to you.  Show him reason... ask him to flee to the safety of Unu'pe before it's too late.11951During my captivity I was able to learn much about Malygos. Fate now allows us to use this knowledge against him.There is a great blue dragon, Saragosa, who circles high above the Nexus. She serves both as the aspect's guardian and as his consort. If any serious threats arise, she alerts her master of the danger.I suffered greatly at the hand of Saragosa during my captivity, and now her time to die has come. First, however, we must fashion the perfect bait....11952We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.Firewatch Ridge in Searing Gorge is an established bastion of Twilight Cult activity. Recently, they have been using ice stones in the cave to communicate with the Tidehunter's realm, much like they do in Silithus. Much as I am loath to do this, the spirits will understand - you must summon one of this Ahune's lieutenants and destroy it. Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11953We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.Silithus is the Azerothian base of the Twilight Cult. In the north, they have been using new ice stones to communicate with the Tidehunter's realm.

Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11954We must act to preserve the balance! Time is against us.In order to ensure Ahune's success, the cult has established a base near the Dark Portal itself in Draenor. They use ice stones to coordinate the frost lord's arrival. Much as I am loath to do this, the spirits will understand - you must summon one of this Ahune's templar protectors and destroy it. Perhaps this forestalling action will be enough...11955I believe you are strong enough for the ultimate task set before us.We cannot allow the plot between the Twilight Cult and the naga heretics of Neptulon to come to fruition. For the sake of Azeroth and all life upon it, we must act. Our path is clear. You must journey to the Slave Pens deep within Coilfang Reservoir and meet with our shaman there. Go, and quickly!11956No time for small talk, .  I was sent on what was to be a suicide mission to take this ziggurat.  I've accomplished my duty as a soldier, now is the time to get some answers.This lich has knowledge I seek, yet I cannot inflict pain to his physical body to obtain that knowledge.The lich stored his soul in a phylactery, and while it remains hidden, I won't be able to pry the information from him.Return to the camp and take my horse, Dusk, she will lead you to the phylactery.  Bring it to me.11957Using the mana crystals you provided, I have created this Power Focus.Saragosa is a glutton. She will be unable to resist its lure. Inside it lie magics that will greatly diminish her power. Let us hope she does not see through my ruse....Prepare yourself, , and speak to me again when you are ready to face Saragosa.11958The wolvar have always been our natural enemies. But the incursion of your peoples into the Great Dragonblight has forced them into a small space upon the glade to the north.Combined with the land's upheaval this morning, they have become even more aggressive than ever before. They have made several raids upon our goods... things that we'll need if we are to survive the trek from our home here.As a sign of good faith and friendship, retrieve our goods from the Snowfall Glade wolvar.11959Already it goes from bad to worse. There is only one course to take... regrettably, Loguhn must die!He's the alpha male of the Snowfall Glade tribe and one mean wolvar. But it's the only way to get a short break from their attacks and stealing forays.You will find the \"Render of Flesh\" in front of his hovel upon the northern rise of the glade. It's larger than the others and hard to miss. Kill him and smear his blood upon yourself, both to show your dominance and respect.11960We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.11961Powerful spirits watch over my tribe -- Kaskala will not be lost.Issliruk will give us courage, Tayutka will make sure our survivors always have food and shelter and Karkut will watch over the fallen so they do not lose their way.Issliruk's guidance is the one we need the most right now.  I asked my nephew, Iruk, to bring me Issliruk's totem, but the Kvaldir's spears struck him down and his body fell into the waters to the north.  Bring me the totem, .  Don't let my nephew's death be in vain.11962That's it then.  With the last of the ore you salvaged we now have enough to send to Valiance Keep.If Farshire is wiped off the face of Azeroth, then at least let us be remembered as the first ones to defend our land and the last ones to give up.Take this ore to Hilda Stoneforge - she is a good friend of mine.  Tell her to make some good weapons with this ore.  We'll need plenty of them in the days to come.11963Farshire is overrun and all that Gerald can think of is to get me my ore shipment?  I swear that man has as much heart as any of our soldiers on the frontlines.We cannot let the civilians lose their lands if they're willing to fight for them.  We might not have the troops to spare, but we can send them weapons.These were earmarked for new recruits, but I'll be able to cover those with the ore you've brought me.  Send word to Gerald that weapons are on the way.11964Did you know that our festival fires burn in every land with an Alliance settlement? Flame Wardens tend to them in camps outside of each town, ensuring the bonfires are bright and the celebrations continue.With each Flame Warden is a summer scorchling -- an emissary to the elemental spirits of fire.Would you like to honor a scorchling, ?

He must rouse every dragon he commands to face Malygos.11968The spirits have heard our cry for help, .  It's a sign that Kaskala might yet be saved.Take advantage of the confusion the weather has created and slay the Kvaldir leader.  Your actions will sway the battle in our favor, I am sure of it.11969We owe this opportunity in great part to your efforts, .It is only fitting that you initiate the attack on Malygos.Take this spark and use it to light the signal fire northwest of the Nexus.

If it were not for your emissary, the surviving refugees may have given up hope. While she may not be taunka by birthright, the tribe has taken to her as a village elder for the time being.If you are who I think you are, please go and pay Emissary Brighthoof a visit inside the refugee camp. She has been waiting for you.11978Before we can officially bring these taunka into the Horde we must recover our armaments from the Anub'ar Nerubians that infest the nearby woods. The armaments were lost when a caravan from Agmar's Hammer was ambushed by the Scourge late last night.Venture out into the woods to the east of Westwind Refugee Camp and recover those armaments, .11979The Scourge have seized control of the capital city of the taunka, Icemist Village! All living taunka that escaped the massacre are being held in protective custody at the Westwind Refugee Camp on the western border of Dragonblight.Lord Hellscream believes that the taunka must join the Horde if they are to survive and has sent a tauren emissary to Westwind to bolster our relationship with the winter tauren. Travel to Westwind Refugee Camp and seek out Emissary Brighthoof. You will assist her.11980I was one of the guards chosen to escort the caravan carrying the armament shipment to this camp. The attack came fast and without warning. We fought and killed dozens of the beasts, but in the end there were simply too many. Tor'zin and I barely made it out alive...If not for our injuries we would be out in the woods hunting down those fiends ourselves. Will you help us regain our lost pride? Search the woods east of here for Anub'ar Nerubians and kill them! For the Horde!11981The Earthen warrior's stone surface is covered with cracks and gouges. Although it is incapable of bleeding, you can sense that the warrior is near death.A low, hoarse voice escapes from the dying warrior's mouth.\"Find... Kurun... you must find... Kurun.\"It looks at you helplessly as you ask for any clues as to who or what Kurun might be.\"Our... leader... he stands on the... hill overlooking Thor Modan... commands us. Please... tell him... we cannot take... the city... \"11982Beneath us is iron's ancient bastion, Thor Modan. Thousands of years ago, the stone giants tore the land asunder, collapsing part of the city and exposing much of the rest.Even now, the iron dwarves attempt to reclaim their old capital, but we will not permit it. My giants fill the trench with boulders and debris, hoping to seal it off and kill the servants of iron as they work. Take up the boulders you see near the trench to the northeast, and help us put an end to their efforts.11983They are ready, . These taunka will all willingly join the Horde and give all that they have to see the Scourge driven from this world.Within this scroll you will find the blood oath of the Horde.

Return the scroll to me when you have completed your duty.11984'Ol Budd's seen better days.Ever since our stay in Ghostlands he's been useless to us. We've had to find ways to make it on our own, and today that means sellin' trolls to the highest bidder.Fortunately, we've recently found a use for Budd. Something about his condition allows him to mingle with the local trolls, so we taught him a little game that's turned us a tidy profit.See for yourself. Talk to Budd, take him southwest to Drak'Zin Ruins and use this cage as soon as he tags a troll.11985If we can't overcome the defenders inside Thor Modan, the iron dwarves can hold out forever. The Earthen are bravely taking on the constructs built by the sons of iron, but they cannot break into the city.The tunnels narrow too quickly for my fellow giants to be of use, so our options are few. Would you be willing to venture into the city and kill the dwarf commanding the resistance?11986This battered, mud-stained journal has seen better days. Leafing through the pages, you discover dozens of notes, diagrams, and maps.The author's handwriting seems vaguely familiar, but you're unable to place it until you discover an entry signed with the name of Brann Bronzebeard.The back half of the book, containing the most recent entries, has been torn away. Pages litter the battlefield, and it will be impossible to know what Brann discovered here until the book is whole again.11988Brann's journal mentions that he used a runic keystone to illuminate the important runes on the plate he discovered. Without the keystone, the plate's contents would be little better than gibberish.At the end of Brann's last entry, he describes the iron dwarf defenders seizing the keystone from him, shattering it, and dividing it among themselves. Before we can decipher the runed plate, we must hunt down the fragments. Any of the dwarves within Thor Modan or the buildings around it may carry fragments.11989Watch yerself, mon.Drakuru shrunk more  heads than I can remember - and even if I could remember, I couldn't count that high.

Now that we've reassembled the runic keystone -- well, most of it -- we can decipher the contents of those very same runic plates Brann was working on before he fled.We have no way of knowing if he managed to read the contents of all three plates, but we'll have to assume he got enough information to determine his next destination.Stand before each of the plates and use the keystone to determine the contents of each.

There's no way we can excavate anything until that place settles down.You seem like a brave sort, though, and you have Stoutmantle's trust.Thor Modan is just to the northeast of us and the battle still rages between our Earthen brothers and the creations of those accursed iron dwarves. Help our brethren to even the odds and I'll start figuring out how we're going to accomplish this survey of Thor Modan.12003The first place we'll search for entrances to the Thor Modan tunnel system will be the outlying buildings.As I left the site with my men, it looked like the iron dwarf defenders were taking refuge inside the buildings. Be careful as you explore them.Any tunnel entrances are likely to be toward the back of the buildings. I'm not sure what Stoutmantle thinks we're going to find down there, but I doubt the iron dwarves will make the search easy.12004We need to kill two birds with one stone here, .

Will you retrieve them for me? I'm too old for that sort of thing and the waters can be very dangerous.Please, take this bladder. It will help you to breathe while you're down there.12010When we began excavating the city, I sent Surveyor Orlond to check the stability of the tunnels in Thor Modan. I didn't see him escape when we withdrew at the beginning of the battle, and I worry he may still be trapped inside the city.If we're going to get an army through Thor Modan, we'll need the information he was collecting. Stoutmantle and his superiors would have my hide if the tunnels collapsed on one of their brigades!12011This crab trap appears to have been destroyed by something much larger than the nearby circling sharks.Perhaps Tua'kea, the fisherman at Moa'ki Harbor, should be told about this?12012This information must be spread to the entirety of the Earthen Ring.

I'm still puzzled as to how the worms are killing them so easily. Bring me a sample from one of his wounds.12076Even at first glance, the sample you brought me shows obvious signs of some kind of corrosive spit.

Unleash the power stored in the stone and observe the results.If it works, the runed giants should return to their senses and stop obeying the iron dwarves.

They've been plaguing us whenever we turn our backs... I've had enough!To the south you'll find the snobolds hiding under the skirts of some of the local magnataur. Go slaughter them.If the magnataur interfere on behalf of their slaves, kill them as well.12143I can't believe this! Another band of those vermin just tried to take off with more of our supplies. They're scurrying off towards that north canyon, get after them and deal with whoever they're going to!12144Oi, mon! One of dose little snobold runts trashed our camp during da last dragon attack. Dey've been houndin us wheneva we turn our backs and I've had enough. To da east you'll find da snobolds hiding under da skirts of some of da local magnataur. Go slaughter dem. If da magnataur interfere on behalf of deir slaves, kill dem as well.12145I can't believe dis! Another band of dose vermin just tried ta take off with more of our supplies. Dey're scurrying down da canyon now, get after dem and deal with whoever dey're going to!12146The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a Magnataur.Take the horn south down the Path of the Titans to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications.12147The underside of the horn boasts an emblazoned seal with a hammer and a lightning bolt. Something about the horn seems extremely out of place on a Magnataur. Take the horn east across the Dragon Wastes to Wyrmrest and seek out someone who might be interested in these threatening implications.12148Such a strange seal to see among magnataur... it suggests an unusual amount of organization.Magnataur rarely put aside their aggressive natures to cooperate with each other.  I suspect they have their eyes set on raiding a large settlement.I very much doubt that this horn is unique, I need you to prove me wrong. In the canyon northwest of the Azure Dragonshrine you will find Bonesunder. Go challenge him and bring me back any evidence you find that might confirm my concerns.12149Magnataur are hideously violent creatures... this is the main reason we rarely see them come together in any real numbers without killing each other. A powerful leader has stepped up somewhere among them and we need to hunt him down if we are to stop this threat. I will start asking around. I need you to disrupt them as much as possible in the meantime.East of here there are 3 torches erected. Near them, there are 3 dominant Magnataur - put them down to buy us some time to hunt down this leader.12150Dregmar Runebrand is a magnataur runemaster... a rare breed. He's generally solitary, but has been known to associate with the more powerful and influential magnataur in Dragonblight for quite some time. He will know who this new leader is. It is unlikely we will gain any aid with the increasing concerns with the Scourge and the blue flight, so I need you to procure the information from Dregmar by any means necessary.I was told he can be found amongst the cliffs overlooking the Mirror of the Dawn.12151There's no reason to suspect Dregmar's words are anything but true. Whether Grom'thar defeats you or is defeated by you, he can wash his hands of this.Follow his instructions... take the horn that you brought me earlier, travel to the ring of torches south of the Azure Dragonshrine, and blow it to announce your challenge.When Grom'thar the Thunderbringer arrives, kill him and bring me his head.12152It is good to see you back among the living. Many who travel the path of the dead do not return to speak of it.While you were away, a vision appeared to Kraz revealing what remains to be done.A sacred offering lies somewhere inside the crypt. Take this spirit dust fashioned from the remnants you collected and use it on the offering.The infused offering will bring an end to the corrupted warlord and will release the many tormented souls.May the spirits guide your actions, .12153Now that you've charged up your war golem, we're going to put all that energy to good use. Activate the golem inside Dun Argol to take control of it.Our  information about Dun Argol's leader, Iron Thane Furyhammer, suggests his bodyguard protects him from all harm.That bodyguard is the construct he travels with, called The Anvil. Disable the construct, and his protection will disappear.The thane stays in the building at the top of Dun Argol and supervises production from the bottom level.12154The large hall at the top of Dun Argol houses the power source for the entire area. If you can destroy the power core, it will cripple Dun Argol for some time.No power means no golems, no sentries, and no more lightning armaments.When we were sent up here, they told us these explosives were for excavation, but thanks to Iron Thane Furyhammer, the research has been scrapped. We may as well get some use out of them, though. They're the only thing we have on hand capable of destroying the power core.12155This large jack-o'-lantern rests in the middle of the village.  It eyes those who look upon it, betraying a dark menace within.Smashing the pumpkin reveals an old, scorched holy symbol.12157We're lucky we made it this far, .  We were ambushed by Scourge as soon as we landed.One of our men turned out to be a spy for the Cult of the Damned.  Thassarian appears to have more evidence of cultist infiltration.  Apparently it goes all the way to the top.I've sent one of my best couriers to our outpost in western Dragonblight, but he has not yet returned. I fear he may have fallen to the Scourge. Will you go to Dragonblight and search for him? Courier Lanson is his name.12158I've been meaning to send some of our lads to check out Hollowstone Mine.  Haven't had a chance to yet -- we've had our hands full between the Horde on the west and the iron dwarves to the east.If Dumont sent you, though, the least I can do is point you in the right direction.You'll find the mine entrance to the northwest, not far from here.  See if you think operations there can be salvaged.  We sure could use the additional resources until our mine in Farshire is operational again.12159My comrades... we must put their souls to rest!  I kill them and kill them but.. they just come back!I've had an idea for a while but I just don't have the heart to do it myself.Maybe you can do this for me?  Take this lantern and use its oil to burn their remains so they never get up again.I'll answer your questions later.  Help my friends first!12160It worked!  It worked!  My comrades can finally enjoy their well-earned rest...I'll stay here and finish the job.  We Hollowstone miners always finish the job -- we never give up!That's why Arugal made an example of us.  We wouldn't fall in line, you see?  We wouldn't join his wolfcult!12161Hey there.  I overheard what you were saying to the captain and I just want you to know...  things aren't that simple in Northrend.Just because someone's dead it doesn't mean they're out of the picture.Southwest of here, near Vordrassil Pass, lives a blind woman who goes by the name Ruuna the Blind.  They say she speaks to the dead and has visions of the past and future.I haven't heard your whole story but it sounds like she'd be right up your alley.12164It is time, then, .  Arugal must be defeated.Get a couple of people you can trust and head for Bloodmoon Isle.  It's just off the coast, east of here.We'll hit them fast.  Take out Arugal's lieutenants -- I'll catch up with you when it's time to take out the monster himself.12165Prospector Rokar has decided to help us. He's concocted a plan to use the iron dwarves' strength against them.I must admit, our new 'friend' is more insightful than I'd given him credit for. He's correct in that our numbers are too few for a direct attack.Travel to Dun Argol, in the snowy regions to the southeast, and capture all the parts of their war golem blueprints from the iron rune-smiths there. Bring the assembled blueprint to Rokar and we'll see if his plan has any merit.12166 will you assist me?The Scourge have moved into Icemist to the north. Wherever they go, they spread their taint, and the creatures of the land suffer.Take this vial, which is filled with the liquid fire of Elune from the moonwell. Please, use the liquid to cleanse the corpses of the blighted wildlife that you find.12167The Anub'ar cultists are indirectly responsible for the plaguing of the beasts, and we must put an end to it!The fumes that emit from the cultists' suits seep into everything they come near, poisoning and corrupting their surroundings.You must go north to Icemist Village and slay them. Bring back any of their suits that survive your assault and I will see to it that they are properly disposed of.12168An inscription on the back of the favor reads,\"To my favorite pupil,If you continue to show promise, I will teach you wonders beyond your imaginings.If you do not, I will have you destroyed!As ever,High Cultist Zangus\"No doubt the warden at Stars' Rest will want to see this.12169I have dreamed of Zangus before but without the context that you have discovered, I knew not what it meant. You have brought clarity to the vision that the goddess has bestowed upon me, and now I know that he can be found within the Pit of Narjun to the north.You know your target, . If there's to be an end to the suffering of the land, the high cultist must die!12170The Venture Company abandoned operations shortly after we showed up.  Clearly they were afraid of what we were going to do to their greedy little hides.With them gone, their logging camps are up for grabs.  Our war machine is a hungry beast... without renewing our supplies we won't make it to Icecrown.Unfortunately the Alliance seems to have the same idea and we must make sure we're the ones that prevail.  Head into the logging camp and help us fight the Alliance scum.12171The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of Dragonblight.If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic.Hurry, . Show the document to Palena Silvercloud here at Stars' Rest and explain the nature of your mission. She will put you on her fastest hippogryph to Wintergarde!12172Welcome, mage.By now you must be wondering where Dalaran is and how to get there. I will help you.But before I can teach you how to teleport to our great city, you must attune yourself to the ley lines of Northrend. Otherwise, you risk destroying yourself in the process.Take this attunement crystal and use it in the pit under the surge needle at the Moonrest Gardens to the west. Then you will be ready to learn the spell.12173Hello, mage.By now you must be wondering where Dalaran is and how to get there. I can help you with this if you can survive a simple test.Before I teach you how to teleport to our great city, you must attune yourself to the ley lines of Northrend. Otherwise, you will destroy yourself in the process!Take this attunement crystal and use it in the pit under the surge needle at the Moonrest Gardens to the southwest. Then you will be ready to learn what I have to teach.12174Snowstorm will take you to Wintergarde, . I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!12175Let me tell you something, mon.  When you get put in charge of outfittin' the armies of the Horde, you go through a lot of hides!Conqueror Krenna, the she-wolf runnin' this place, she gave me a tight deadline.  If I don't outfit her whole regiment by week's end she's gonna have me wrestling bears in the pit.Help me out and I'll pay you top price.  I'll be needin' hides from graymist hunters.You'll find them all around in pockets to the north, hunting stag.  Remember, mon.  Top price!12176Krenna, she be wantin' worg hides for all the outfits.  There's not gonna be enough worg hides for her army, though.  Not now, not ever.Those worgs -- they be skinny, mon!  Here's what we're gonna do... if you can keep a secret that is.East of Voldrune there be grizzly bears as fat as an ogre.  Those large hides -- those we can use!Hurry, .  Krenna's not known for her patience.12177Ah, we have a small problem.  Grizzly hides... they be brown, mon!Think... think!I got it, mon!  Is like this: gray is black an' white all mixed up.  You get me some coal an' some flour, I'll grind it all up and dust the hides with it.  No one will know the better!Blacksmiths sell coal for smeltin' an' you can get flour from the provisioner.12178This is it, mon.  Let's take these hides to Krenna and see if they pass the test.Let's hope for both our sakes Krenna doesn't notice anything.12180Raegar sent a team of prospectors into Dun Argol to search for artifacts and information about the history of the settlement. Raegar's team never expected Dun Argol to be this heavily populated.They're being held captive while the iron dwarves prepare for war. We haven't the men to charge in after them, and Raegar's too busy fantasizing about defeating the irons to be of much help.It falls to you, . Any of the irons or their servants could be carrying the keys to the cages holding our men.12181My, my, how long has it been? How long have we been working on this damned plague? Finally, after an eternity of failure, we are blessed with perfection. This... It doesn't even have a proper name yet! This blight... That's it, BLIGHT! This blight will tear down the very fabric of life!Now, find the bat handler, Tobias, and show him the specimen. He'll get you on your way to Venomspite.12182I got a special bat all lined up for you, buddy. Fastest and smoothest ride I've got. He'll take you right to Venomspite - in style.Just hand that vial over to Chief Plaguebringer Middleton once you land.12183If, as Prospector Varana said, only certain irons are permitted to communicate with this Loken, it'll probably be the overseers who have the privilege.We have to get you in there to see what all this is about, but it won't be easy. The first step will be to get a proper uniform for you.Then, we'll worry about doing your makeup.Find one of the overseers at Dun Argol, kill him, and bring back his uniform. If you get blood on it, you'll have only yourself to blame.12184Now that we've got the uniform, we've got to get enough information to complete your camouflage.Raegar brought along this camera to document the team's finds, but I have a different use in mind. I want you to take it with you to Dun Argol and use it to capture the images of iron dwarves.Of course, your models aren't going to be a cooperative lot, so you may have to, err... subdue them first. Bring back the camera and the images when you're done.12185Using the images you've captured, I've created everything you need for your overseer disguise kit. You'll make a fine iron dwarf, if I do say so myself.Take the kit with you to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.12188The details behind the functionality of the blight are hardly important. All you need to know is that it does the job it was designed to do. I have managed to synthesize a strain of the blight that is inert.See, my body is still, mostly, intact. Now mix this with a reactive agent and we'd all be turned to shapeless piles of goo.On the beach south of here you will find pathetic specters of Alliance soldiers past. Slay them and bring me ectoplasmic residue.12189The shipment from New Agamand was to arrive at Venomspite last week and then be delivered to me after some simple field tests. It is a Horde imperative - the last piece of the \"victory puzzle.\"It is quite disheartening to know that you are surrounded by imbeciles and incompetent boobs!You must travel to Venomspite, near the eastern border of Dragonblight. Find that buffoon, Middleton, and let him know that I am waiting on the package.12190Harkor's gunna drop a gold brick when he sees these choice ingredients. All that be left is gettin' them to him.He's camped out on the eastern coast near dem haunted ruins - Drakil'jin, dey be called.You'll likely be makin' it there before I can finish up with these corpses... unless, ya think you'd rather try your hand at embalming?12191Those pesky Dark Irons are back! We need to make sure that you can defend yourself if needed. More importantly, we need to know that you can defend our property!S.T.O.U.T. here is ready for action, are you? Drink from the Alcohol-Free Brewfest Samplers then throw the mug at S.T.O.U.T.! Hit the target 5 times then talk to me.12192The Dark Irons took a beating!  As they rushed back to the Grim Guzzler, a portion of their transport fell off.  More importantly, you managed to keep the camp safe... today.Head over to Bizzle and explain your heroic triumph over the Dark Iron dwarves.12195A recent hunting expedition brought back more than just game.They encountered a wounded dwarf fleeing the iron dwarf stronghold of Dun Argol. He may have information we can use to strike at our ancient enemy, but before he's of any use to us, we must bring down his fever.The horns of the silvercoat stags, who roam the nearby forest, have long been used to make healing poultices. If you can bring enough of the horns to me, we'll see if the poultice can bring our 'guest' around.12196We don't have enough time for me to forge the parts myself, but the foundries over at Dun Argol, to the southeast, are working day and night to churn out golem parts.I think you should go back there and pick up enough of them for me to make a golem from this blueprint.They're probably scattered around any of the buildings where the iron rune-smiths are working.Please hurry, . That Tormak looks like he's just waiting for an excuse to carry out his threat!12197Well, we've got the shell of a golem, but that's not good enough for Tormak. He doesn't realize that these things don't just come together and miraculously start working! We're going to need power cells to animate it.When I was in Dun Argol, I noticed that Rune-Smith Durar and Rune-Smith Kathorn were the ones who manufactured the cells. We'll need one from each to power our golem.You should be able to find each rune-smith in his workshop on the central level of Dun Argol.12198The golem's cells have just enough power to run it at the lowest levels, but it can't power any of its combat systems.The good news is that the perimeter of Dun Argol is patrolled by lightning sentries. We should be able to use their power to charge up the golem's weapon systems.Bring the golem with you, take it close to them, it will absorb the power as the sentries die.12199Now that the golem is fully charged, it can be used against the leader at Dun Argol.When I observed Iron Thane Furyhammer, he was always guarded by a personal golem that shielded him from all harm.That construct, called The Anvil, can be disrupted, causing him to drop the shield. Use your golem's EMP ability to do just that. You'll be able to activate and take control of your golem inside Dun Argol.The thane is in the main plant at the top and supervises production from the bottom level.12200With an inert specimen of the blight compound complete and the activating agent in hand there only remains a need for a suitable shell to house the components.Southwest of here, on the shores of central Dragonblight, is where you will find the Emerald Dragonshrine. Within the shrine you will find the hardened remnants of a green dragon's tear drop. I don't know the whole story, but apparently they cry a lot right before they die. Go figure.Go to the Emerald Dragonshrine and gather tears.12201It sounds like this Loken is the mastermind behind the sudden preparations for war on the part of the iron dwarves.Only the highest ranking irons are likely to have access to him, so we'll have to make you into an overseer to find out what's going on in there.I have a plan, for that, but we'll need some supplies.Find one of the iron rune overseers at Dun Argol, to the southeast, kill him, and bring back his uniform.12202Now we have to finish the job of making you as repulsive as those iron dwarves.The best way to do that is to base your disguise on the ugly mugs of real iron dwarves.When Tormak's hunting party discovered that wayward prospector, they took the camera he carried. Now, I suppose, we'll get the chance to use it.Take it with you to Dun Argol, kill some iron dwarves, and record their likenesses in this device. Bring it back once you have enough examples.12203I've created everything else you'll need for your overseer disguise kit. Try not to retch when you put it on. I took pains to make it as true to reality as possible.Take the kit with you southeast to Dun Argol, use it to disguise yourself, then go to the easternmost building on the broad middle tier of the city.There, you should see a pedestal where the thane and overseers receive their orders from this Loken. Activate it while disguised and learn all you can from the communication.12204The iron dwarves stand as one of the fiercest and most coordinated foes in Northrend. Wherever we have traveled, they have battled us with the name of Loken on their lips.We must learn who this Loken is and what he seeks. The locals may be of help.To the northeast, at the Redwood Trading Post, a human named Hugh Glass peddles his wares. Further east, at the Ruins of Tethys, you'll find a stone giant named Gavrock. Ask them about this Loken. They've got to know something of use.12205By order of High Executor Wroth all members of the illegal organization known as the Scarlet Onslaught are to be put to death immediately.No quarter is to be offered, and those proceeding to action upon this decree should be aware that any who are captured by the humans will be left to die, or worse!In the High Executor's words, \"Paint the snow red with their blood!\"12206Have you read the wanted poster? What is the high executor thinking?!We can't very well have those Scarlet Onslaught idiots being raised by their priests, or worse, rising as the Scourge, now can we?No, I'm in total agreement with you, we have to do something about the corpses.I have just the thing. Take this blight that we just created and test it on the prisoner in the cage right here.No muss, no fuss, no returning enemies.12207Long ago, powerful druids planted a tree to the northeast of here.It was called Vordrassil and it was to be a world tree.  It is not known why, but after the tree was fully grown, the druids decided it needed to be destroyed.Ever since we arrived here, the earth has spoken to me, .  Its cries of pain come from the places where Vordrassil's remains fell on the ground.Corrupting ooze roams those places.  Bring me samples of it so we may begin to heal the land.12208Good for nothing wretches!They could have had it easy. We extended our hand in peace. All they had to do was give us passage through Drak'Tharon and we'd have let them be.But no, the prideful little ice trolls decided that they wanted it rough. Now they'll be destroyed and we'll pass through their precious keep to Zul'Drak anyway.We've contracted a gang to deliver us captured trolls. Talk to Samir if you want in on the action. You can find him to the northwest of here, due south of Zeb'Halek.12209Ah good, new meat. Do you wish to prove yourself, new meat?The Scarlet Onslaught, the most zealous and racist of the Scarlet Crusade, are in our backyard to the south. If we're going to fight them, we'll need more armor and weapons than I can make in such a short time.Why don't we take theirs?More to the point, why don't YOU take theirs?12210You, ! No sense standing around here when there's work to be done!Drak'Theron Keep is the most direct route to Zul'Drak. We MUST capture it to ensure safe passage for the Alliance. But until we get the numbers to make an assault, we'll have to content ourselves in thinning out the ice trolls and collecting intel.To that end, we've conscripted a gang of thugs to capture and deliver live trolls for interrogation. Travel northwest and speak with Samir at Granite Springs. He'll direct you further.12211I don't understand it. The blight should have worked!No sense worrying about it now.Though it doesn't work on the Onslaught for some strange reason, we still need to keep their priests from raising them.I have another idea, one that their corpses shouldn't have any protection from., take a container of my rats and unleash them upon any Onslaught corpses you come across at New Hearthglen. I starve the vermin, so they should be voracious!12212G'day, .The good lieutenant here says that there's been a Horde raid on our storehouse that's left our food supply dangerously low.No doubt we'll make those cretins pay, but first we need to focus our attention on restocking. My men are doing all they can, but we're going to need every able body to contribute if we're to avert a crisis.You should have no trouble harvesting venison from the local stag in these parts. Happy hunting!12213Something... dark... happened to the tree Vordrassil.  After the druids decided to destroy it, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground.I want you to go to the three locations to the northeast where the tree's trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can.Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area.  This might shed some light on what happened to Vordrassil and why it failed to become a world tree.12214Hello. I am Hansel. Pleased to meet you, .The high executor came to me and said, 'Hansel, I want you to get us new mounts.'Where does he think dreadsteeds come from? The ground? Actually, they do if you can find a horse graveyard.But we don't have one of those, so what we need you to do is go south to New Hearthglen, kill the knights, take their riding crops, and steal their warhorses.Ride the horse back to me here and hand over the reins, if you would.12215As if we didn't have enough to concern ourselves with....With the present food crisis, we find ourselves competing for food with the local worgs. The situation is becoming more dire, and I fear that if we don't address the issue immediately we'll soon find ourselves with nothing to hunt.Scour the forest, . Kill any graymist you find. Recent reports have sighted a concentration of them on the other side of the river west of here.12216We've all been working hard and it's beginning to pay off, but we're still far from our goal. We need much more meat than we have and it's growing clear that the local stag population won't be enough by itself.I'm afraid we need you to turn your attention to more dangerous prey - the grizzlies that give this region its name. They're plentiful, and they're well fed from the abundant fish that swim in these streams.Be safe, !12217Well, , we've determined how the Horde was able to locate our hidden stores of food.It turns out that they were binding their sight to the unsuspecting eagles that soar above the trees here. Using eagle vision, they were able to effectively spy on our every action.By order of the lieutenant, we've got to hunt down these majestic birds in order to thwart our enemy.12218Before I can ship you off to Doctor Malefious with the good news, you will have to run a simple field test of the blight with the modifications I have made.The hungering dead stream out from what remains of Old Wintergarde. Commandeer a vehicle from the east gate and drive it northeast through Vengeance Pass until you reach the twin towers at the southeastern edge of Wintergarde. Drop the blight bomb on the undead that cover the area. Report back to me with the results!12219My ancestors once planted a tree in the middle of the Grizzly Hills.It was called Vordrassil and it was to become a world tree.For reasons long forgotten, after the tree was fully grown, they decided it needed to be destroyed.  Its giant trunk splintered at three locations in the area to the north.Where the tree touched the ground, foul ooze began to crawl the earth.  Bring me slime samples so I can begin my work and the earth can be healed.12220When the tree Vordrassil fell, its hollow remains grew roots deep into the ground.I want you to go north of here to the three locations where the trunk shattered and go as far beneath the ground as you can.  You'll find them west of Grizzlemaw.Use this orb once you get there to get an imprint of the energy surrounding the area.  If we're to heal the land, we must first find out what caused Vordrassil to fail as a world tree all those years ago.12221I have prepared a package that must be delivered to Doctor Sintar Malefious at Agmar's Hammer. The contents of the package include the final blight specimen along with instructions on preparation and samples of the reactive agent.You will find Agmar's Hammer in western Dragonblight. Just look for the black, jagged metal orc buildings - that will be Agmar's Hammer.12222Even as we attempt to fight off the Horde, the Dragonflayer tribe musters in their village of Voldrune, near the coast to the south.The most powerful warriors in the village are granted flame-imbued talismans that give them the ability to control powerful, savage proto-drakes. If we can gain control of one of these drakes, perhaps we can use it to neutralize the threat posed by Voldrune.The Dragonflayer flamebinders create the talismans and imbue them with power. Kill them and take the talismans.12223There's a flurry of activity down in Voldrune village to the south. Thane Torvald Eriksson and his huscarls are preparing for war. With most of our men in the field dealing with the Horde's treachery, Amberpine will be vulnerable.Travel to Voldrune, which is near the southern coast, and show those Dragonflayers we're no soft target.Slay as many of the huscarls as you can find. Make them think twice about taking advantage of our conflict with the Horde.12224You have done well, . All that you have faced, you have done as a champion of the Horde. The Scourged Anub'ar of Azjol-Nerub, crushed under your foot! The taunka, brave and powerful new members of the Horde, because of you! Our super-weapon against the Scourge, tested and perfected by you!The time has come, the moment is now - our elite soldiers at the Wrathgate need you. The son of Saurfang awaits your arrival at the Kor'kron Vanguard. Go now, northeast to the Wrathgate.12225Your stomach growls as the pungent smell of hearty nuts draws your attention to the bucket of seeds.Some thoughtful soul has obviously left these complimentary morsels here to rejuvenate weary visitors. Grateful, you take the remaining few and devour them.The seeds do not disappoint. Finding yourself hungry for more, you set out to discover their origins....12226We must act quickly, ! We can't risk letting those precious seeds become fully digested. They need to come out, NOW.Forage up some blackroot from the riverbank just west of here and I'll make you a purgative that should get things moving.Hurry now! And remember, you brought this upon yourself....12227Alright, . Here's the juice.It works immediately, so don't use it until you're safely inside the outhouse.Now go get me those seeds!12229Not long ago we sent an expedition to the east, where it was attacked by crazed furbolgs.  One of the survivors described slaying one of them and its body expelling a dark slimy substance.For thousands of years, the furbolgs in this region have been peaceful.  It is possible that there is a link to the furbolgs' behavior and the dark energy we were able to detect earlier.Bring me samples of the furbolgs' blood.  You will find them to the east in the Rage Fang Shrine and the Heart's Blood Shrine.12230I'm tasked with the destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught's ballistae. Unfortunately, the apothecaries and I are at odds on the use of our resources, so I've nothing to destroy them with!To the northeast are the Carrion Fields. The Scourge siegesmiths there at their forge and meat wagons are demolition masters.Luckily for us, they also leave their bombs lying about. I want you to retrieve them for me, off of the ground or the siegesmiths, I don't care which.12231It is possible that the furbolg of Grizzly Hills have the same taint that plagued Vordrassil.  They've been involved in a deadly tribal war recently after years of peaceful coexistence.The shrines that they guard to the east are home to Ursoc's offspring.If the corruption has affected the furbolg, it is possible that because of their lineage, Kodian and Orsonn have remained unharmed.If that's the case, find them and listen to what they have to say.12232At last, our chance to strike at their siege engines! Don't flub it.I kid.A little., bombard New Hearthglen's ballistae with these bombs.We'll show the Royal Apothecary Society how it's done old style. No concoctions required!12234I need to know what New Hearthglen is up to.I want you to steal their orders of the day so that I can find that out.Head south and in their abbey, in their barracks, and on their beach, find those daily plans!Just in case you're confused, the barracks is the large building right next to the smithy.12235Lord Fordragon has led a crushing assault against Arthas at the Wrathgate. In response to this affront, Arthas has sent Naxxramas down upon us. While Kel'Thuzad hides in the floating citadel, his ground commander, Thel'zan, lays siege to Wintergarde Keep. The lower village is already lost and any chance of extracting survivors from the ruins diminishes by the minute.We must act quickly! Report to Gryphon Commander Urik at the gryphon station at once! He'll get you up to speed.Leave me!12236The time has come, .  Now we will learn whether our efforts will accomplish what we need or nothing at all.Take these ashes and seek the furbolg that Kodian told you about, Tur Ragepaw, near Ursoc's Den.  You will find the den to the north of Grizzlemaw.Convince Tur to aid you, for you will need all the help you can get.Once you've defeated the bear god, use these ashes over his body.Even if his worldly form is destroyed, his spirit must be saved.12237With this whistle you can call down a Wintergarde gryphon. Mount the creature and head towards the ruins of Wintergarde Village, now known as the Carrion Fields, southeast of here. Once at the fields, keep your eyes peeled for helpless Wintergarde villagers. When you spot one, fly low and use the gryphon to pick them up. Return the rescued villager here, to the gryphon station.There are Scourge all over the place so you'll need to keep your wits about you, hero. Good luck!12238Drak'Tharon soon be cleansed of them foul undead and restored to her noble purpose. In return for your help, the keep's most valuable treasures be yours, mon!Once ya be reachin' its top, ya must summon me, and I'll perform the ritual.Alas, my summonin' will be comin' at a cost. Ya must collect mojo from the survivors.12239I have a spy within the ranks of the Scarlet Onslaught. I need you to deliver these daily orders to her so that she can plan the next phase of our assault.She goes by the name of Agent Skully and she's under a magical guise to appear as the Onslaught's cemetery caretaker.Here, take these orders to her, and then do as she asks. You'll find the graveyard on the side of the abbey.12240I received a few barrels of termites from my sister at the Bulwark back home in the last shipment. I think they're going to come in handy for something I have in mind for you.The lumbermill operations at New Hearthglen are problematic for us, but so far we haven't been able to get anyone in there to take out their foreman.I think that if you were to unleash these termites on his precious woodworks, he'd be sure to come running.Ready to take him out, ?12241The furbolgs' work must be undone, .  The best of intentions do not count for much when the result is tainted by such strong a corruption.The sapling must be destroyed, for it is the source of this dark influence.  Take this torch and use it to set fire to the corrupted sapling and bring me its ashes.Once cleansed, by fire, I will use what power I can to remove the taint from them.  You will need the ashes to purify Ursoc from the evil power that holds sway over him.12242We must make sure that Vordrassil is never regrown.  The furbolg must have harvested its seed.Go to Grizzlemaw, in central Grizzly Hills, and obtain all the seeds that you can find.  I will make sure they're properly destroyed.12243I have another mission for you.I was able to repurpose some of the blight to concoct my world-famous burning water. I want you to take it and set the sails of the Sinner's Folly ablaze!Use it from the dock. Once the sails are on fire, the deckhands will be busy putting them out, and you'll slip belowdecks to 'retrieve' the captain's rutters.You'll find the ship on Crusader's Landing, below and south of New Hearthglen. Look for the captain's quarters on the first lower deck, behind the stairs.12244Listen, pal. Why don't ya roll up your sleeves and grab a wrench? There's work to be done! They need these shredders refurbished and sent down to Venture Bay, and they need it done yesterday....No wrench? Well what good are ya then? May as well go down with the rest of the lugheads and play with the Horde!While you're there, see if you can drive some of those broken-down shredders up here for repairs. Be careful! They're in pretty bad shape.12245We have more fools for you to kill.My agents tell me that several of our good citizens have seen fit to fall into the hands of the Scarlet Onslaught.This will not do.Go back to New Hearthglen and eliminate Deathguard Schneider, Senior Scrivener Barriga, Engineer Burke and Chancellor Amai.From what I hear, they're spread out throughout the area. No doubt they are being kept in cages awaiting torture.Speak with them and then kill them!12246The furbolgs that live east of here are more aggressive and bestial than the ones we're used to.  Our forces have squared off with them more than once, and the survivors always speak of a dark, slimy substance dripping from their corpses.Their condition could be linked with the contaminants we found on Vordrassil's remains.Bring me samples of the furbolgs' blood.  You will find them in the Rage Fang Shrine and the Heart's Blood Shrine, far to the east.12247The furbolgs of Grizzly Hills carry with them a corruption of some kind, that is for sure.  Tribal war has broken out amongst them after years of peaceful coexistence.What remains to be seen is whether the bears they worship as gods have also been tainted.Ursoc's two children, Orsonn and Kodian, dwell in the Heart's Blood Shrine and the Rage Fang Shrine, south and southeast of Grizzlemaw.See if they will speak to you regarding what has happened here.12248The druids of old seem to have had good reasons for destroying Vordrassil.  We cannot let the furbolgs regrow it.On the other hand, saving Ursoc's spirit hinges on the magic contained by the sapling.Take this torch and use it to burn the tree.  You will find it in the middle of Grizzlemaw, inside Vordrassil's old trunk.Bring me Vordrassil's ashes.  It is my hope that once purified by fire, we may use its magic to cleanse Ursoc's spirit of its dark taint.12249It is time, .  Take these ashes and look for the furbolg that Kodian spoke of.  If he went to seek Ursoc, he will be near his den, north of Grizzlemaw.You will need his help.  You won't be able to defeat Ursoc alone.Once you've defeated Ursoc, use these ashes to purify his spirit.  Only then will we know whether our efforts have been in vain or not.12250We cannot allow Vordrassil to grow again.  If the furbolg regrew it once, they can do it again.Go to Grizzlemaw, in central Grizzly Hills, and obtain Vordrassil's seeds.  I will make sure they're properly disposed of.12251Return to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at once, . Let him know that your mission was a success and that the few remaining villagers that were rescued are back to work.12252Enough! I want you to put an end to the torture of my people!The Onslaught's torturer, LeCraft, has been bleeding information out of everyone that gets caught by those fiends! I need to know what they know.My sources tell me that he has set up shop in the basement of their barracks, which is right next to the smithy.I'll loan you my personal branding iron to see to it that the job is done right.Find him and get that information.12253Just down this path here is Wintergarde's town square. Once a hive of activity for the citizens of Wintergarde, now a warzone, filled with murderous geists hell-bent on vengeance towards the living.In the buildings surrounding the town square are trapped villagers that must be rescued! I ask much of you, now, , but you are the only soldier I can spare. Free our people. Take this path down into town square and enter those houses. Kill anything that gets in your way! Return to me should you survive.12254These plans indicate something imminent is being planned.But first, there's the matter of this strange protection that the Onslaught forces have. If Venomspite is to deal with them once and for all, we must find out who's behind it and eliminate them.I've noticed that the bishop in the chapel on the far side of New Hearthglen, across from the lumbermill, has stepped up his blessing of the troops. Kill him and steal his prayer book.Maybe it will give us a clue.12255Now that you've captured the flame-imbued talismans and weakened Voldrune's defenses, we can strike at its leader, Thane Torvald Eriksson.The thane's favorite mount is an unruly proto-drake he calls Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the talismans, you should be able to control it long enough to use it against the thane.Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and show him no mercy.12256Even as the Alliance cowards attack our positions, the Dragonflayer vrykul outpost of Voldrune, to the southeast, prepares for war. The vrykul are far from the strongest enemy we face here, but we must eliminate them before they can truly threaten us.Their most powerful warriors are permitted to ride half-trained proto-drakes into battle. To control the beasts, their flamebinders create powerful talismans. You'll need to slay them and take the talismans if our plan is to work.12257Preparations for war are underway in the vrykul village of Voldrune to the southeast. Voldrune's thane cannot field a large army, but with our forces spread thin, we are still at risk.We cannot risk giving the thane and his men an opportunity to attack, so we must take the battle to them. If you are truly a  of the Horde, you will relish the chance to demonstrate our strength.Cut down the huscarls and prove to this Dragonflayer clan that the Horde is not to be trifled with!12258The town square, down this path, is overrun with the undead citizens of Wintergarde! Our own crypt provides a seemingly endless supply of soldiers for the Scourge to throw at us. Take no pity on them, though, . While they were once mortal, capable of compassion and thought, they are now ravaging undead with only one purpose: our destruction.Venture forth to the town square and deliver the vengeful geists to their maker. Give them peace.12259With the flame-imbued talismans, we can finally challenge the thane.His favorite mount is a ferocious proto-drake called Flamebringer. It is kept bound in chains in the western part of Voldrune, but with the power of the talismans, you should be able to bend it to your will and use it against the thane.Once you have Flamebringer under your control, search the tops of the towers of Voldrune for the thane and use Flamebringer to destroy him.12260You may wonder how I can maintain this guise; I use a magic mirror that was loaned to me by the spy mistress.It only has so much power in it, but I think there's enough for the both of us. Here, take it. I want you to use it to impersonate one of the Onslaught raven priests.Be quick about it... I have no idea how long my glamour will last while you have the mirror.Realize that you won't immediately be perfectly disguised, so don't count on it being foolproof until I've had a chance to help you.12261They're drawing power from the bones of my dead brothers...I have no love for the cult, but I'm baffled by their audacity. There will be no mercy shown for them... not that I ever would have anyway.Ensure that they have no place to flee when the slaughter starts. Place a destructive ward at the end of the path leading out of the shrine... where the road starts to give way to snow. Defend it until it is fully charged.12262We will spare no one. Outside, lowly necrolytes and their skeletal servants shame my land with their presence. Slaughter them all.12263The Cult of the Damned has not come just to extract power from dead dragons. I suspect I know what they are up to, but I need you to prove me correct.I will grant you the guise of this dead necrolyte. Proceed to the back of the cave and confirm their intentions for being in this sacred place. I will watch through your eyes. Be cautious , any damage done to you is likely to break the fragile illusion.12264The cave beyond was swarming with Cult atrocities. There is only one way to deal with such creatures... you know what to do.12265I sensed a large accumulation of magic in the runes that we witnessed when you were scouting the cave. I will not have you toy with extracting the magic... often the most straight forward solution is the most effective one.Destroy the runes... stamp them out and ensure that the Cult will not have access to whatever power that they've accumulated there.12266You can leave now, .Go tell Nalice she missed out on a good slaughter.12267With the cult's ranks thinned and some of their power stripped, it's time to strike at the source of the corruption.Rothin the Decaying is resurrecting black dragons as magmawyrms in the back of the cave. Go to the summoning chamber and cleanse the remaining bones in the only way that will ensure that they will never be toyed with again... with flame.Burning the bones will surely gain Rothin's attention, see to it that he is destroyed as well.The magic in this vial should see the task done.12268Ack! This thing's a mess!Goblin engineering leaves a great deal to be desired, believe you me. Just look at this! It's a wonder it ever worked to begin with.Give me a hand, will ya? To get this even close to operable specifications I'll need to replace a few cogs, sprockets, and springs. You should have no trouble finding them down around the sawmill.12269That blasted necropolis blindsided us! In the wake of its destruction Wintergarde Mine was lost. Worse yet, Kel'Thuzad's acolytes have raised the slain miners as Scourge and are using them to supply their siegesmiths with materials from our mine!The supply line must be halted and our lost brothers must be put to rest.Travel to Wintergarde Mine, northeast of here in the Carrion Fields, and destroy the risen miners. Return to me with their miner cards so that I may put their passing in our registry.12270Read my lips,  - I need those shredders! Just as important - I need to keep them out of the hands of the Alliance!They've been refurbishing the shredders and using them against our brothers in Venture Bay. Now we're going to give them a taste of their own medicine!You see a shredder out there, grab it! You see one of the Alliance scum on one, kill 'em and then grab it! Once you have one, drive it back here to me and we'll get to work on it.Dismissed!12271A rod drops from LeCraft's dead hand. There are pulsing magical runes along its length.Could this be how he was getting his confessions?Better let the high executor have a look at it.12272Hours before the Naxxramas invasion, one of the miners stumbled upon a dark ore that was oozing a viscous fluid. In the chaos that occurred during the evacuation of the mine, we lost the samples taken from the alien node. Now the Scourge prospects the ore for use in their machines of death.You must get back to Wintergarde Mine, due northeast of here in the Carrion Fields, and recover the strange ore. It is imperative to our mission's success!12273It's time for us to utterly demoralize the Onslaught forces!I want you to take the rod and use it on four of their leaders: Commander Jordan upstairs at the barracks, Lead Cannoneer Zierhut down the southeast ramp overlooking the beach, Blacksmith Goodman at the smithy, and Stable Master Mercer at the stables.Place them under the rod's compulsion, concentrate on making them denounce the Onslaught, and then kill them!12274We need more information from the high abbot, and now that we have the visage of one of the raven priests, I think we can get you close to talk with him.Unfortunately, we need to separate him from his bodyguards or you'll never get any information out of him.I think I've got it! While in disguise, go to the top of the abbey and ring the bell. That should bring the abbot's bodyguards running and you can then head down to speak with him.12275Quarterflash recently requisitioned my group for a specialist that he could send on a reconnaissance mission to the Wintergarde Mine. To that end, I sent him Slinkin, my demolitionist. I foolishly thought that he could close off that pit of damnation after his mission for Quarterflash was complete, securing another victory for us against the Scourge.An entire day has now passed and Slinkin has not returned. I want answers! Speak with Siege Engineer Quarterflash and track down my missing agent!12276While I have not heard from Slinkin or know what fate has befallen him, perhaps I can assist in finding him.This is not a toy, newfound compatriot. It is, in fact, my latest mechanical creation. The machine was created with the sole purpose of finding that which has been lost. These are unfortunate circumstances, but the machine is your best chance at finding Slinkin.When you are ready to begin your search, place the bot on the ground next to me.12277If there is good in your heart and your conscience is clear, read on.In this mine, near the foreman's scaffold, rests a hefty cargo of dynamite. Go there and pick up several bundles of the explosive and make your way towards the entrance of the mine. Once there, set the dynamite and blow up the entrance. Remember to do this for the upper and lower entry points of Wintergarde Mine.You must leave nothing to chance. The evil that exists here must never be allowed out. Light guide you.12279Thank goodness you're back, Limpy! I worried that Griselda and I were going to be all alone.I'm cooking up some food here for us, but Griselda'll have none of it.She's fond of the fish that live off the coast of the Eastwind Shore, to the east. Can't stand them myself, but she's always been a picky eater. Six good-sized fish ought to keep her happy for a while.Now, run... err... limp along, Joe. Wouldn't want to keep the girl waiting, would ya?12280Twenty shredders by noon tomorrow!Who makes these schedules, anyway? No one who ever put one of these garbage cans back together, that's who....If I'm going to hit my quota, I'll need a hand. Help me out and I'll share my commission with you - fair enough?I need cogs, sprockets and springs. They're littered across the ground down by the shredders.12281We must take solace in the fact that Slinkin's death, while tragic, was for the greater good. His discovery coupled with your heroics in the mine and the samples you returned brings us one step closer to understanding the Scourge war machine.Take this package to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. It holds a sample of the strange ore and my analysis.12282The memories of the past haunt this land, . I hear the cries of the fallen echo across Northrend - calling to me.Arthas left a terrible imprint on everything he touched. Only wither and decay remains in his wake. It is important, then, for us to study the past so that we may better know our enemy. Perhaps untold truths shall surface that could help in our campaign.First, you must recover my scrying orb from the town hall, . Exit this tower and turn left down the path to reach the town square.12283We have to figure out what's going on here. We need the general's diary!I'm pretty sure that you'll find it on her nightstand upstairs at her house. It's the one next to church, across from the stables and the lumbermill.Once you acquire the diary, take it to the high executor back at Venomspite.You'll have to do this the old-fashioned way; the power of the mirror is low and there's only enough left for me.12284We've suffered heavy casualties here, .The only good news is that we've given as much as we've taken. I've requested more troops, but the bulk of our forces are bogged down in Venture Bay. It looks like we're on our own for now.No matter how bad it gets, we MUST stand our ground! The precious resources of this region are essential to the Horde's long-term success in Northrend.We've got to keep the Alliance on their heels until help arrives. Get out there and give 'em something to think about.12285Their attack is imminent, . I need you to get in there and sever the head of the Scarlet Onslaught, literally!It's not going to be easy... Abbendis is sure to be surrounded by a great many of her men.Bring back her head and I'll see to it that you're properly rewarded for saving Venomspite.Fail and don't even bother to return!1228612287I have gazed upon the orb and seen the path that you must walk, .Many years ago an atrocity was committed upon the shores of Dragonblight. The act itself remains shrouded in darkness, but I am certain that your destiny lies south, amidst the ruins of the Forgotten Shore.Take the road southeast through the ravaged town square. Follow the trail until you arrive at Dawn's Reach. You will meet an old friend of mine there known as Orik Trueheart. He will be expecting you.12288You there, ! Help me!We're losing valuable lives! There are simply too many wounded for me to tend to alone. If we can't get our soldiers healed we could be run out of Grizzly Hills altogether!Take this tourniquet and use it on the wounded down on the battlefield.Hurry, ! They're dyyying!!12289It is a dark day for the Alliance. Many good men lay dead or dying here. Our only consolation is that they fought well and brought down many of the enemy with them.With the bulk of our forces committed to Venture Bay we stand alone to weather this storm. The resources in this region are vital to the Alliance and may well make the difference in our struggle against the Horde. We must not fail!Go, . Strike at them while they lick their wounds. Avenge your fallen brothers and keep our hopes alive!12290The spirits of the damned haunt the coast. In life they were brave and noble soldiers of the Alliance, but in death they are cursed - bound to this world until the end of days. We must discover the source of their anguish if we are to free them!To the southeast, on the Eldritch Heights, you will find a rare herb known as murkweed. It is murkweed that I will use to concoct an elixir that will allow you temporary entry into the world of the forgotten. Go now and gather the weed.12291The toxins in the murkweed elixir will render you unconscious. So powerful is the effect of the murkweed that even your spirit will be fooled, allowing you to temporarily enter the world of the dead.Once a spirit, you must speak to the ghostly denizens of the Forgotten Shore. Seek out the cause of their anguish and return to me.Remember, , these spirits were once Alliance soldiers. Treat them with respect, honor and dignity.Now, with elixir in hand, venture south to the Forgotten Shore.12292We've reached a deadlock with the Horde in Grizzly Hills.  Our forces are just about evenly matched and all signs so far have pointed to a stalemate.Until this morning, that is.  The local trappers have requested our help.  Apparently the Horde took something that belongs to them... a relic of some sort.We get this back for them and they'll give us the edge we need.  Head to the Evergreen Trading Post, west of Conquest Hold and look for a cedar chest.12293We have what the trappers want.  Now it's up to us to sign them up with our side.Take the chest to a trapper named Ivan at the Aspen Grove Post, just north of here.If all goes well, we'll have local woodsmen serving as scouts for the king's army in no time.12294Very well, .  Your people kept their end of the bargain.Tell Dumont that we'll honor the deal.12295We'd been trying to negotiate with the trappers for weeks, but we'd gotten nowhere until you found that blasted chest of theirs.This should be good news to our envoy in Silverbrook.  We sent Ducal there about a week ago and his last letter indicated he'd been making little progress.Go to Silverbrook and aid him in his diplomatic efforts.  Take the roads heading northwest of here and you should find it after crossing a couple of bridges.12296Oh, the carnage....I've been through many battles, , and this one was more brutal than any I've seen. Our fight with the Horde has become more intense than ever. It's them or us here in Northrend - life or death.If we are to survive here another day we'll need to mend our wounded. There are too many for me to rescue alone.I've prepared special bandages that will enable you to assist me. Take one and tend to those who have not yet succumbed to their wounds.12297The list I hold must be delivered to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He commands the 7th Legion, stationed at Wintergarde Keep on the eastern borders of the Great Dragonblight.If any of the traitors on this list are stationed at Wintergarde... it could be catastrophic.Hurry, . Show the document to Greer Orehammer here at Westguard Keep and explain the nature of your mission. He'll put you on his fastest gryphon to Wintergarde!12298Skysong will take you to Wintergarde, . I guarantee you that it will be the fastest flight you've ever taken. Go now!12299It's good to meet you.  Let us celebrate our pact by partaking in some good old fashioned Horde-killing.You'll find marauders from Conquest Hold just outside our town, west of here.  Why don't you head out there and hunt them like the filthy animals they are?Let's see if our new allies can back all their talk with some action.12300Alright, friend.  You've done us a favor or two, but that's not the true test of a person's courage.Around these parts, you're not a real hunter unless you wear your prey's skin.The leader of those motherless orcs attacking our town is called Bonesnap; you'll find him at a camp further northwest.That's right.  You're going to skin the monster.12301Zelig gave this crystal ball to me years ago with specific instruction on its use. For five years - whenever I would feel anger, anxiety, or sorrow over the events that transpired here - I was to focus my thoughts upon the orb.I now understand why Zelig gave this crystal to me.Take my crystalline orb to the Forgotten Shore. Find the ruins of my old base on the upper reaches of the beach and place the orb in the center of town. Let the forgotten see the world through my heart and soul.12302Thanks for helping me, .  My name's Sasha.  Listen, I have to get the hell out of here.The people that sent you here... my people... they've changed.  They're not good people anymore... and they want to turn you into one of... one of them.This... 'test' they sent you on is just the beginning.Head to the northwestern end of Silverbrook.  You'll find something of interest to you.Good luck... and trust no one.12303, I need your help; our coffers are empty. The Kor'kron Vanguard at the Wrath Gate has taken all of our coin for the fight there.But, I've heard whispers that there's treasure to be had amongst the wrecks on the Forgotten Shore to the southeast.We have to do something soon, or we won't be able to continue the fight against the Scarlet Onslaught. War isn't cheap, you know!12304It's time for Venomspite to expand!We'll take care of the Onslaught in due time, but I want you to spearhead our efforts on the Forgotten Shore. The property value has outstanding potential and just look at that view!Unfortunately, there's an infestation of human ghosts, shipwrecked crews and the like who haven't quite realized that they're dead.Clear the beach and the waters off the shore, and maybe you and I will talk about building a cozy, new mausoleum down there soon.12305You have honored me and honored the memory of hundreds of Alliance veterans, .

It is a horrible weed... it destroys our farmable crops.We spent all of last week cutting them down, but the roots are beginning to sprout again.It might not seem like an urgent matter, but a resurgence of the plant could be a real... disaster.  Do you think you could help us by uprooting them where you find them near the village?12308You... you're not one of them?  Quick!  Let me out!We have to get to Amberpine Lodge immediately!  Once Lieutenant Dumont finds out who these people really are, this town will be reduced to rubble!12309After the Scourge breached the south wall, I ordered Cavalier Durkon to investigate the town crypt. Moments ago I was handed his report.The undead that plague us are coming from two sources: the ruins of Wintergarde, now a breeding ground for Scourge, and our very own town crypt! Amidst the chaos and confusion the Scourge managed to get a necrolord inside the crypt.In his message, Durkon requested assistance. You will find him and help him, . The crypt is on the western border of the town square.12310Our response must be immediate.  Decisive.  We must teach these savages not to cross us.Our scouts have located what's left of the Silverbrook trappers... you know, the ones you didn't get to douse in flames.  Apparently they're blockading the road to the southeast... perhaps they're trying to box us in.Head to the Forest's Edge post and take care of them.  Their leader's reported to be a man named Vladek... make sure he's dealt with.12311Held within the cold stone walls of this crypt are the remains of the nobles and dignitaries that died in Northrend. At its very core now sits a necrolord who raises the corpses as servants of the Scourge.You must make your way to the bottom of the Wintergarde Crypt and kill Necrolord Amarion. Only then will the assault from within cease!And , be on the lookout for any information that might be laying about inside the room where Amarion resides.12312Scrawled across the flesh-bound chapters of this tome are strange symbols and shapes that seem to have been scraped into the pages with a blade.

The Horde's forces in the port are commanded by Captain Zorna, near the ship on the far side of the bay.If you can defeat her, the Horde's offensive will falter and we can seize the chance to capture the port. Beware, , for Zorna is a fierce fighter. It may take several people to defeat her, or if you have access to a repaired shredder, you might try using it to your advantage.12315With every advance, our men are met by fresh Alliance reinforcements. It's almost as though their commander anticipates my every move!The time has come for good Captain Brightwater to meet his end. He commands his troops from aboard an Alliance destroyer at the far end of the bay.This will be no easy fight, . Take along a couple of trusted friends, or if you have a key to one of those repaired shredders, use it to disembowel Brightwater! Either way, he must fall!12316We cannot permit the Horde to control Venture Bay. The port is essential to our operations in Grizzly Hills and beyond.Captain Stoutmantle has taken the rest of the Westfall Brigade east in search of a passage through the mountains, so we'll have no reinforcements.Go into the field, , and kill the Conquest Hold berserkers the Horde has sent against us. Cut them down until none remain standing. The Alliance must have this port!12317This wretched Westfall Brigade is proving a tougher opponent than we'd thought. Though few in number, they fight well and bravely, but we cannot afford to wait them out.Conqueror Krenna's orders were to capture the port quickly. You must break the stalemate, . Find the enemy's marines and slaughter them until the resistance ceases. Only then will we be able to claim ownership of the port.Go quickly. We don't want to keep Conqueror Krenna waiting.12319What can it be, ? That was certainly no ordinary curse that the blasted lich put on you!I don't even know if I'm looking at it the right way. We must find out what information is held within this tome!The High Commander will know what to do. Take the flesh-bound tome to him and tell him exactly what happened here.12320Take the book and follow the path leading up to the barracks. Once inside the barracks take the staircase down to the prison. At the prison you will find Inquisitor Hallard and our mayor, Godfrey. I believe Godfrey might be the missing piece of this puzzle and Hallard the man to put it all together.Go now!12321Godfrey Goodard, once a righteous man and mayor of Wintergarde, is now an agent of the Scourge. His transformation from man to undying ghoul has taken place slowly, over time. He hears the call of the Lich King now and lives only to serve his master.But as with all Scourge, Godfrey knows the language of death and with proper motivation, will tell us what we need to know about the tome.Once you hear what you need to hear, return to the High Commander at the front lines. I'll clean up here as needed.12323There are still pockets of cowardly Venture Company men holed up in some of the buildings at the center of Venture Bay. I need every man I can spare out there fighting against the Horde, but we can't allow those Venture Company stragglers to camp out in those buildings, either.Maybe we can \"convince\" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables. Don't get too close, though; they probably bite.12324Not only is this port infested with sniveling Alliance cowards, but to make matters worse, there are still Venture Company employees holed up in some of the buildings. They're not worth the time it takes to kill and I can't spare the warriors anyway.Maybe we can \"convince\" them to make for their ship. Take this smoke bomb and use it to smoke out the stragglers from their places in the bunkhouse, sawmill, or stables.

Slaughter them before they have the chance to do so.12413A few hours ago, the trappers were nothing but peasants threatening to add their number to the Alliance's.Now they've become something else... an uncertainty.  I do not like uncertainties.  Go to the hills outside their main town in northern Grizzly Hills, Silverbrook, and help my men crush them.12414Cap'n Stoutmantle left most of our calvary... cavlary... uh, horsemen at the fight for Venture Bay.We chose a good place to put the camp 'cause there are tons of highland mustangs running around near here and in the Boulder Hills to the northeast. The Cap'n put me in charge of capturing some of 'em.Will you help? I've got a stick and some string, and there are loads of wild carrots growing near the camp. Pick the carrots and use them with the stick to lure in the mustang, then ride it back here.12415The Alliance's 'Westfall Brigade' is camped far to the north, near Thor Modan. They have foolishly divided their forces to contest our control of Venture Bay, and they have been left without cavalry.They're now trying to capture and tame the wild highland mustangs that roam the area around the Westfall Brigade Encampment and Boulder Hills. We must stop them before they're able to replace their lost mounts. Take this and throw it near the horses to drive them away.12416The Scourge have overrun the shrine. The shrine's keeper, Dahlia Suntouch, is nowhere to be found. The red wyrms that fell in the shrine's defense now beset us in the form of twisted skeletal emberwyrms.

I have brothers who are falling in the battle overhead and if we do not act quickly, they will only bolster the emberwyrm ranks.Get into the shrine through one of the other passes to the south or north... the Scourge presence should be lighter there.Search the shrine for ruby acorns that have fallen from the tree and plant them near the bodies of my fallen brood. Through this, they can give new life... a proud fate for any of my kind.12418I have one final task for you, ... one that should turn the tide of this fight.Return to the shrine and kill the necromancers that are fueling this onslaught. With them dead, we should be able to beat these forces back and eventually retake the shrine.I also need you to find the source of the corruption under the shrine and put an end to it.I know I have asked a lot of you, but if you do this for me, we will win this battle.12419As you pick up the brooch, its faint glow brightens slightly.Krasus will want to know of Dahlia's fate.

I need you to act with discretion and speed.One of Krenna's top sergeants has captured a trapper outcast outside of Silverbrook.  Now, if things turn out the way they usually do, the prisoner is going to be executed before the day is over.We can't let that happen.  You see, the prisoner matches the description of Mikhail's older daughter in his diary.If we set her loose and follow her closely, she'll lead us to whoever's controlling the trappers.  Take this letter to her.12423From what you can gather, this journal was written by a denizen of Silverbrook named Mikhail.It is written in some variant of the common human tongue.  Perhaps you should bring this back to Conqueror Krenna.12424This book is written in the pig-tongue the humans use.  It needs to be burned immediately.Hand it to my sister Gorgonna and do not waste my time.12425This trapper business has the potential to be more important than we've accounted for.If they're not with the Alliance, there's a good chance they're with the Scourge, which could mean trouble.Our previous efforts might've paid off, though.  We spotted our former captive meeting with a fortune teller of some sort before we lost track of her.I'm almost certain now that she will take us to their leader if we can find her again.  Find Ruuna the Blind and see what you can find out.12427So you're interested in the fights, eh?  Well, Krenna has outlawed pit-fighting for all enlisted combatants.  But you, my friend, are technically a free agent and are not included in this prohibition.Nice loophole, eh?Anyway, if you're interested I can start you off with something easy, a measly bear.  I'll even let you bring friends along!12428You're not bad.  Not bad at all.Think you can take a furbolg?  What about one of those extra-large crazed Northrend furbolgs?Good, good.

Why don't you go hunt down some stag and bring me the venison?They're numerous in the area, so bring me only the best meat.12437Listen, . This battle is as much over resources as tactical supremacy.I have a mission that could turn the tide in our struggle against the Horde here.There are torpedoes at the end of the dock that we can use to take down the Horde's lumber ship to the northwest.You'll need to get some of the fuel that's stored on the docked goblin ship just north of here, then ride one of the torpedoes into their transport!12438Posted by: Illusia LuneThe Scourge flesh giant known as Kreug Oathbreaker was responsible for the deaths of my husband, children and my dear friends, the Whisperveils.

Join them and crush the Scourge beneath your boots!For the Horde!12462Just down the steps lies the gateway to damnation: Scourge as far as the eye can see and getting thicker with each passing moment. What little intelligence we've been able to gather indicates that two Scourge necrolords are furiously working at emptying the first two crypts down below. Before we can breach the inner chamber to Thel'zan, we'll need to take care of those two clowns and their Naxxramas cronies.Go down into the mausoleum and take out the necrolords and the Naxxramas dreadguards and shades.12463There's been talk of a tunnel dug by Scourge that connects the embalming chambers of the mausoleum with the large crypts, now unearthed by Thel'zan and his minions. I recently sent my best rogue, Plunderbeard, in search of answers, but have yet to hear back from him. If I were a betting man I'd wager that he's a goner.I want you to go down those steps and head straight through the embalming chamber and look for Plunderbeard. Dead or alive, he'll have answers.12464My old enemy, High General Abbendis, has come to Northrend.Somehow she survived the attacks upon Tyr's Hand and brought a small force north. They've established New Hearthglen to the south.While they could prove useful in fighting the Scourge, Abbendis herself is far too shrewd an opponent to let live. Trust me, if we let them stand, she will be at our throats before the dust settles.So, we'll deprive them of their leadership and go about our business. Bring me her head as proof.12465Whatever was written on the remaining pages of Plunderbeard's journal must be recovered. Search the chambers located on the other side of this tunnel for Plunderbeard's assailants. They must be the ones who tore the journal apart!Should you recover the missing pages, return them to Ambo Cash at the entrance of the Wintergarde Mausoleum.12466You need to get to the 7th Legion Front in northern Dragonblight. Return to Wintergarde Keep and take the north gate out of town. Keep north until you hit a road. Take a left on that road and follow it until you reach the snowline. Once at the snowline keep heading west until you hit the Path of the Titans. Follow that north and it'll lead you right into the 7th Legion Front.Once there, speak with Legion Commander Tyralion. He'll be expecting you.And  - it has been a pleasure. Farewell.12467Your frostwyrm is out there.And it's a big one!When you're ready to fight, go speak with \"Wyrmbait.\" He'll \"fetch\" her. Once Icestorm is close enough we'll chain her to the ground and finish her off! Hopefully, with your help, we'll be able to take her down and get you that phylactery.Once you've got the phylactery, return to Wintergarde Keep and report to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane. He's been making preparations for the final showdown with Thel'zan.12468The Horde is a magnificent war machine and you are nothing but a cog.I am in charge of securing fuel for this machine.

The harpy feathers half-buried in the snow nearby suggest how he met his ill fate.It appears that the goblin was bringing the explosives towards the Wrath Gate from somewhere to the east. It seems most prudent to follow the ridge back to the east and inform the sender of their runner's fate.12470A time storm at the Bronze Dragonshrine to the northeast is keeping immortals from entering.The Infinite Dragonflight are in a fight inside with the defenders to wrest control of the dragonshrine.

The only piece that's missing now is you.Take the phylactery and report to Legion Commander Yorik inside the Wintergarde Mausoleum.There is a tunnel that the Scourge dug out just outside the keep that you can take to get to Yorik quickly. Go now, ! Lead us to victory!12473Every good story has a beginning and an ending, . While your story is far from over, I'll be damned if it's not already turning out to be the stuff of legend! No matter what happens to us when this is all over, what you've done at Wintergarde will be a tale told for years to come.Now, ally, when you are ready I will use the phylactery to coax Thel'zan out of hiding.Should we somehow succeed, report the victory to High Commander Halford Wyrmbane at Wintergarde Keep.12474With the Naxxramas war machine stopped dead in its tracks the time has come for you to help our forces at Angrathar, the Wrathgate.

Go now, !Take the north gate out of town and travel north by northwest until you arrive at your destination.Light protect you!12475After the betrayal at the Forgotten Shore, Prince Arthas - with Muradin in tow - began his quest for Frostmourne. Could the location of the cavern where Frostmourne was found be near? What secrets could it hold? While the orb has no answers for these questions, it does show me something.To the northeast of Wintergarde Keep is an outpost built by the Scarlet Onslaught. Somewhere within that outpost is a map. The orb tells me that this map will be of great use to us.Retrieve it!12476To the northeast of Wintergarde Keep is a newly built encampment, set up by the Scarlet Crusade - or rather - the Scarlet Onslaught as they now call themselves. While we are unsure as to why they are in Northrend, they are certainly no less dangerous than they were before. As of last night the Scarlet Onslaught has killed twelve of our soldiers. They must be taught a lesson, .Go to Onslaught Base Camp and thin them out.12477\"The Path of Redemption,\" ever heard of it? It is allegedly a journal that holds the prophetic ramblings of High General Abbendis of the Scarlet Onslaught. Within that book can be found the motivations and goals of the Scarlet zealots - not to mention a whole lot of insanity.Venture to Onslaught Base Camp, northeast of Wintergarde Keep, and recover a copy of \"The Path of Redemption\" from one of the Onslaught soldiers.12478They have labeled the cave as Frostmourne Cavern. Why the Scarlet Onslaught is interested in such things is unknown, but by the look of things, the area surrounding the cave is heavily guarded. Nonetheless, we must proceed!Take this scrying orb and travel north out of town and then northwest towards Scarlet Point. Make your way into the cave and battle your way to the bottom. Once there, use the orb. Return here with what you discover.12481The vrykul are being clever about this.  Fortunately I've a trick up my sleeve.This leader of theirs, Bjorn, is a real hothead.  We've pieced together enough of their language to fashion what we think is a good insult.  Something involving his mother and large barnyard animals... we're not quite sure.Take this piece of paper and read it to him.  Once he starts chasing you, lure him back here.  We'll make sure he doesn't make it out alive.12482We await reinforcements from Vengeance Landing to move against Nifflevar.  If we were to capture it earlier, though, it would provide us with a great advantage over the Alliance.Head into town and see if you can put a dent in their numbers.12483Say, while yer here, how bout ya help ol' Prigmon with a little chore?

I just sensed it.He had a pupil that he took with him when he went north. They were going to help the overlord establish an outpost on the edge of Sholazar Basin.Her name is Snarlfang. She is a spirit talker.Perhaps she will know what happened. Or, at least, she can help you to find out.12487I've received a request for help from our base in the Grizzly Hills.

From overhead they send their frost wyrms to strafe the field of battle, making an advance upon the gate itself impossible. The frost wyrm attacks must be stopped, but before we defile the bones of ancient dragons, we must gain permission from their queen.Travel southeast to Wyrmrest Temple and seek out Queen Alexstrasza. Tell her what we must do and ask her for guidance.Go now, !12496Though I know you hunger to destroy the Scourge that stand before us at the Wrath Gate, we must first deal with the threat that looms overhead. Until the strafing assaults of the frost wyrms are halted, we cannot move forward.But before we assault the dying grounds of dragons, we must first be granted permission. Venture now to the hallowed halls of dragonkind: Wyrmrest Temple. Once there, seek out Queen Alexstrasza.Ride now, !

Our men will fight to the end and never complain no matter what the conditions.That said, we've taken some heavy casualties in this campaign and we've been hitting it hard with little or no sleep for months. That all takes a toll on morale, whether we admit it or not.It may not seem like much, but seeing our standard raised over the battlefield is of considerable comfort to a soldier. Take these banners and raise them at the pedestals in Drak'Sotra.12503Despite our substantial successes in the lower third of Zul'Drak, we must still face the onslaught of the Scourge. Such is the way in this frigid hell.The attacks are unrelenting, yet my men need rest. If you are willing, we could use your aid in reinforcing them.Below in the courtyard you'll find no end to the fighting. Dispatch the Scourge there with all the zeal you can muster, .12504Look, , I'd love to just up and leave, but take a look out there. All of my people are fighting.Tell you what, you've come this far, you think you're up to doing me a small favor? Head out there and round up my soldiers?Tell 'em that the sergeant orders them to report back immediately. Lend them a hand if you will.12505, you're here to help, right? I've got new orders for our forces that are currently deployed at the Drakkari altar to the north.You can't miss it. Just head straight up the avenue. Sergeant Stackhammer shouldn't be hard to find.12506There's trouble at the altar of the snake god.The presence of the Scourge has weakened the land, . This in turn has weakened the wild gods.We know that the Drakkari are taking advantage of this to do evil things to the gods.I need you to be my eyes and ears. The Altar of Sseratus is at the end of the avenue to the north. Sneak around the back and get a look inside of the main altar building.Whatever you do, avoid the prophet at all costs!12507This bottle of strange mojo may be the key to what is truly going on here.The Zandalari troll Hexxer Ubungo, back at The Argent Stand, may want to take a look at it.12508I couldn't help but overhear what you were talking to the sergeant about. That doesn't change the fact that we still have a job to do here.While you're out there, do you think you could help us to put some of those followers of Sseratus out of their misery?12509Finally, the patrol arrives!Here's the situation, . We've lost many of our finest soldiers in this campaign and have had to call upon our recruits to fill in the gaps.We've just fought one of our fiercest battles and many of the recruits were simply not prepared to face this enemy. There are more fights ahead, and I need them ready to follow orders.If there's one thing I can't stomach, it's cowardice. Perhaps you can help them find the courage to continue.12510I have an idea for how to deal with the prophet of Sseratus. But first, we're going to need some things.The Drak'Sotra Fields are directly to the south. Because of the stresses on the land from the Scourge and the deaths of gods, the wall between worlds has weakened and the elementals are flooding in.We need the precious fluids of their lords. If you combine three links from the elementals a tether will be made, and one of their lords can be summoned.12511While we focus to hold our ground at Wintergarde and deal with the unfolding events of the Wrathgate, battalions from as far away as Westfall battle their way through the dense foliage and inhospitable denizens of Grizzly Hills. All in hopes of finding an alternate route into Icecrown.Lieutenant Dumont, stationed at Amberpine Lodge, has enlisted the aid of able bodied citizens willing to risk life and limb in the uncharted wilds. Will you rise to meet this challenge?12512Ahh, good. They sent someone.Listen, . We need a hand here. Our forces were pushed back and we've lost Drak'Sotra to the Scourge. Where they came from is anyone's guess....The point is, we need every man we can get here, and some of our best have yet to return from battle.I need you to enter the ruins now that the fighting has died down and find our wounded, patch them up, and bring them here to me.Scour Drak'Sotra! They couldn't have gone far.12513My hat? Yes, it's an unusual style, I know, from far away... few tailors here know how to make them.When I was young and hot-blooded, I wore it as a standing challenge. Many came seeking to defeat me and win it for themselves... but no one ever did.Ah, but those days are long past. I'm an old man, now: I drink, I fish, but I no longer duel.12514Now what we need is something to spike the mojo with. Something that'll make it so that when the prophet drinks it, he'll become less powerful.Drak'Agal lies to the east. There's a mushroom there that the natives call muddlecap fungus. I think it's exactly what we need.Bring back lots of them. When we mix them into the mojo, the mind of anyone who drinks it will become muddled.12516There. I've modified the mojo. Now when the prophet drinks it, not only will he lose some of his power, his mind will also be addled by the effects of the fungus.At least that's the theory.As for how to get him to drink it, might I suggest you simply throw it at him? No doubt he'll catch and drink it given the arrogance that he's displayed at the altar.Unless you can kill him, , your Argent Crusade is about to come to a terrible end.12517Now that you have gathered all of the Rogue cards together into a deck, another card appears on top.  It depicts a fortune teller that seems to stare at you no matter how you hold the card.You feel the card could be used to communicate with someone or something.12518Now that you have gathered all of the Mage cards together into a deck, another card appears on top.

That'll hafta be close enough.12520No rough landing is going to stop ol' Hemet from mastering the largest game Sholazar has to offer. In the wilds northwest of the camp, the jungles are ruled by the mighty shardhorn rhino. You can prove your worth to the expedition, , by showing me that you're tough enough to face down those powerful beasts.12521When I heard that the legendary Hemet Nesingwary was setting sail for the Sholazar Basin, I offered to help fund his expedition. We know little of Sholazar,  but it's said to be a lush paradise in the midst of this frozen continent.Hemet has agreed to send back samples of exotic plants, reagents, and crystals. There hasn't been any word from him. Monte Muzzleshot was supposed to be bringing them supplies, but he hasn't returned, either. If you'll look into it, I'll send you in my flying machine.12522She's ruined... ruined! I told that captain to be careful with such a precious cargo, but would she listen to me? No!When the ship ran aground, it damaged my flying machine, the Spirit of Gnomeregan. Now, we're left without any means to send our reports!There is a chance, though, that the Venture Company's antics may work in our favor. They shot down another flying machine right about where Monte parachuted into the swamp to the east. Go there and retrieve the engine. It may be our only hope.12523Great, now that we've got an engine, we're going to need an assortment of other parts to get her back in flying condition. Don't worry, I know what I'm doing.A good mechanic can hold his creations together with anything, but we're better off if it doesn't come to that.Anyway, those Venture Company dullards have plenty of spare parts for their mining equipment all over Swindlegrin's Dig on the far side of that yellow crystal pillar to the northeast. Scoop up a few and bring them back here.12524Ever since we arrived, the Venture Company has hampered our efforts to secure our campsite and survey the area. Normally, we wouldn't care what they were up to, but they've started antagonizing our scouts and shooting down supply flights.We can't allow this insult to stand. Hemet Nesingwary's expedition came here to hunt, and hunt it shall.Go to Swindlegrin's Dig, on the far side of the crystal pillar to the northeast, and kill any Venture Company employee you see!12525We must send Foreman Swindlegrin packing if we're going to shut down his mine permanently, but be careful. His bodyguard, Meatpie, is a large, mean ogre, and  isn't likely to let you see the foreman without a fight.The two probably occupy a platform that would let them look out over the entire Venture Company operation at Swindlegrin's Dig.Remember, the dig is on the far side of the Suntouched Pillar to the northeast. Good luck, .12526Well, that's settled then. We'll seek out this native sage and have a word with him. He's not likely to volunteer his services, though.I'm told he keeps a small lean-to near the Bones of Nozronn, just across the river to the south. Seek him out, introduce yourself, and ask what he requires to help us track down this patriarch of the rhinos.12527My master, Finklestein, is in the shrine at Heb'Valok to the northwest preparing a truth serum, and he needs basilisk crystals. Heb'Valok is on the west side of the road leading north before the Altar of Sseratus.There are basilisks to the east at Drak'Agal.If you grab the Zul'Drak rats and throw them at the basilisk, they will become gorged and docile after eating five. Then you'll be able to take their crystals.Killing the basilisk won't do you any good. That'd just break its crystals!12528My kill! You take my kill!You dumb, . Now you owe Gekgek!

Go with Dajik to Sapphire Hive to southeast or to river in south and learn the hunt.12534Bristlepine can be dangerous, but most stay far away from wolvar. Wasps on other hand not fear the Frenzyheart... they even kill some of our hunters.I know Rakjak want wasp queen dead, but no wolvar want to go into her hive. You go kill wasp queen in Sapphire Hive to southeast and get stinger for Rakjak. Me bet Rakjak like that.12535You good hunter, but Frenzyheart can make you stronger.

I haven't seen any evidence of this Shango's existence, but my injuries have kept me from venturing outside the camp.If you fancy yourself something of a tracker, you might be able to find out the truth about Shango. Debaar said she saw some large tracks on her last outing. Go north from the camp toward Bittertide Lake, and search its southern shore for the prints.12551I warn you, stranger -- do not make any comments about crashing the ship. I already get enough of it from the rest of the expedition.If you're looking to try your hand at hunting, though, you should test your skills against the wily mangal crocolisks. They live all along the river to the south, and in the Wildgrowth Mangal to the east. Prove you can hold your own against them and we'll talk again, hunter.12552When the trolls brought down Kolramas, it crashed next to us to the southeast. Unfortunately the crash did not destroy all of the Scourge within.Now they're raising our men from the dead and using them against us!This will not be allowed to continue. You will see to it that their necromagi are slaughtered! Do we understand each other?12553Why do I always get the tough tasks to tackle?The Scourge at Kolramas have plague sprayers that are getting dangerously close. You don't want to know what's going to happen if they start heading this way!I've got an idea for how we might bring them down, but first we're going to need something... something from their own creatures.The Hath'ar skimmers can spin a very strong web that we can put to good use. Bring back some of their spinnerets.12554, head back down there!You'll find the leader of Kolramas, Malas the Corrupter, gloating from atop the crashed necropolis.Kill him and bring me his head!12555There! One tangled skein thrower ready and waiting for you to take those plague sprayers down.You just aim and let loose. The webbing should foul up their hover spells long enough to cause them to crash to the ground just like Kolramas.Kind of poetic. I like that!12556Now that we know where to find Farunn, all that remains is the battle against the great beast. Are you ready to take on this rhino, ? For all the spirit's blustering, I'm certain it was telling the truth about the beast's strength.When you're ready to face him, head north past the Suntouched Pillar and look for Farunn on the northeast shore of the Bittertide Lake. It may even venture near the Glimmering Pillar. Bring back its horn to commemorate your kill.12557I assume by your interruption that you wish to be numbered among those I am considering for apprenticeship.A worthy aspiration...Should I someday choose to accept your petition, I must be confident that you can find your way around my laboratory.

Find a muddy mire maggot, a withered batwing, an amberseed, and some chilled serpent mucus.Succeed, and I'll know to take your request seriously.12558Shango awaits, . If you have succeeded in your tracking, he will not know that you stalk him, and you will need the advantage.He is supposed to be bigger, stronger, and more ferocious than the other dreadsabers of the basin. Travel north, to the western shore of Bittertide Lake and near the falls that feed it, do battle with Shango. If you succeed, return with his pelt.12559It is time then.  Let us activate the waygate.You will find the first switch inside the Makers' Perch in the western edge of the basin.Beware, .  The titans used the perch to watch over their creations.  Many of their stone servants still guard the place.12560The mangal crocolisk is a master of the ambush, and I intend to beat the best at his game. To do that, we'll need to construct a convincing camouflage for you. We'll use plants that grow in the sandy soil of the riverbanks and lake beaches.The sandfern is best for this purpose. It grows in the sandy areas near the shores of the Seabreach Flow, just to the south, Bittertide Lake and Bittertide Falls, to the north, and the edges of River's Heart, the large lake beyond the mangal to the east.12561This should never have happened.

Head south when you're ready.12564Gritty as my men are, they're still mortal.Wounds and pain diminish their ability to perform their missions. No amount of training changes that simple fact of life.Thankfully, one of our alchemists has developed a recipe for a salve that binds to our bandages and greatly reduces the pain our soldiers experience.The salve requires a special poppy these trolls cultivate just west of here. Go to Drak'Sotra Fields and harvest some of them to keep our stockpiles from running out.12565I am heartened to see the zeal with which your Argent Crusade is dealing with the Scourge, .

Nevertheless, it is our solemn duty to ensure that our brethren never walk with the Scourge.Pour this oil on the corpses of our fallen to ensure that we never face them on the battlefield as enemies.12569The largest crocolisk in the basin, known around here as \"Bushwhacker\" for his ambush prowess, likes to sun himself in the shallow waters of River's Heart. It's the large lake at the basin's center, and is to the east of our camp.I want you to take the camouflage I've prepared and hide on the western beach of River's Heart and ambush Bushwhacker when he shows himself.

Now they mess with sacred shrines though. Sacred shrines not for messing with.

He extra smart Rainspeaker... you listen to him good-like.12579I've always suspected that the pillars have been the main reason for our weather and seclusion from the undead... this confirms it a bit.Not terribly long ago, there was a sound of a great explosion when the Lifeblood Pillar fell. The weather changed for the mosswalkers almost immediately... it began to snow, something we never see.They were able to stop the snow by bringing more lifeblood crystals to the Great Moss Stone. Perhaps if we can do the same, it will help ward off the undead as well.12580There's some small chance that the Mosswalkers are not all dead yet... and at the very least, they deserve to not be butchered like this.Let's find some revenge for this slaughter and see if there are any to be saved in the process.12581Perhaps the crystals will ward off the undead gradually, but there is one more thing that must be done.We need to find the leader of these undead and kill him to ensure there's no one to push the wretches back upon us. If my suspicions are correct, he will be somewhere inside the fallen pillar... the Sundered Shard.The corpses being dragged there would suggest as much anyway.I'll place the shards and bring the news to Soo-say... I'll leave the rest up to you.1258212583I know that one of those plague sprayers crashed somewhere within Drak'Sotra to the west of us.Why don't you see if you can find it.

Now, this isn't something you can win in the blink of an eye, and you'll find yourself killing many different kinds of creatures. Good luck!12593All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the Scourge.Gaze now upon the lands below us.

They must all be shown the price of their defiance.You will become my force of retribution. Where you tread, doom will follow. Go now and claim your destiny, death knight.12594Of all the posts, they throw me in this one.The place is flooded with putrid, stagnant water and now it's host to sewage elementals!I don't really know what they are or why they're here, and frankly I couldn't care less. What I do know is they're making a mess of my sector! How am I supposed to conduct any dignified military operations with those foul things roaming around?Get out there, , and don't come back 'til you've cleared your share of 'em off of my battlefield!12595Well, , you've certainly proven your mettle as a hunter of all kinds of game animals -- rhinos, cats, and crocolisks. For some members of the expedition, these creatures are sufficient to test their hunting skills, but others, like myself, crave larger challenges.Dorian Drakestalker went north, across Bittertide Lake and established a camp there.

The Lich King commands it!12642My feelings tell me that Rhunok doesn't have much time.I can tell that the arctic bear god's spirit has already separated from his weakened body. It is his spirit with which you must commune.His altar lies to the northwest beyond Drak'Mabwa.12643Once the Scourge have a target in their sights, they'll stop at nothing to acquire it.You're doomed to a mindless existence as a walking corpse....... unless we can use their desires against them.I'll explain later. I have complex magic to prepare which requires certain material components.Travel due east of here to the land beneath the Reliquary of Agony. Slay the ghouls and abominations you'll find there and return to me with their remnants.12644Now that we've got the raw materials, I've had my assistant ready the still. He'll oversee the process, but I want you to help keep everything under control. You might be tempted to think that we just throw everything into the still and let it sit, but you're wrong.Ingredients and heat need to be added at certain times, and the pressure regulated at others. You'll have no more than 10 seconds to react to a situation. Speak with \"Tipsy\" McManus when you're ready to start distilling.12645And now for the moment of truth!I've always wanted to say that. Normally, I'd debut a new drink at a banquet, but we can't have one in the middle of the jungle.Instead, just take samples to a few trusted friends and return with their comments. Let's see, we'll definitely want Hemet Nesingwary's opinion, and Hadrius Harlowe's, too. They're here in camp. You'll want to head over to Lakeside Landing, near the center of the Basin and offer Tamara Wobblesprocket a taste.12646My prophet absorbed too much of my power too quickly, and subsequently killed himself. You can see the results at the water-filled crater to the south in Drak'Mabwa.My former priests have already resurrected him so that he can finish the job. They're channeling my power back into him, and it will not be long now before he reawakens.You must put an end to him and return with my mojo before it is too late.12647My body is too far gone now, . It is only a matter of time before a new prophet is elevated and finishes what the other began.I am going to imbue you with the last of my power. The tormentor inside the altar building carries incense, which will awaken my body and make it vulnerable.Use the incense and do me the kindness of putting an end to my suffering.I apologize if I fight back. Even for me, the will to survive is strong.12648There... I've created a disguise that should make you indistinguishable from the Scourge.You'll be free to walk among them as long as the disguise holds. Only the blightguards will be able to see through my illusion. Watch out for them!Another thing you must know is that the disguise is unstable and may drop unexpectedly, so stay alert.Let's test it out. Use the choker and visit the Scourge merchant just east of here. Return to me with a bottle of bitter plasma.12649There...

I asked them to setup a small camp there so that we could use them as a relay to fly in supplies and survey the area.They should have arrived by now and started setting up. River's Heart is near the center of the basin where the rivers converge. Search for Lakeshore Landing on the northeast shore. Marvin mentioned it would be the best spot.12652Git o'er heer, gool!

Somehow I sense that she has other plans for you.Tell her that no matter what, we are eternal.12654When Hemet asked me to accompany Marvin out here, I hoped that I might have the opportunity to work on my own hunting skills in between repairing the flying machines and setting up the camp.I wanted to take down a ferocious lion named Pitch. He's said to make his home south of here, near where the Wildgrowth Mangal meets the northern face of the Skyreach Pillar. If you can find the beast, would you bring back his remains? If the rumors are true, they'd make a trophy even Hemet will respect!12655There is another god of Zul'Drak that is being neglected.Zim'Rhuk's statue lies directly to the north. Known as \"The Wise One\", Zim'Rhuk is also known to be very protective of his domain. He maintains guardians that deal harshly with anyone that does not have the wits to slip past them.Avoid the guardians and give the Drakkari offerings to Zim'Rhuk so that you will benefit from his blessing.1265612657Listen well, death knight, for I give to you the words that will start a war. My final judgment has been passed: Death. To. All. None shall stand so boldly against the might of the Scourge without reprisal!As you have served me well in your first task, so too shall you serve me in your next task. Take my judgment to Highlord Mograine at the command post of Acherus, found on the first floor. Tell him to begin the assault.And when the Crusade has been dealt with, we will finish off the Argent Dawn.12658Dorian's had me training and feeding the baby drakes he captures, and it has gotten me thinking. I want a pet of my own!No, not a juvenile drake. I don't want a pet capable of biting my hand off!However, in the Bonefields to the northeast of the camp, beyond the area dominated by the drakes, there's a large population of goretalon rocs. The grown ones are beyond hope of domesticating, but if you bring me the eggs from their nests, I can raise them from the time they hatch.12659I thinkin' it be time to do some scalpin', mon!The trolls at Heb'Drakkar to the northeast should do nicely. With their fancy bats and attackin' us, they got it comin'!Ahunae even give you his own knife so that you do the job right.12660The Lich King's lackeys have dared to bring weapons of destruction into my domain.  I will not stand for this.Go to their outpost to the north and destroy the weapons they would use against the land.  We cannot let the Scourge taint another inch of these sacred lands.12661By now you've probably guessed the details of my plan.We're using the Scourge's interest in you against them. You're going undercover. I know it's likely a death sentence, but if we do nothing your death is a certainty.Travel northeast to Reliquary of Pain and stand on the platform while wearing your disguise. Once inside Voltarus, you must earn the trust of the Scourge commander.When you've completed your mission, blow this horn and I'll fly to your location to receive your report.12662You want to really deal with Heb'Drakkar? Collecting scalps isn't going to get the job done. You have to take out their leader, Heb'Jin.The problem is, he's up on the bat rookery goading his forces on.Bang his drum and I guarantee that he'll fly down. That's when you kill him.You can take this net we got from one of his headhunters. Use it to trap his bat when he lands. That way you won't have to fight both of them.12663!Ya musta received mah gift! Turn around, mon, lemme get a good look at ya... Ahh, ya make me proud.We come such a long way, you and I, and now we be servin' da Lich King together.Stick with me and big things be comin, mon.

What it is exactly I cannot sense, but I do know that her altar has been overrun with powerful creatures.I'm going to send you there on the back of one of my children, which you saved. The two of you will move swiftly and with great stealth to uncover what has become of Quetz'lun.My child will see you safely back to me. Just keep your eyes open.When you are ready, ask and I will call one of my kittens for you.12666Quetz'lun may be dead, but I can still feel her spirit lingering in the underworld at the altar. We have to find a way to get you to her.Luckily for us, I just happen to have a supply of former supplicants at hand who are no longer in need of their sacred adornments. Both my subduers and claws are likely to still be wearing them.Bring the adornments to me and I'll draw upon their energy to enable you to cross over into Quetz'lun's underworld nightmare.12667You are prepared, but I'm not certain that you're ready for what is to come.When you cross back over into Quetz'lun's altar area, you will enter the realm of the dead. From what I can feel of it, it's not going to be pleasant.Try not to be distracted by what you see in there. Simply head for the altar building and seek out Quetz'lun's Spirit.12668I have something special planned for my favorite high priests. But first you get to prove yourself in laying the foundation for my revenge.You do still want to live, yes?As you have seen, my devotees are enjoying their stay here, but now it's time for them to make final restitution.Do me the smallest of favors if you would, . Lure them near my soul fonts and then put an end to their existences.They taste so delicious, and their sacrifice will not go in vain, I can assure you.12669Everything you've reported is consistent with what we know. Learning of Drakuru and earning his trust will lay the groundwork for your future missions.Return to him and do as he says. Do whatever you must to appear sincere, . A great deal is riding upon your performance.This time I'm adding an additional assignment: While you're in the field, pour this additive into their blight cauldrons. It should neutralize the scourging agent and render the batch useless.12670Below Acherus stands Death's Breach, the staging point for our assault upon the Scarlet Crusade. You are to ride one of my Scourge gryphons, located on either side of this platform, and report to Prince Valanar. Do as he says and you may live to see these lands fall before us.12671It's about time we had planes up and running in this place.  The professor's been asking me to check out a strange weather pattern coming from the northeast.Thing is, I'm going to need a co-pilot if we're going into uncharted territory.  No way in hell I'm heading out there alone.What do you say, ?  You might learn a thing or two.  And once you learn to deal with the northern winds... you can pretty much fly anywhere.12672I will give you a chance at continued existence.There are fragments of the power that fueled my curse scattered about the altar grounds. It is my desire that you collect some of them for me. Not so many that the curse will be lifted, but enough that I will be able to eventually make use of them to exact revenge upon my prophet.Go, insect. Run and do my bidding before I change my mind about letting you live.12673If ya ever gonna be worthy of da Lich King's gifts, ya must learn ta be a great leader - one who be commandin' respect!I got a task dat gonna refine your command skills, mon....Summa my minions be trained ta harvest blight crystals from da land below, but dey be lazy and slow. You gonna be in charge o' dem, mon.Take dis scepter and teach 'em how to get da job done. When dey be under your control, make 'em harvest dem crystals!12674It is now time for you to punish my three high priests: Mu'funu, Tua-Tua, and Hawinni. You'll find them spread around the altar grounds.Take this hexxing stick. I've empowered it with my rage and indignation. I'm sure that it will prove potent.Just use it and proceed to destroy them. The hex will take care of the rest.Succeed and I may let you go. Fail and die.12675There is one last thing that is needed to enact the final revenge against my prophet. The power fragments you collected must be imbued with a portion of a living gods' spirit. You're going to need to beseech Har'koa for some of hers.Once you've done that, when you return here, you will not come to the underworld. Instead, you will return to the physical world of my altar. My children and guardians will no longer attack you, and you'll be able to get to my prophet without having to worry about them.12676While we're working to discover the purpose of these crystals, we need you back in Voltarus doing Drakuru's bidding.Every task you perform successfully gets you closer to him, and brings us that much nearer to knowing his mind.While you're there, I have another mission for you. Drakuru's Scourgewagons pose a significant threat. We need them destroyed. Make your way to the wagons and activate these charges. Once they're set, get clear! The explosion will expose you if you're too close.12677Blight crystals?! What could this scumbag Drakuru be up to? Clearly, he's working on something significant.Continue to do his bidding and perhaps once he's more familiar with you he'll reveal his plans. In the meantime, we need to have a look at these crystals.While you're in Voltarus, try to get some samples of the harvested crystals when no one's looking.Be alert! Handling those crystals can trigger your disguise to fail.12678They make their stand now, outside of Death's Breach, futilely attempting to push us back in hopes of saving their horses, mines, lumber and citizens.This will be your first lesson in Scourge warfare: TERROR!Go to the front lines, south of here, and destroy Scarlet Crusaders. Leave their corpses so that we may utilize them for the death march.But most importantly: kill the fleeing villagers. Soldiers dying are an affordance, but villagers? That is what strikes fear into the hearts of man.12679The Sky Darkeners are mindless constructs with one purpose: KILL! Specifically, they are aiming to kill any man or woman that they see fleeing Havenshire for the safety of New Avalon. We certainly can't allow those cowards to make it to safety and then take up arms against us!There is one slight problem. They use saronite arrows for maximum range and damage. Saronite, however, is a metal only found in Northrend, so supplies are limited! Retrieve those arrows for me and I will reward you handsomely.12680How fortuitous it is that the Crusade has a stable full of horses a mere stone's throw from this post. Though they guard it tenaciously, an enterprising young death knight could break through their defenses and take what is rightfully !Once you acquire a horse from the Havenshire Stables, return it to me and I will see what can be done about transforming it into a proper deathcharger.Remember, , it's only stealing if you're caught. Watch out for that deranged stable master, Kitrik!12681That Archmage Pentarus, back in Dalaran, will be expecting us to return with all kinds of reagents and talismans. It seems the locals are fond of animal parts. Twisted claws from the goretalon rocs are among their favorite.It's not my place to say whether the rumors are true or not, but I've a feeling there's something here.The rocs live in the Bonefields off to the northeast, where they feed on the corpses of old mammoths. Will you help me gather talons for the archmage's research?12683There's no more caustic material in all of the basin than bittertide hydra sputum. I've got special containers to collect just such a thing for Archmage Pentarus' studies. Now all I need is a brave, um... collector.You look like a hardy, adventurous . How'd you like to make a bit of money and aid Dalaran's cause at the same time?All you need to do is take this container with you to Bittertide Lake, to the southwest. Engage the hydra and use the container to sample the sputum they shower you with.12684Mam'toth, the god of the mammoths, destroyed himself, and took much of his temple with him, rather than allowing his trolls to gain his power.If I'm to sacrifice a portion of my spirit, I will need something with which to bolster myself.Mam'toth left behind an enormous crater to the northeast, just north of the Altar of Quetz'lun. Within the crater his blood yet lives.Bring it to me.12685This is what it has come down to... revenge.Take this ritual kit and enact it near Quetz'lun's corpse upon her altar. If everything works properly, her spirit should be drawn into the material world where she will be able to reclaim her power from the prophet.The rest will be up to you, . You must slay the prophet in his drained state.12686Ignorance! Dis be intolerable, mon! My entire batch of blight be useless!Dat mongrel, Darmuk! He be responsible for watchin over da blight. He failed me, mon!Dis be a good lesson for ya, . Failure be like a disease dat spreads. Ya gotta catch it and kill it early, before it be killin' you!Take dis scepter. It make my scourged trolls stronger. Use dem ta kill Darmuk. He be lurkin' down below just to da south.Let dat be an example to all, mon. Don't be failin' Drakuru!12687The horse you stole has been taken to the Realm of Shadows. It is there that my dark rider will slay the beast and raise it as a deathcharger. Do you think yourself brave enough to enter the Realm of Shadows in pursuit of the deathcharger?If you accept, I will transport you to the shadow world. Once there, seek out a dark rider in the open fields south of us. To emerge victorious you must slay him, overtake his deathcharger and return it to Death's Breach. Issue the Horseman's Call should you succeed.12688These goblin goons and their minions have decided that they own this pillar and its crystals. I came here to explore the crystals and take samples, but they overpowered me and won't let me return to the camp.If you'll help me fight our way out of here, we can teach these thugs a lesson they'll never forget!1268912690It be time we start our march to Gundrak, mon.

When da chieftains come, my pet Shalewing gunna snatch 'em up and bring 'em here to me.12691The stone coffer appears to be locked.  It appears that a key fits inside a large stone keyhole.Perhaps one of the guardians in the vicinity has this key in its possession.12692Okay, I going back to Frenzyheart Hill to make sure all Frenzyheart know what you done for wolvar and for Zepik. You great hunter and they dumb to think you not.Go back to hill and talk to Elder Harkek... I make sure he knows you not traitor before any other Frenzyheart.Thank you, Lich Hunter.12695Yay!

I meet you there!12696You did a good job helping Wes with getting that flying machine back up and running.If you'd like to help us further, there is an unusual weather pattern coming in from the northeast.  I have a pilot ready to work for me, but I'm afraid he needs a copilot.If you think you're up to it, you can take the flight to Lakeside Landing.  Tell Vic I sent you.12697CHAOS, ! The Crusade is in a frenzy. They have diverted all forces outside of New Avalon to set up a blockade at Light's Point, east of here. They are desperately trying to strip the Havenshire Mine of all resources and load the cargo aboard the frigates they have docked on the coast.Let's stir things up a bit, shall we? Gothik the Harvester, grand necromancer of the Lich King, has graced us with his presence. He has a gift he'd like to bestow upon the Scarlet Crusade. Seek him out.12698I have come from the frozen heart of Naxxramas to feast on souls and deliver a vicious thrashing upon our sworn enemies - and I'm all out of souls.This device I am about to give to you is a portable plague spreader. Take it east, to the Havenshire Mines, and unleash it near the Scarlet miners working inside. Use it to turn the miners into ghouls and return to me when you have a small army at your side. I have saved a special place for them in the vacuum cleaner of souls!12699There's one little problem we have to solve before we head out.  You see, I can't seem to find the keys to my flying machine.I've looked pretty much everywhere for them... maybe you can give me a hand.  Only place I haven't looked yet is inside the lake.I'll even give you my very own air tank.  It's almost empty, but it's got a couple of hits left.12700Only the Scarlet forces at New Avalon and Light's Point challenge us! The time to attack the Scarlet fleet at Light's Point has come.The diversion at the mine has caused chaos amidst their ranks. They are frantically working to clear the area and return to their ships.The time is ripe! Prince Valanar is seizing this opportunity to finish off the Scarlet fleet. Report to him at once!12701In their haste the Crusade will make one fatal error: forgetting to check the mine cars.You are to return to Havenshire Mine, east of here, and locate the mine car that my minions have planted near the outhouse. Climb inside the mine car and a Scarlet miner will unwittingly see to it that you are placed safely behind enemy lines.Once aboard one of their ships, use the cannons against them! SLAUGHTER THEM ALL!Call the Scourge gryphon from the cannon when you are ready to return.12702I bet you not guess what happen again.Nope, not Goregek or chickens.Okay, I lie.

I'm given to understand that you might be heading northeast up to the Zol'Maz Stronghold. Such a trip presents a great opportunity for us to conclude our Drakkari goods gathering.As I have come to know, the Drakkari warlord is extremely paranoid. He's had all of his caches at the stronghold hexed with dire magic. Rumor has it that his tiki warriors carry the cure, but who can say?If you could find the time to acquire some of those goods, I would be most appreciative.12710Ya doin' well, .You be provin' dat I got an eye for talent!

It's your only hope of defeating him.Fight well.12714It is the will of the Lich King that drives us onward, . None are more aware of this than death knights. Our very existence is intrinsically tied to his consciousness. Surely you have heard him speak to you - invading your thoughts...Can you hear him now? Perhaps it is too early for you.Yes, my lord. It will be done., you are to return to Death's Breach and report to Prince Valanar. The Lich King commands it!12715The attacks upon the gates of the last Scarlet bastion have begun.

Bring those back to me along with 10 Crusader skulls. Do I need to tell you where to get those too?12717The cauldron is ready to begin spewing its foul corruption across the land!Now, death knight, a brief lesson in plague cauldrons. The gas that the cauldron emits is deadly to the living, but empowers Scourge. As with all Scourge creations, it feeds off of death and grows stronger the longer it feeds.Take these Crusader skulls and drop them in the cauldron. You will be quite happy with the results.1271812719Nothing less than total annihilation will suffice, . To that end, a few hundred mindless ghouls assaulting the front gate of New Avalon will not do. We must infiltrate the inner sanctum and dispose of their officials. They must be shown that no one can escape the Scourge's grasp!Make your way to the New Avalon Town Hall, southwest of here, and assassinate the mayor. Search the building for the New Avalon registry and bring it to me.12720In my travels across this world I have made several interesting discoveries. For instance, did you know that with the proper amount of encouragement one can extract all the truths that a man dares hide? As luck would have it, I happen to have some encouragement on hand.These are my \"persuaders.\" Equip them and take to the field, death knight. Apply the pointy ends to the soldiers of New Avalon. Discover the truth about this \"Crimson Dawn.\"12721, there is no time left.

You must unlock each of them to set the rhino god free.Gundrak is teeming with ice trolls. However, I believe that if you're careful, you should be able to slip in without too much danger.Once you're done, please inform the witch doctor.12722Most humans would have fled the moment a Scourge necropolis took up residence in their air space. Not the Scarlet Crusade!I must confess - I rather enjoy our exchanges with the Crusade. Through the years, Scourge battles against them have resulted in several of the most tragic events in human history. Yet here we stand - AGAIN - locked in battle!We shan't deny them the pleasures of eternal servitude to the Lich King! Enter New Avalon and fulfill their death wish. Leave no survivors.12723I have sent Orbaz, Thassarian and Koltira behind enemy lines to search for the courier. They have set up a base of operations at the Scarlet Tavern, located at the southern end of New Avalon. The tavern is tucked away behind the two orchards, adjacent to the Chapel of the Crimson Flame. You are to make your way to the tavern and report to Orbaz Bloodbane. He will update you on their situation.12724We haven't got a damned clue about when or where this courier is supposed to show up. None of these humans had an answer either.I did manage to beat something useful out of the last one. Inside Scarlet Hold they keep a schedule of all patrol routes. I want you to break into the hold and steal the schedule.The hold is the largest building in New Avalon - northeast of here.12725Breaking through the Scarlet lines was no easy task. We suffered many casualties during the assault and lost one of our best death knights, Koltira Deathweaver. I don't know whether he's dead or alive, but I'll be damned if we don't search for him.I last saw him being bound in irons and dragged away to the Scarlet Hold, northeast of here. Tear that keep asunder, death knight. Find Koltira!12726Listen to storm, yes?  The Stormwright's Shelf echoes with ancient song.... the Song of Wind and Water.The great tempest devours the sons of typhoons and storms.  Take this drum and play his song... play Haiphoon's song.Help him feed on wind and water so tempest can continue.12727The alarms have been sounded. The High Inquisitor and his acolytes will be here soon. I'm too badly injured to be of much use, but I'll do what little I can to help.Slay the High Inquisitor and his cronies. Tear off his head and return with it to Thassarian. Vengeance will soothe his savage soul.One more thing, . If you do manage to survive and make it back to Thassarian, tell him that they're executing prisoners at the chapel. Perhaps he'll send you there to play the hero once more.12728I need to compile my notes and prepare a presentation for my colleagues in Dalaran.While I do, I must ask that you visit the Winterfin Cavern to the north. You must use the Arcanometer while standing in the mouth of the cavern.Return to me at once when you have the data. My documentation will be incomplete without it.12729The gods have spoken and we must heed their wisdom.Travel north to Zim'Rhuk to destroy guardians there until they yield the unblemished heart. Travel east to the Altar of Quetz'lun and disrupt the altar wardens until you recover their gusty essence.Deliver both to Har'koa and she will combine them into that which will compel late Akali's prophet to appear.12730You must take this instrument of convocation - of summoning - to Zol'Heb just south of Gundrak.Therein you will find a circle of power. Use the convocation to force the prophet of Akali to appear.My heart goes out to you, . We have been through much together, and you have done all that you can to not only save my life, but those of the other gods the Drakkari have destroyed.But I fear this time we may not see each other again until the afterlife.12732One day, Rejek will be mighty warrior. Blood and skyfire will make Rejek strong. You see soon.Rejek give you vial, you take to very top of Suntouched Pillar, far to west. Put waters there in vial.Then go to north edge of basin, to ledge north of Bonefields. You find and kill goretalon matriarch. Take heartblood.You combine heartblood and water, bring to Rejek. Rejek drink, make strong.12733Born of the Lich King's victory over Illidan Stormrage in the heart of the frozen wastes, Death's Challenge is a rite of passage that all death knights must undergo.Seek out other death knights of Acherus and challenge them to a duel. They must accept and fight until a victor emerges!Go now, ! Victory for the Scourge! Glory to the Lich King!12734Rejek just became youngest warrior in all of Frenzyheart tribe. Father gave Rejek a mighty sword to defeat Frenzyheart enemies, but old tradition say sword need to be blooded first. Older warrior usually do that. You do this honor for Rejek?Take blade, put in corpses of all Frenzyheart foes: wasps and hardknuckles to southwest, and the big-tongues. Maybe blood blade on Mistwhispers, far to northwest near Bittertide Lake.12735Earth in Sholazar is pure.  The pillars have protected the land for centuries.Water, not as pure, it comes from outside Sholazar.... from oceans, from lakes, from rivers.  Water sometimes bring bad spirits - need to be cleansed.You take this chime and play at Bittertide Lake, Wintergrasp River and River's Heart.  It make bad spirit angry... and then you must kill it.12736Of course you not as smart as gorloc!  You just simple .You not without hope, though!  You show you can learn.  Maybe crystals make you smart like crystals make us smart!I teach you to play song to clear your mind.  You play song by crystals then crystals make your mind better... not as good as gorloc's but better than you have now.  Lifeblood Pillar is broken, but other pillars still good!12737The storm is a destructive force.  Storm burns trees.  Storm floods houses.But storm can also be life force if you know right song.  In Stormwright Shelf, above Maker's Perch, you can find small dirt mounds.  They very fertile -- they carry inside a strong seed.  All they wait for is the right song.You take this horn and play song for them.12738The cry for vengeance must be heard, . Commander Plaguefist and a company of death knights are on their way to raze the Chapel of the Crimson Flame. If there are any death knights imprisoned at the chapel, Plaguefist will get them out.You can still catch up to them if you hurry. The chapel is due west of here.12739We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, . Seems the Crusade's been real busy.

Dying from falling is a horrible way to go., you have to get these parachutes out to them! At least then they'll have a fighting chance to survive.12741Silly big-tongues think singing to the clouds give them power. Rejek show big-tongues how to get power by taking it!Far to northwest, there is large, flat area the big-tongues call 'Stormwright's Shelf.' Rejek is sure you can only get there by flying like bird.On this shelf, Rejek has heard of mighty forces of wind and water.

I salute you, .12754While you were out burning churches and murdering vermin, I've been busy formulating a plan.The Scarlet courier is scheduled to pass by the Scarlet Overlook within the hour. The roads by the overlook are wide open and swarming with Crusaders. Use this makeshift cover to hide at the overlook and wait for the Scarlet Courier to pass. When he's close enough, strike with all your fury! Cut him down and take his belongings - including his clothes!The overlook is 200 paces east of here.12755This message must reach Abbendis. We do not want to draw their suspicion. They must continue under the assumption that everything is going as they planned.You will don the Scarlet courier's clothes and with the help of some dark magic, take on the form of the courier.Abbendis is at King's Harbor, southeast of the Scarlet Overlook. Drop off the message and get as much information out of her as you can. She will tell us what we need to know about the \"Crimson Dawn.\"12756Listen well, courier. The Scarlet lands are lost.

We have secret weapon though... we sent it out to Soo-met so he can use to protect all Oracles.Secret weapon is from Great Ones themselves... extra shiny crystals found inside sacred Great One temples. Be very careful... no break them.Crystals are in chest near shrine at Sparktouched Haven, in far southwest. You go use crystals to help Soo-met beat the puppy-men.12762We need to do something to stop puppy-men attacking Sparktouched Haven. Jaloot brought me very special crystal that he found in River's Heart... we seen only one like it before.The crystal not have power now, but the opened up lifeblood pillar should have energy to recharge it if you just bring it close. Once the crystal is charged, go to Sparktouched Haven in far southwest and let the crystal's energy make you big and strong.Then it time to kick some puppy-men butt.12763As pressing as our needs are here, there's news from the lands to the north that cannot be ignored.I've just received a message from the Argent Crusade. It seems that scourge forces are gathering there and are threatening to overrun Zul'drak.Needless to say, , if that were to happen our struggle here would be meaningless.

Speak to Samuel if you need transportation.Dismissed.12778The trap has been sprung, death knight. The armies of Hearthglen and Tirisfal have arrived, just in time to see their enclave in flames! If they turn back now, they fight us with their backs turned.No, they have only one option, which has only one outcome: APOCALYPSE!As we speak, they prepare to make one final stand.The Lich King awaits your return, champion. He stands watch below us, at Death's Breach.12779You have slaughtered legions beyond number and still your dark heart craves more. Your hunger knows no end, .There must come an end to all things, death knight. The Scarlet armies make their final stand against us. For them, there is no escape... no choice.

With it you will end the Scarlet Crusade.12789Ready yourself, . I'm dispatching you to Light's Breach, northeast of here.I've received word that the Scourge are making a push to take over Zul'Drak.This will not come to pass.See to it that you assist in the destruction of the Scourge there.

You'll enjoy his company, they said....Well it's not as if I had a choice in the matter. Finklestein is the Crusade's best alchemist. I suppose I should be honored that he's chosen my post to set up shop. But ever since he's arrived, I've been relegated to collecting various alchemical ingredients.Say, , how about you give me a hand? Just south of here are some pools that are haunted by spirits of ancient trolls. Collect their ectoplasm for me.12800The Scarlet Enclave is no more.

I might not be a titan historian, but it sounds like she fits the bill.I also know that if the Scourge cross the border between the Lost Lands and the rest of Sholazar, our expedition's as good as dead.  What do you say you go look for her and lend a hand?12804Sometimes, there's nothing worse than a camp full of hunters. They're all so busy taking down prey animals that the only meat I get is tough and stringy. That's hardly the kind of thing you want to come home to after a long day on the hunt.Lucky for us, though, there is a source of tender, succulent meat nearby. To the south of the river and the camp live longneck grazers. They're a perfect source of meat for our hungry hunters. Bring me back the best cuts of meat and we'll properly toast our comrades.12805The Lifeblood Pillar was toppled over with great force, sending the very earth into an upheaval.The elementals that wander the sundered shard carry with them the very life essence that gave the pillar its strength.  I cannot allow this energy to be wasted, for only four pillars remain.Head to the sundered shard, to the southeast, and seek the lifeblood elementals.Use this gem on their remains to recover their rampant energy.  We'll need the energy to heal the land when all this is over.12806Some would say that our most critical mission lies not with the Lich King, but with the utter destruction of the Scarlet Onslaught. I would say that is foolish, but who am I to judge?Death's Rise is far to the southwest, overlooking the sea along the cliff wall. There you will find Lord-Commander Arete personally overseeing the Onslaught's destruction himself.Do see to it that you report to him with all due haste. He asked for you personally.12807We have much to do, but first I believe a short refresher is in order.We death knights have a colorful past with our Scarlet friends who idiotically rest comfortably in the harbor below us to the northwest.When you are ready for an earful, speak with me again and I shall provide enlightenment.12810The forces at Onslaught Harbor are heavily reinforced by gryphon riders. You need a mount that will enable you to put them down. But first, we need the components for the ritual that is going to make it all happen.A great deal of blood is necessary for the ritual to be undertaken.There is a readily available supply down there in the harbor... sharks. Do not return to me until you've filled this bladder with their blood.12813How kind... how generous our lord-commander is. Where he is flowers and sunshine, I am filled only with hatred.It is not enough to end their miserable lives... I want them humiliated... debased!What could be more unspeakable than to be turned into that which you hate? To dedicate your existence to eradicating a thing, and then in the end to become it?How sad.Take this tincture northwest to Onslaught Harbor. Apply it to their still corpses and watch what happens, but avoid the cathedral.12814What could be more fitting than to take one of their own gryphons to use against them? Go to Onslaught Harbor and take the reins to one of their gryphons from the dead clutches of its rider.Return with the gryphon, delivering it to Uzo Deathcaller. He will see to its proper transformation and provide you with further instructions.12815Now that you got your bone gryphon, I wantcha to take it back down there everyday and make a no fly zone over Onslaught Harbor.I gotta admit, mon, I don't really care if you use the bone gryphon to kill them gryphon riders or not. But I'm guessin' that if you do, you'll find it much easier to get to 'em.Besides, it's got lots of neat tricks you can use.12818To the point... Ricket's asked me to put together some stronger land mines, but I'm running low on parts.Just west of town, you'll find the remains of our last rocket sled... Ricket got a little excited when she was fueling it, but I probably should have thought to not put the nozzle right over the exhaust. Live and learn, eh?There should be a good stock of spare parts scattered around the destroyed sled... why don't you go ahead and chase off those scavengers and nab me some of that wreckage?12819Blast it! Where are my tools? I had them here just a moment ago.Oh! I probably forgot them when I was setting up that minefield in the west. That's mildly inconvenient. I'd be quite appreciative if you could go get them for me. You'll need to watch your step though... you should be able to use the same path that I did to get out.Oh, and don't try to fly in... I had the presence of mind to set up turrets to shoot down anything that might fly, and they aren't very discerning in who they target.12820I've been waiting an eternity for these mines! Well, a few days at least. What took him so long?Here's the low down, compadre... there's this nasty bunch of magnataur--you know, big, hairy, and extremely ugly--and they seem pretty keen on taking K3 for themselves.Not going to happen.We've got some defenses set up in their path, northeast of here. Sadly, our laser turrets have pretty limited power supplies... that's where these mines come in! Get over there and blow them up good!12821The sapper squad is ready. That means it's fun time, my dear!There's only one thing holding us up from our full-scale assault on Garm! I sent a runner to set a teleporter up behind Garm--successfully I might add--and he returned to get the power cell it needs to function. It isn't working yet... which means the power cell didn't get there.I need you to look just on the other side of Garm's Bane for the power cell. When you find it, bring it farther east to Garm's Rise and activate the teleporter.12822Now that we have the teleporter open, my plan is quite complex... it has several facets and will take impeccable coordination. And there are supplies to be gathered! And troops to recruit! Likely, weeks of hard labor as well!Hahah, I had you going there for a moment, didn't I? You've got this, kid. Hop through the teleporter and take the fight to them! Our sappers will back you up... they won't have anywhere to run.12823Hey there! Joining us for the assault I assume?I've got a special task for you... we're going to bring the whole cave down on their heads! Towards the back of their cave, you should find Frostgut's Altar.  Sneak up and plant this hardpacked explosive bundle somewhere close to it.Once the charge is placed, stick around just long enough to make sure Frostgut bites it, then get out quickly! There's no knowing how long the cave will last once that thing goes off!12824You've got some swift feet on you sonny! Thanks for lending a hand with those explosives... I've been waiting to give that invention a good test run for a while!Go ahead and tell Ricket we should be covered on the magnataur front now... my sappers will clean up any of the remaining baddies.Thanks again!12826Looking good!No, not you - my new mines. You're just a little full of yourself, aren't you? I, on the other hand, am absolutely brilliant! My intellect cannot be matched.What were we talking about? Oh yes, my new mines! New and improved... ready for whatever devious use Ricket has concocted.Be a  and go hand them off to Ricket, will you? She's right over there... it should be quite the epic journey, I'm sure. Be careful though, she's a little loopy.12827Hey hey! You're a new face! Care to lend Ricket a hand?We have a somewhat unexpected problem - food shortage. I know, I know... we should have seen that coming, but you don't get it. We tend to have somewhat of a quick turn-around here with our sapper squad and all, so usually we don't have to worry about long term eats. Good old K3's gotten popular though.Convenient solution? There are gnoll camps to the west and some gnolls scattered, scavenging as gnolls do. Care to go nab some of their rations?12828Wow! That stuff is nasty. Not to account for gnoll taste or anything, but I figured whatever they had would at least be... edible?Let's get more creative.Tore's got an explosive dispenser north of town... not far from the big cavern entrance, can't miss it. I'm sure she intends them for mining purposes of some sort, but I've got a better idea.Grab one of those things and rush it to one of the nearby mammoths... most of them are to the west. Collect the meat, bring it back.12829Hiya! The name's Tore. I  head up the mining operation here at K3... or I will shortly anyway!This here cave is full of creepy-crawlies. I think we could do with a few less spiders before we move in - what'd you think?12830We're moving in!There were some snobolds here when we arrived... their mining operation seems to have met some unfortunate happenings though. Doesn't much matter - we were taking over soon anyway.I sent some of our miners in there to get me some ore samples that I can use to calibrate our machines for processing, but they haven't come back.Mind going in there and nabbing some samples for me in their stead? The snobolds probably have some on them, though I'd expect most of them are dead by now.12831Oi... it's like there's a propeller in my stomach.I think I can walk, but I got something nasty in my system when I got bit by something in the back of the cave. It was bigger than the other spiders... and brightly colored.Ricket can probably make me an antidote, but she'd need the venom sac from whatever bit me. Would you mind finding it for me? I don't think Tore's coming.I'll just pretend I'm dead here and hopefully they'll leave me alone.12832Oi - thank you! I thought for sure I'd just be a spider snack. Perhaps I'm speaking a bit soon though - let's get the heck out of here!Let me know as soon as you're ready to go... make it quick.12833Hey there again! You didn't run off like all the other adventurers did? Well, you're just a peach, aren't ya? I was beginning to think I smelled funny or something!We could still use a bit of a hand around here, and you have just the right experience.  Remember those magnataur? Well apparently the cave didn't completely collapse... there are still quite a few left. So much for Gino taking care of them, eh?Fortunately, Jeer made way more than enough mines. You've got this!12836I know just the job for an eager newcomer! We've got a gnoll problem. You might even call it a gnoll infestation! Pesky things. They keep creeping up more and more, and now they're on our doorstep, stealing our parts! Inconceivable.It all begins and ends with their uppity leader, Gnarlhide. I want you to see to that \"ends\" part. Go pay him a visit at his camp all the way to the west, in Snowblind Hills.And when I say \"pay him a visit,\" that's a euphemism for \"kill him painfully.\" Kay? Kay!12838I need to know what the Scarlet Onslaught is planning today. You will be my instrument in this task.Fly to Onslaught Harbor and rifle through their baggage trunks for documents. The trunks will be locked, so you'll have to take the keys from the Scarlet Onslaught members by whatever means.12839At first this note looks like any of the other intel that you've been looking for. However, a quick perusal of its contents disabuses you of this notion.The letter conveys that Grand Admiral Westwind is present somewhere on the island, but that he is keeping himself secluded for now. He speaks of a glorious day that is coming soon in which the Scarlet Onslaught will wash over first the Lich King and then the rest of world to finally bring order to Azeroth.The lord-commander will want to see this!12840If anyone knows where the admiral is, then surely it must be his captains on the ships in Onslaught Harbor.Welsington and Hartford are their names if memory serves. Go beat the information out of them and then end their miserable lives.I want to know where the grand admiral is hidden!12841Yes, it must be the green-skinned prisoner you're after...  We might be able to help each other.You're not going to get the goblin out of here by force.  Not alive, anyway.Among my people I am known as a Yrkvinn, a practitioner of illusions.  As you can see, the Hyldnir have made me their prisoner.If I had my runes, I could make you go unnoticed among them.  Further inside, patrolling the mines, you'll find an overseer named Syra.  She has my runes.  Retrieve them and we'll talk some more.12842The mark of war is etched indelibly upon your soul, death knight. You have learned the dark art of runeforging and with it you will engrave runes of power upon your weaponry.Preparations for battle must be made.

We were in the middle of an expedition into the mountains to set up a transmission tower when we were attacked.They looked like vrykul, except their skin was blue and layered with frost.... and they were all female!  They took all the men in the expedition and let us women go.  Please, !  We think they're being held in Sifreldar, the village overlooking K3.12844Please, .  When the Hyldnir took our men, they also took all our equipment.  Of course, it's more important that we get our boys back, but if you run into any of our equipment, I'd really appreciate it if you brought it back to us.You'll find their village just above us, to the north.12846All of our boys are back... thanks to you, !  Well... all but one.My brother Zeev is still up there according to the others.  Apparently they have some sort of mine where they make their prisoners work.  Go in there and see if you can find out anything.12847I'd heard they have an archbishop in their cathedral, but I had no idea that they'd resurrected and promoted Landgren! The Crimson Cathedral is heavily guarded with only one entrance, so you'll need help.We still need to know where the grand admiral is, but this time we're not taking any chances!Take this device. It can be used to summon a gate for me to step through once you've killed the archbishop.I'll have my answers directly from his compelled soul!

A mysterious note found its way to Explorers' League headquarters in Ironforge, with no indication of where it came from. All it said was that we're to meet Brann at his camp and help him with his search.From what I can tell, the camp should be located northeast of here, across the Bor's Breath River and at the foot of some ruins from the Path of the Titans.12855The tone of Brann's note suggests he meant to bury something with the note, maybe a pack of some kind. You're sure this was all you found?Okay, I'm going to have you take one of these frosthounds with you. The frostborn use them for tracking. Bring it to the destroyed camp and let it get Brann's scent.It should at least lead you to the location of those missing possessions, and if we're lucky, Brann himself.12856To be slain honorably on the field of battle brings us all glory. To be frozen in a block of ice and endlessly taunted does not....You are to fly to the frost giant city of Dun Niffelem, just east of the Valley of Ancient Winters, and liberate our captive proto-drakes.

First time use one of these things; plus, Chief Rageclaw is wolvar, not person.12858Thank the Light that someone got my message. Now that I'm safe from the iron dwarves, I need to ask your help with something. I've got a lead on Norgannon's keystone, which guards access to Ulduar's archives, but the Titans divided it into two pieces and secreted them away.One of the pieces, the keystone's shell, is held within the Inventor's Library on the northern coast, south of Ulduar itself. The first thing you'll need to do is retrieve the fragments of an access disk from the library's guardians.12859Trolls attack Rageclaw Den and kick Rageclaw out! It get worse. Trolls now burning village! This very bad. Chief make top Rageclaw shaman, Moky, do study on fire. Results very surprising! Fire still hot and can burn things.Will you help Rageclaw and put fire out? Moky has special Rageclaw fire extinguisher for you. Use special fire extinguisher to put out fire at Rageclaw Den to southeast. Sometimes take many sprays to douse fire, but extinguisher always have water! Rageclaw magic strong!12860That disk you assembled... it's blank! That crafty Mimir must've hidden the information somewhere else. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there?That might be what you need to do with the disk. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key.12861Drakuru... You know who this troll is? I think bad troll are controlled by the Drakuru troll. They call themself Drakuru trolls - that how I know. Now you see why I am chief of Rageclaw. Smartest of all wolvar!But that not why I talk to you now. Bad troll come and kick Rageclaw out of den. Rageclaw that no run away held as prisoner in village. You go to Rageclaw Den, southeast, and free captured Rageclaw. Kill troll for lock opener. You maybe kill many troll for many lock opener.12862So...  so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains.Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening.Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.12863Ah! Thanks for coming up here, .Judging by your wide eyes and shivering hands, I'd venture a guess that you're somewhat new. Sounds like it would be good for you to meet our gracious hosts then!We've got some extra medical supplies... to be honest, we weren't expecting to have such a comfortable setup. Go ahead and give this crate to Glorthal over there, and lend them a hand if you would too. We don't want them to think we're ungrateful for how welcoming they've been.12864There is something that I could use a hand with now that I have you.We have a few scouts that are extremely late in returning. The peaks are harsh... but these boys know what they're doing.Head to the east... along the Bor's Breath valley and near Bor's Fall... they should be out that direction. If you find any sign of one of them, bring me back news immediately. We have a few enemies in the area - if any of them are getting a bit uppity, the more warning the better.12865Fresh blood! Good to meet ya! I've got some work if you've got some time.Off to the east are the Foot Steppes... pretty hard land, but there's quite a group of rhino that graze there. Our birds have a taste for that rhino meat, but it's always a bit dangerous for them to go hunting with all of the proto-drakes that nest around there.If you're keen, head over that way and get some rhino meat, bring it back to the peaks above here, and then use it to feed some of the eagles that nest there.12866Damn harpies. We've beat that bunch into submission more times than I can remember... and they stay quiet for a time after each bout. This time, I'd thought that maybe it sunk in.Apparently not.Their memory may be a bit short, but if their numbers are thinned enough, they'll keep to themselves. Head into the valleys in the north and east and clear out a fair chunk of them for me, will ya?12867A few weeks ago, if you looked up, you'd see dozens of those beautiful eagles soaring the skies. Now, only a few if any. They've taken to staying with their nests nearly all the time now because the harpies have been stealing their eggs.The harpies have grown a taste for eagle flesh, it seems... the sick wretches are caring for the eggs long enough to feast on the hatchlings. Go into the valleys to the north or the east and find the eggs... bring them back here, and I'll take them back to the nests.12868This Sirana Iceshriek sounds like the one that's spurring the harpies to be more aggressive. If we kill her, I suspect their attacks won't last long afterwards.One of our stormriders claims to have spotted her circling the peak directly northwest of here.  Go find the wench and put her down. Let's see this done.12869You were there with Loken, weren't you? The iron dwarves captured Veranus, the brood mother of the proto-drakes. The drakes don't seem even a little bit happy about the situation... they've gotten very aggressive.They've pushed into stormcrest territory and the eagles have taken to an all out fight with them. It's time to return the favor. We're riding to the Foot Steppes and slaughtering them there.King Stormheart left this hammer to me - make good use and see to it that I get it back.12870Why hello thar!Before you be headin' off to do your grand questin' and adventure, might I beg a wee favor of ya, ?These mountains be packed full'a precious relics and baubles... this place be a dream come true for tha league. I'd be much obliged if ya could bring any such treasures you stumble upon back ta me. You can even share in me ale for tha trouble! Trust me , that's a rich deal!12871Interesting. I don't see any locking mechanisms on the shell. That suggests to me that it may take more than just finding the other piece to combine the keystone.Take the shell back to the expedition leader, Lagnus, at Frosthold. Once he gets over his awe, he should be able to glean what the core looks like based on the shell, and maybe they can get the Frost Dwarves to help find it.I'm going to see if I can find out how to combine the two pieces. We'll catch up once we've both made some progress.12872Charging inventor's disk.Disk charging completed.Preparing emergency protocol gamma.Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified.Please have a pleasant millennium.12873Definitely... I can see exactly what the core must look like. If any of the frostborn have seen it, they'll be sure to recognize the description.There's no time to waste, let's get straight to business. Go talk to King Stormheart and request his aid... he's sure to know someone who can help us find the core. And be nice about it will you - he's very respected around here.12874I be more than willing ta lend my shelter and home ta travelers in need, but I'm nae too keen ta force my people inte yer affairs.I'll tell ye what... my people are warriors, straight and true. On the day a frostborn becomes a man, he has ta prove himself in battle. He has ta show us that he'll not let size hold'm back.Show me yer as strong and fierce as one of my men, and I'll have them lend ye an ear or a blade. Speak ta Fjorlin over by the cliff to the south there and he'll put ye ta the test.12875I don't know where this core is hiding, but ye knew that. I said I'd help though, and that I shall.There's a hermit by the name of Drom Frostgrip who lives in a cave north of here... down in tha valley. We've strayed away from the titans a bit ourselves being that there are so few about, but Drom's loyal to the old ways... he keeps an eye on their most precious places and speaks te the keeper Creteus often.Yer sure to find him in the back of his cave... tell'm I sent ye and he'll help ye.12876Our scouts have spotted iron dwarves in the valley north of here. I overheard King Stormheart sending you to visit Drom and I'm admittedly a bit worried about'm.If you find any iron dwarves when you head down there, put'm down hard and fast for me, eh? I dun think they know exactly where we are or how to get here just yet, and I'd prefer to keep it that way.12877I never found the core... but I've often spoken to the keeper Creteus, and his omissions give him away. You'll find Creteus over the mountains to the east, in the Foot Steppes, keeping watch on the Engine of the Makers. The core might well be in there, but you'll need to win Creteus's favor.The iron dwarves were here looking for something... it might well be the core. They took my ring. Find their leader, get the ring back, and show it to Creteus so that he knows I sent you.12878During your absence, I was privileged enough to parley with the dwarf Brann Bronzebeard. This dwarf indicated his purpose for seeking the keystone, and I am satisfied that it is for satisfactory intent... I believe this dwarf may be the entity for which the keystone was created.Norgannon's Core is located in the Frigid Tomb to the southeast. Its guardians are ancient beings of ice, and they will not welcome your presence. Best these guardians and retrieve the keystone with my blessing, .1287912880Combining the keystone will require Norgannon's Binding - a device located in the Engine of the Makers, the large pit beside us. Brann should be down there with the other half of the keystone now. I have instructed him on the use of the device. He awaits your presence.I will do what I can to keep the iron dwarves occupied, but I do not have confidence that I will hold them for long. King Stormheart is returning to the defense of Frosthold with some of his men shortly. Please hurry, .12882Welcome to the peaks.I have a simple request before you head off on whatever grand jaunt you have planned.

Scour their village - southeast of here - for clues as to who or what is in charge of these attacks.12903We were attacked by Prince Navarius and at least a dozen Scourge. I told Dargath and the twins to stay inside the tank, but they wouldn't listen. Dargath looked me in the eyes and said, \"If somebody doesn't get out of this tank, they'll kill us all.\" He then made Reed cut the engine and charged. Most heroic thing I've ever seen.I heard the Prince barking orders to the monsters. Sounded like he was taking them to Thrym's End, northwest of here. We have to rescue our friends. Will you go look for them?12904They... They killed my brother.Slaughtered him like he was some sort of animal. Now they got him laid out on one of their tables on the other side of the camp, ready for their grisly experiments. Dargath's dead too. The paladin made a heroic stand at the ruins to the northeast, but the leader of the Vargul, Algar, was too strong.I'm all that's left and I'll be dead soon too. I... I'm turning.If the Light won't grant me vengeance, maybe you will, . Kill them all.12905Our deal is made then, .  You help me get out of these chains and I'll help you find your little green friend.The Hyldnir who runs this mine is known as Mildred the Cruel -- and with good reason.Tell her you've been sent to lend a hand with the mines.  Do whatever she asks until she trusts you with the keys to my shackles.12906Let's start you off with something straightforward.  The male vrykul that work the mines for us do so against their will... purely out of fear of our blades.Once in a while, one of them will lose their motivation.  Find any uncooperative vrykul and put them in their place.Take this disciplining rod.  You'll want to inflict pain, not death.  Well, most of the time anyway.12907For every action there is an opposite reaction, sister.  In the case of us applying pressure on the males, this has meant newly spread rumors of insurrection.The bearded pig behind this rabble-rousing is called Garhal.  Put an end to him... and make sure the other males see his demise.  They must learn that insubordination will not be tolerated.12908You are without mercy.  You will do well around these parts.I have another task to ask of you.  There is a female vrykul prisoner that's become more of a liability than I had anticipated.She had the gall to claim the right to take part in the Hyldsmeet, our sacred competition of strength and fighting prowess.Here's the key to her shackles.  Make it as painless as possible.  She's a female after all, even if not one of us.12909In order to track down Brann, we're going to need a creature with a keen sense of smell and a good tracking ability. There weren't any hounds on the zeppelin, but I think I have a substitute.After the crash, I sent Khaliisi down the east face of the mountain to start hunting for food. Her cat, Frostbite, excels at tracking prey in the snow. Tell her that she'll have to part with her companion for a while, at least. She can hunt on her own, but we have no other way of catching up to Brann Bronzebeard.12910Boktar can have his way this time, but I'll expect him to make it up to me. Don't look at me like that. Boktar may be in command, but no one tells a hunter what to do.'Put that beast away,' he says. 'Make it stop growling.'All of a sudden he changes his mind when it suits him. Next time he complains, Frostbite'll just nip him a bit. Don't worry, she'll do an admirable job tracking your prey. After she locates her target, you're on your own to deal with iron dwarves, or Brann, or whatever you find.12912You are not like the others, little one. You do not reek of the ancient death. Perhaps you can be trusted.I am Gymer, king of the storm giants. I was lured here by my brother, Thiassi, now an undead servant of the Lich King. By the time I realized that his cry for help was a trap, it was too late. I am now a prisoner of the Scourge and I fear that soon I will suffer the same fate as many of the other storm giants.Find a way to release me from this cage and I will aid you to the best of my ability.12913Ruk MogOth red a mogoth ta eft Thros-garE Haldir.Kha gor ruk khaz ta ke ruk hrim eft thros-am-kha ruk kost-um havar go kost.A modoss hine ruk bergum eft thros-am-kha ga eft Haldir ke loch Thon we lo gefrunon ta mitta. Gar Ruk dagUm loch angor-magi ta har ruk!12914Now you say that he's locked up in a 100 foot tall cage, eh?If my calculations are correct, we should be able to at least weaken the hinges on the cage, giving the giant enough leeway to break out.If this is going to work I'm going to need some plasticizers and stabilizers.Banshee essence should do nicely for the plasticizer. You can get that from the banshees in the Dead Fields, northeast of us. The stabilizer can be found on the earthragers to the southwest, near Ebon Watch.Get a move on!12915If I hope to wrest control of the Temple of the Makers from my brother, I must make amends with my old allies.Perhaps by eliminating a common enemy, we may at least take a step towards renewing my friendship with the frost giants.Fjorn has besieged Dun Niffelem with giants of iron. You must defeat him at Fjorn's Anvil, far to the east of here, and weaken his forces sufficiently for the Sons of Hodir to emerge victorious.Take this charm, . Use it to summon my earthen to your aid.12916What I'm about to give you is called seaforium. It is a highly volatile explosive with some unique properties. Due to its malleable nature, you will be able to fill in the hinges and cracks of the cage for maximum damage.Return to your friend and use the jumbo seaforium charge to set him free.Let's hope he honors the bargain. He's our only hope.12917I suppose we shouldn't have expected to find Brann so easily, not with our luck. If we can make sense of what Brann is saying, you can persuade him to give up his location.The power of the wind is strong in these mountains, and it may prove a great boon to us. A knowledgeable shaman can hear the sound of all the world's tongues on the wind.To the northwest, on the Snowdrift Plains, you will find beings made of wind, the stormriders. Capture their voices and bring them to me.12919My people have been decimated by the Lich King. The Scourge now use the corpses of storm giants to create mindless flesh giants, or worse, stitched together aberrations like Thrym.I will stop at nothing to see them all driven from this world. We will work together to destroy the Scourge that threaten Zul'Drak.We will kill them all: Navarius, Algar and Thrym!When you are ready, let me know and we will begin our destructive journey.12920What are you waiting for? The language barrier has been broken, thanks to Moteha. Contact Brann Bronzebeard and find out anything you can about where he's hiding and what he's chasing after.Maybe we can still salvage something from this disaster.12921Excellent.  There's an exit in the eastern end of the mine that leads to Brunnhildar Village.  Follow it and I'll meet you there.We must not be seen together so no one suspects you of aiding me.  I'll use my magic to disguise my appearance.  Do not worry,  -- we'll find your friend in no time.12922Beneath its porous exterior, this hunk of metal gleams with a mysterious quality.You feel it would only be prudent to burn off the slag at Fjorn's Anvil.As you ponder where in this frozen waste you might find something hot enough for the job, a fire revenant crosses your path...1292312924This is all beginning to have the smell of fate's hand, .Your discovery is what remains of my armor, long ago cast off in a fit of grief and left to the elements. Only the sons of Hodir are capable of its reforging, for they are its original creators.Perhaps you've done enough to soften their hatred of me. Seek out their king, Jokkum, if he still breathes.Find your way into his good graces and plead for his assistance.12925The Lich King sent emissaries to us on three different occasions.  All three were promptly dismembered.Our sisters in Valkyrion were not as dedicated to our traditions and accepted the Scourge's advances.  Now instead of capturing their drakes from the wild, they raise them from the blight and filth that the Scourge wallow in.Take the frost oil that the Valkyrion Hyldnir carry on them and use it to freeze any blighted eggs you find.  Rumors speak of a fetid pool of blight where the eggs are kept.12926We've seen the iron dwarves and their constructs making war on the creatures of stone that Brann calls the earthen, along with their giant allies. Contact him and aid him in any way you can, and remember that anything we can learn from his search may aid us in fighting against the iron dwarves and their master.12927That disk you assembled... it's blank! Keeper Mimir, the tinker who built this library, must've hidden the information elsewhere. Look around the Inventor's Library; do you see any databanks there?That might be the disk's purpose. Try using it near some of those databanks. Perhaps it's set to retrieve and store information from them. After you've tried your hand at that, contact me again and let me know what you've found. Meanwhile, I'll be trying to track down the other half of the archive key.12928Charging inventor's disk.Disk charging completed.Preparing emergency protocol gamma.Emergency protocol loaded. Please use the charged disk to activate the guardian of Norgannon's shell, Archivist Mechaton. The archivist will release the shell once your identity has been verified.Please have a pleasant millennium.12929The earthen who once inhabited, built, and maintained Ulduar were ousted from their home when Loken took over the city. Since then, his iron dwarf followers have relentlessly attacked the exiles.They have taken refuge in an old titan building, which they now call Bouldercrag's Refuge, on the face of a mountain west of the Inventor's Library. Bouldercrag and his brethren fight to keep the irons from overrunning their haven, but they cannot hold their ground long. Find and help them, .12930It seems so long ago that these hammers pounded and hewed stone instead of iron. Our expulsion from Ulduar saw the weakest of us dead and the strongest of our craftsmen reborn as warriors.As the irons beat us back, even the strongest find themselves failing.We can do little for the wounded, save when we have a stock of enchanted earth. We used to mine it from the deposits on the sheer cliff face to the northwest, but the constant battle has prevented us from replenishing our stock. Would you help?12931The refuge's defenders have done their best to blunt the iron dwarves' attacks, but we keep losing ground inch by inch. My men are hardy, but not tireless. Without reinforcements, it's only a matter of time until we will be overrun.Would you lend your skills to the refuge's defense? It would greatly improve the morale of the defenders and give them -- and me -- hope of mounting a counterattack.Kill any of the stormforged or their creations you encounter outside the refuge.12932I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand. These trolls are dirtier than ogres; but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Zul'Drak, pal.You're new to this racket, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match.If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?12933This next match is a doozy, buddy! Apparently some magnataur from the Dragonblight wants a piece of the action. You ever fought one of those before? All I can tell you is to aim high!We'll get this party started when you give me the word.12934I'm not gonna lie to you, pal. You might be overmatched here. This next one is a being from the elemental planes! I don't even know what's gonna show up in that arena!If you think you're up to it, get in there and give 'em hell!12935This next one's fightin' from a dark place, kid. The kind of dark that can only happen when you've been on the flip-side. He's hungry and willing to do whatever it takes to win. Watch yourself! I've heard he wrestles yetis for exercise!We'll start when you're ready.12936You're not gonna believe this, pal. Your next fight is against Korrak the Bloodrager! Looks like the Drakkari trolls are pulling a power play! And let me tell you, buddy, he's been sippin' the animal god juice. He's good and ready to pound you into the ground.Are you ready?12937The refuge's defenders fight bravely, but they cannot keep up with the iron onslaught.With the earth you collected, I can make bandages to help heal the wounds of some of the fallen. The more defenders we can patch up, the longer we'll last out there.Take these poultices and use them to heal the wounds of the fallen defenders outside the refuge. Get as many back into the battle as possible, . Every casualty is one too many.12938We need you focused, . We're barely holding The Shadow Vault as it is. As you can see, we've greatly angered the Lich King.I need you to speak with Duke Lankral. He's in charge here now. You'll find him inside the vault building proper.Were I you, I would not keep him waiting.12939The first step we're going to take is at a place in Jotunheim called the Savage Ledge. It's just over the mountains to the west.On the ledge the vrykul warriors are always sparring, being instructed in the finer arts of battle by their thane's men.I want you to take this flag and issue a challenge to a number of them. Let's demoralize them with the 'mere' skills of a , shall we?129401294112942Traitors.  We Hyldnir have little love for them.The dwellers of Valkyrion have gone unpunished for far too long.  While we remained loyal to Thorim, they became the Lich King's lapdogs!They call the ones who receive his gift val'kyr.  They fly on feathered wings, like the harpies they are.You will find Valkyrion far to the northwest, beyond the Temple of Storms.  Slay these winged she-wolves, sister.  Slay them and I will reward you with one of my most prized possessions.12943Thane Ufrang the Mighty sits within his hall overlooking the Savage Ledge. I've studied him. The thane is a patient vrykul, with a head for strategy and warfare. He's also shown a penchant for biding his time and not wanting to overplay his hand in the ongoing battle.I need him dead!I've written a decree. Stand before the thane and read it aloud.It should... unnerve him at the least.1294412945129461294712948This is the end, my friend! Your last opponent is going to be your greatest challenge. He's a vrykul champion from the steppes of Icecrown and he's out for blood! Defeat him and you'll be crowned the champion of the Amphitheater of Anguish! This fight is going to make us both rich!Let me know when you're ready and we'll start.12949, the key to my shackles is hanging around the neck of Instructor Hroegar outside.Perhaps you could retrieve it by separating his head from his shoulders?1295012951The most important thing that you can do right now is to return to The Shadow Vault and let Baron Sliver know that I've failed.You see, I wasn't the only one captured by these vrykul devils. My entire contingent of death knights was also taken.I should have seen the trap before it was sprung, but there's no use crying over spilled milk now is there?Go on before you get captured, too! I'll see you back at the vault.12953The crate is filled with incendiary harpoons.  You recall seeing harpoon guns and dry stacks of hay outside.Perhaps Iva will appreciate the extra effort and reward you appropriately.12955Mrrfrmrfrrmrrr...Sorry about that. It can sometimes be hard to understand what I'm saying. You know how it is.I wanted to make sure that if you find yourself at the Savage Ledge, over the mountains to the west, that you make sure to eliminate the competition there.Specifically, I'd like you to challenge to duels and humiliate Sigrid Iceborn, Efrem the Faithful, Onu'zun, and Tinky Wickwhistle in front of the vrykul.12956Clearly, this is more than an ordinary hunk of metal.Unlike any ore you're familiar with, it is hard but not brittle, far lighter than it looks, and glows even when cool.Looking closer, you can make out one of Thorim's runes shining beneath the surface....12957To the southwest, on the western side of the Snowdrift Plains, the iron dwarves have dug a mine into the hillside. There, they use captive mechagnomes, servants of Keeper Mimir, to mine ore.I don't know where these mechagnomes came from, nor what they would do with their freedom, but perhaps we can win their help.Go to the Frozen Mine, , and set these creatures free from their bondage. Ask if they would fight alongside us against iron dwarf tyranny.12958A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Blood Jade Amulets to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12959A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Glowing Ivory Figurines to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12960A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Wicked Sun Brooches to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12961A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Intricate Bone Figurines to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12962A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Bright Armor Relics to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12963A wealthy shipping concern has requested a collection of Shifting Sun Curios to sell at Undermine.   If you can bring me one, I can reward you with a Dalaran Jewelcrafter's Token.12964At the Frozen Mine in the western part of the Snowdrift Plains, the stormforged iron dwarves have constructed a mine manned by slaves.It's well behind the lines, so we haven't been able to find out much about what's going on there, but my scouts have reported seeing them remove cartloads of dark, sickly looking ore.12965The one who commands the stormforged iron dwarves is called Runeseer Valduran. Although I have never seen them, it is said that his master, Keeper Loken, who took over Ulduar, has given Valduran powerful titan artifacts.It could explain the strength and ferocity my men see in the stormforged warriors.Valduran's base, Nidavelir, lies to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains. Go there, , and neutralize his power. Destroy these gifts of Loken's and help us to sap the strength of his followers.12966So it is you we have to thank for Fjorn's demise?While it's true that you have aided us in our time of need, there is still much that must be done to repair our relations with Thorim.For now, I shall allow Njormeld to reforge the armor we gifted to the Stormlord so many ages ago. Consider it payment for your assistance against Fjorn.Njormeld was sent to recover Fjorn's anvil. You should find him there.12967Snorri was once the pride of our nation. A mighty warrior, many an enemy fell to his club.We honor him, though he's no longer what he once was. Age has taken its toll, dulling his senses and sapping his strength. Still, he remains as proud as ever, never missing an opportunity to join a battle.Speaking of battle, we're cooling Fjorn's anvil so it can be taken home. The remaining fire revenants are putting up some resistance. Help Snorri relive his glory days, . Guide him against this enemy.12968The witch that started it all, Yulda the Stormspeaker came to our very village.  She dared to insult our noble traditions and spouted the Lich King's venomous promises of power.She ought to have left with a sword through her, but her magic was strong and she managed to escape.Seek her in Valkyrion inside the largest dwelling and show her that we are not to be trifled with.12969I trust that's the green little one you've been looking for.  If I were you I'd step in before that Hyldnir splits him in half.You've arrived in the middle of the Hyldsmeet, so all challenges must be accepted by participants.  There's nothing to stop you from taking your green friend's place.12970Whether you've noticed or not, by defeating your first Hyldnir in hand-to-hand combat, you've entered the Hyldsmeet -- the great competition of Hyldnir against Hyldnir to determine who will rule by Thorim's side.The Hyldsmeet is the reason why I was imprisoned, for I sought to partake in the competition but was far too old and frail to be a match for the Hyldnir.If you're willing to listen, I've a proposal for you.12971Let's get you started.  The good news is that by defeating Agnetta, you've earned yourself a spot in the next round of matches.The bad news is that all your opponents will also have defeated someone in the first round.  Do not expect pushovers.12972You've succeeded in the first rounds of the Hyldsmeet.  To advance further, you're going to need a warbear of your own.Unfortunately, the Hyldnir don't give them out to just anyone.  You'll have to emerge victorious from true battle, not just gladiatorial combat.The Hyldnir of Brunnhildar are currently involved in a feud against the Sons of Hodir, Thorim's former allies.  Speak to Brijana just outside the village and see how you can help them and prove yourself in the process.12973That does it! We finally have the keystone... It's beautiful! I've been around the world more than once, but this thing's got me all jittery with excitement again. I suppose now's not the time to stop and admire though, we need to get the heck out of here.Hop on my flying machine and help keep us covered from those iron dwarves on the way out!12974Pfft, what happens down here ain't fightin'. It's a couple of guys dancin' around a flag.You lookin' for some real action, buddy? 'Cause if you are I got the hottest ticket in town.Ever heard of Gurgthock and Wodin? Goblin and troll who ran the Ring of Blood back in Outland? Well they're here in Northrend and they've started up a whole new fight club over in Zul'Drak. If you're interested go to Zul'Drak, east of Crystalsong. They're at the big arena in the center. Tell 'em Shifty sent ya!12975Surely Thorim has told you of the tragedy that divides us.It was in Thunderfall, northeast of here, that these events unfolded. The frozen fossils there are a reminder of that dark day, as are the spirits that haunt that place.If my people are to forgive Thorim, something must take the place of those images. A memorial must be constructed to bring our hearts peace.Go there, . Collect the fragments of Hodir's Horn that was shattered that day.12976Bring these fragments to Njormeld. He will use the pieces of that sacred relic in the construction of a mighty monument.May it soothe the pains and heal the scars my people have borne these many years.May its presence help to bring about a new age that sees us once again in glorious battle at Thorim's side.Go now, . Njormeld awaits you.12977You have done a great service to the giants of Dun Niffelem. Without your aid, this monument would not exist.As you silently ponder its significance, feelings begin to flood your heart. The feelings fill your mind with thoughts and images... as well as a sense of urgency.The sensations fade and leave you with a knowledge of what you must do. The restless spirits at Thunderfall must be put to rest.As you set off, you find that your hands have been filled with an ethereal horn.12978Like Bouldercrag, I once served the keepers as a craftsman in Ulduar, but with Loken's betrayal, I turned my hammer toward our new foes.When we could spare the men, I led raids on Nidavelir to relieve the pressure on our defenders, but our lines are near collapse.You've proven yourself a capable combatant and a staunch ally. Perhaps you'd be willing to take up our banner and take the fight to Nidavelir, the iron dwarf stronghold to the southwest, across the Snowdrift Plains.12979This armor plate is thick and oversized compared to the rest of the golem's defenses. A quick examination of the golem's corpse reveals that this heavier plate seems to have been bolted on as an afterthought or a crude upgrade.Why would the iron dwarves have added this redundant and mismatched armor to their war golems?Perhaps Bruor Ironbane would know if he had the chance to examine several of these plates from stormforged war golems.12980The presence of that armor plate is disorienting, but we need to find out all we can from it. It could be part of one of Valduran's schemes.He's dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort to mining, refining, smithing, and testing this metal.To the east, along the northern mountain face, is a building called Mimir's Workshop. It hasn't been used in quite some time, but if we're lucky, some of its attendants are still functional. Take your armor plate there and learn what you can from it.12981As you stare at the anvil you relive your recent accomplishments, particularly those which brought this artifact to rest here.It suddenly occurs to you that more remains to be done. To the east, smoldering scraps clutter the landscape - shrapnel from the battle fought there.If they could be cooled and gathered somehow, the frost giants would have an abundant supply of metal and the region would be cleared of these remnants of war.12982Now that I'm back, I'm certain that the baron will want me to recover my men. I can see that we're barely hanging on here. The Lich King's forces are about to break through and we won't be able to hold without my captured death knights.Can you assist me once more, ?Go back to Jotunheim and let them out of those cages. Break the damn locks, I don't care what you have to do. The vrykul likely have the keys.Just get my men free!12983For as long as I can remember, we've obtained our best bears from the Hibernal Cave to the east.Those times might finally be gone.  The cave has been overrun by ravenous jormungar and the wild bears are all but extinct.If you were to find a surviving matriarch, however, I would guarantee you that she would fight better than any of these bears born in captivity.Take this harness to the Hibernal Cave and rescue a surviving matriarch.  Good luck finding one.12984We have no choice, . What you learned in Mimir's Workshop means that we must act before Valduran can complete and unleash his new weapon.Even now, the refuge's defenders fight to buy us time to deal with Valduran the Stormborn.You must go to Nidavelir, across the Snowdrift Plains to the southwest, and then find and face Valduran. But you will not be alone. Bring this war horn with you and sound it as you prepare to face the leader of our enemies. Bruor and I will aid you in this battle.12985Greetings, .I have a task that King Jokkum felt you would be suited for, assuming you still strive to gain favor with our people.I have developed plans for another artifact, one that will grant Hodir's blessing of protection to our stronghold. I have nearly all that I require for its construction. All that remains to collect are the very eyes of our fallen enemies.Take this tool, and gather the eyes from the iron giant corpses that litter our fields.12986Norgannon's Core is not at this location. I am not sure why you seek it, , and I am equally unsure if you truly know the purpose of that which you seek.I would like you to aid me before I consider extending my assistance.  I have recently encountered knowledge of the watcher, Thorim. His seat of power is contested, and his fate remains to be seen. This troubles me, for I do not know of the other watchers. Utilize this databank to examine their temples to the northeast and return the knowledge to me.12987The helm is forged.Your efforts have not gone unnoticed, small one. Though there remains much to do, we sons of Hodir are grateful for your accomplishments.In return, I offer you the opportunity to present Hodir's helm to our king and our brethren.Fly to the sparkling tip of the small ice spike in front of me and read to our people from this tablet.Enjoy the privilege, . Never before has an outsider been given such an honor!12988In my folly, I'd thought Valduran's project at Narvir's Cradle, a large construction area to the south, no more than a grotesque monument to \"Keeper\" Loken's cruelty.Now we know the truth, that it was meant to be used as a weapon against us and our allies. We must not allow this iron colossus to reach completion, , for it will mean the end of the refuge.Go to Narvir's Cradle, find the lightning forges the stormforged artisans use, and sabotage them.12989The vile jormungar have taken over most of the Hibernal Cavern.  They are despicable beings... children of Loken, Thorim's scumsucker of a brother.As Thorim's servants we owe it to ourselves to kill these scum where we find them.  You'll find the cavern just east of here, outside the village.12991Bouldercrag's got a good plan to stymie the efforts of the iron dwarves at Narvir's Cradle, and I've got an idea of my own. Work on the iron colossus will come to a halt without any artisans.Narvir's Cradle is on the south side of the hill sheltering Bouldercrag's Refuge. Go there and slay any stormforged artificers in your path. They may be no different from what we once were, but they build a weapon that threatens us all.12992Dem vrykuls at the Jotunheim needs to be crushed! crush dems good!12993You've done an excellent job of delaying the work on the iron colossus, but I fear we've only made the stormforged more determined to complete the weapon.Even now, they're bringing in new laborers and the overseers push them to the limit. We may not be able to keep them from bringing the colossus online, after all. Return to Narvir's Cradle, to the south and find the documents detailing the colossus' offensive and defensive abilities. They should be near the tents and forges on the bottom level.12994The rapport you've developed with the inhabitants of Dun Niffelem has yielded some unexpected discoveries.For example, you somehow find yourself able to understand the denmother's guttural growls and sharp quips - at least you think you do.It would seem that she senses danger outside the stronghold and wants you to do something about it.With her forepaw, she removes the chain from around her neck and lets it drop at your feet. As you pick it up you notice an aged fang attached to it....12995We must attack the vrykul of Jotunheim on many levels. Brute force, of course, is good, but I prefer a more cerebral approach.I want you to demoralize them.My men here have forged a number of banners for you. I would like for you to take and plant them near the corpses of fallen vrykul.Let the banners serve as a constant reminder to them that they face a more immediate threat than the wrath of the Lich King.12996You've been very fortunate, sister.  This is a matriarch the likes of which hasn't been seen in years.A good bear won't do you much good without the skill to ride it.I'm going to have you practice some moves on Kirgaraak.  He's the largest yeti we've ever managed to capture so be careful.  Don't be afraid to walk away if he gives you a beating... there's a reason why we keep him chained.12997Besting a tethered opponent is one thing.  Fighting other bear riders on equal footing is another.Head into the Pit of the Fang and use what you've learned to defeat your opponents.  Good luck, sister.Glory awaits, should you succeed.12998According to the documents you captured at Narvir's Cradle, the iron colossus is complete except for one key component -- the Heart of the Storm.Without it, the iron colossus' weapons would be much weaker than the design predicts. If we can deny Overseer Narvir the heart, we could defeat the colossus!Notes on the documents you found say that the heart is in Uldis, a titan facility far to the south. Its entrance is on the south side of a tall mountain overlooking the Bor's Breath River.12999You remember Lady Nightswood, don't you? She certainly remembers you. She's the forlorn and very angry banshee that you 'saved' when you also broke Vile and myself out from under the Lich King's dominion.The lady has gone into Jotunheim and possessed their bone witch. She intends to wreak havoc upon the vrykul from within.She has asked that you seek her out. You'll find her in the cave on the south side of Njorndar Village to the southwest within Jotunheim.13000The cold in these mountains is brutal.  We have a day or two before we burn up all the wood from the wreckage.We spotted worgs inside a cave directly east of here.  I need you to find the cave and obtain some furs.  It might not sound like much, but it might be the difference between freezing to death and living another day.Worgs don't hunt alone, so I'm giving you a flare.  It should buy you some time if you find yourself outnumbered.13001The time has come, little . The stars have foretold of this day.I have received a vision from mighty Hodir himself, revealing the secret to the creation of a great artifact.We must obey! Were we to fail in receiving this gift, doom would surely follow.I call upon you to assist me in this sacred undertaking.Go across the valley, deep into the Hibernal Cavern and gather everfrost shards from the icy crater there, then collect hides from the mammoths outside the cavern.13003Hodir's Spear is an icon of great prowess in battle.Its mere presence instills a deep hunger for glory in all who enter Dun Niffelem. In fact, simply being near it has compelled you to test your own abilities.Scanning the horizon, your vision locks on a wild wyrm as it flies nearby.It is decided. Of you and he, only one shall see the next sunrise....13005For years I neglected my duties, giving into defeat and self-pity.Not the brave earthen, however.  Their oath to protect these grounds with their lives has gone unbroken.Even now, they fight the corruption of iron with selflessness, waiting for the moment in which the tides turn.That moment has arrived.  We must rally what remains of the earthen defenders and lead them into a glorious victory.  Sound the Horn of the Peaks to call them to your side and take back the Terrace of the Makers.13006As you draw near the helm, you notice that the frigid environment is already taking its toll on the artifact's surface. What is now just a thin layer of ice will surely grow to envelop it entirely.Not about to let your hard efforts go to waste, you resolve to scour the region in search of a solution.Just as you set off, the eyes of the helm flash and an image of the nearby Hibernal Cavern enters your mind.13007We have failed to prevent the completion of the iron colossus, , which means we have no choice but to face it in battle.Bruor has devised a plan to exploit the colossus' only weakness.No matter how tough the colossus' armor is, it is still vulnerable to a jormungar's acid. Take control of one using the orbs along the northern edge of the Snowdrift Plains, then use it to fight the Iron Colossus on the Snowdrift Plains. If you need help controlling the creature, speak to one of the nearby handlers.13008We had the element of surprise on our side! We blew a hole in the side of the mountain and charged into Scourgeholme. Scourge opposition was fierce and it wasn't long until we were overwhelmed. We fell back to the valley and began raining artillery down on the Scourge that followed. This held them back for awhile until... Those monsters began using crusaders as living shields. We had to stop shelling for fear of killing our own soldiers.Free our crusaders trapped on the field outside the base, !13009It remains uncertain whether or not our people can ever rekindle the affection we once held for Thorim.May this armor, if nothing else, remind him of the days when we stood together in honor, invincible.13010One task remains before I can reclaim my home at the Terrace of the Makers.Krolmir must be found.On that fateful day, I threw it to the earth with all the power and rage I possessed. A mighty explosion followed.I've thought it lost for these many years, but now I must be certain.Return to King Jokkum and discover what, if anything, he knows of my hammer's fate.13011I have an opportunity that will help you to gain approval with my people, provided you prevail.The jormungar are a nuisance best dealt with quickly. If given any quarter, they breed like hares and spread like fire.They have appeared southwest of here, in the Hibernal Cavern. If their spawnmother is not slain soon, they will gain a foothold in our region.She cannot refuse food. Take this knife and get the flank of a bear corpse from their cave.

There, Wind Tamer Barah told me the tale of Stormhoof and his battle against the North Wind, their people's ancient enemy.I set out for the Storm Peaks to learn more of this hero, but strangely, the people of Tunka'lo seem to know nothing of him.Perhaps the camp's own records will give us greater insight. Find and read the history scrolls kept throughout the camp, then tell me what you learned.13035The attack on the Terrace of the Makers was not a half-hearted move on my brother's behalf.  He sent a legion of iron dwarves and some of his most powerful lieutenants.Use the Horn of the Peaks to call the earthen to your side and defeat Loken's servants.You'll find the giant, Eisenfaust, inside the Hall of the Shaper to the north.  You'll find the others deeper inside the Terrace of the Makers, beyond the stairs to the northwest.13036Long has been the path to our salvation, young . We have fought across continents, worlds even, to reach this point. Now we face our greatest challenge: the destruction of the Lich King and his Scourge.Alas, we fight this battle divided. The Horde and Alliance are in the throes of war and will lend us no support. We must remain unyielding in our cause! For what choice have we to do otherwise?Do you join the cause? Lend us your strength, ! My commander, Entari, awaits you at his post.13037When the bronze dragonflight gifted me with immortality and set me on the path of the witness, Nozdormu entrusted me with the Lorehammer.The hammer's reaction to your findings means that time has gone awry here and it is our duty to restore the true timeline.We must find it. To the northwest is Frostfloe Deep, ancient burial cave of the warriors of Tunka'lo. Seek out the spirit of Chieftain Swiftspear, Stormhoof's brother. Ask him what he remembers of his brother's battle against the North Wind.13038This, the tomb of Tunka'lo's warriors, is supposed to be a serene place, free from the terror of the elements.Frostfloe Deep has been invaded by a strange force, one that disturbs the spirits of the fallen and blurs my memories of my own life.It's as though our deeds and memories are being erased from history.In life, this totem was a symbol of my authority. It is the last true link I have to this world. Take it, use it to restore calm to the tomb, and then return it to Camp Tunka'lo.13039We can't keep this pace up, . Once the breach was blown, the floodgates opened up. The Scourge have been pourin' through ever since with no end in sight!We need every able bodied man and woman to help keep the tide of evil at bay. Get out there and do yer share, friend. Kill as many of those monsters as ye can!13040The number of injured soldiers rises with each passing day. They are being stricken by some type of toxin that we have never before seen. Whatever it is that these Nerubians hold within their venom glands is lethal and incurable! So far we've only been able to slow down the poison flowing through the victim's bodies. We must devise a cure!Venture northwest to the valley outside of the Vanguard and slay the Forgotten Depths Nerubians. Recover their venom glands and bring them to me.13041I'm glad you showed up!   A shipment of Glowing Ivory Figurines needs to go out to Undermine right now, and I am still short a Chalcedony to complete an eye for the last one.Bring me one and a Dalaran Jeweler's token will be yours.13042Deep in the bowels of The Underhalls to the northeast, a mad scientist known as Dr. Terrible is up to something befitting his name.The doctor has been given dispensation by the Lich King to perform experiments upon the vargul -- the vrykul who fall in battle and are found unworthy, and then turned into Scourge.We must put an end to his work, but my auguries have been unable to find him. He does, however, have an assistant.Beat the information out of his apprentice, and then dispose of the body.13043Opening the tome, you notice all manner of disgusting illustrations concerning the construction of what the doctor refers to as \"the ultimate weapon\"!Clearly the prototype, Nergeld, is the massive flesh giant standing still at the end of the nearby Hall of Horrors.If an army of those things were to be constructed, then it would mean doom. The only way to ensure that doesn't happen is to slay Dr. Terrible!Perhaps if you were to take control of the construct, the doctor would reveal himself?13044Across the Valley of Echoes, west of here, and through the Breach, is the first Scourge encampment in Icecrown known as Scourgeholme. We fought a good fight at Scourgeholme and killed many Scourge, but in the end we were forced to retreat. Many soldiers were left behind - their fate unknown.If there are survivors, we must attempt a rescue. Directly down this southeastern path is Penumbrius, ally of the bronze dragonflight and caretaker of the proto-brood. Seek him out and ask for his assistance.13045We will do all that we can to assist you, . The proto-brood have volunteered to fly you across the Breach and into Scourgeholme. Rescue any captured Argent Crusaders that you find. Return them immediately to the Vanguard Infirmary, located at the center of this base.Choose one of the Argent Skytalons in the pen behind me and go!Scourgeholme is located northwest, across the Valley of Echoes, through the great Breach.13046Arngrim's hunger was legendary.Even in death, his expression is one of famished yearning. You find that just looking at him is making your stomach growl.It is said that throughout his life he was never truly sated, and that there was absolutely nothing he wouldn't eat. You wonder to yourself if there might be a way to feed the old king.No sooner does the thought enter your mind than one of the massive frozen teeth falls from Arngrim's head, bounces off of his beard and lands in your hand.13047Loken killed my wife, turned my followers and me against each other.  He took away everything I had, but today... that changes.Today we reclaim our sacred grounds.  Today... Loken dies.Meet me on the bridge near the Temple of Wisdom, just southwest of Ulduar.  I will finish this one way or the other.I need you there as a witness.  You will not aid me -- this is personal.After it's done, send word to Jokkum, King of the Frost Giants.  He's a good friend and will know what to do.13048The Lorehammer can help us correct the damage to the timeline, but only if we can discover where the history was originally corrupted.From Chieftain Swiftspear and your findings at Frostfloe Deep, we know that the change happened around the time of Stormhoof's death.Now, you must go to the Howling Hollow, north of the camp, and inspect the gravesites the North Wind's minions have already destroyed. The Lorehammer will react to artifacts from Stormhoof's era and attune itself to the proper time.13049Not all of the camp's records have yet been corrupted. My staff has helped me to find those records which reflect the true timeline.They agree that Stormhoof was given a burial of honor among the village elders on the bottom level of the Howling Hollow, to the north.Most of the graves there have already been destroyed, their contents taken as trophies by the North Wind's subjects. Go to the hollow and see if you can recover Stormhoof's spear and armor from the scions of storm who have claimed them.13050If I'm to launch an attack against my brother's army, I'm going to need some way to get around.I released my riding drake back into the wild years ago.  Veranus was magnificent.  The leader of her own brood -- to whom she has now returned.Finding her will be hard, but perhaps there's a way.  She keeps her old empty nest out of pure pride.  She's a broodmother in name only, for she is beyond the age of breeding.Bring me small eggs from the other nests near Brunnhildar.  I think I've an idea.13051Veranus is proud like no other beast I've known.  She still keeps her old nest and makes sure none of the younger proto-drakes takes it over.Take the eggs you've collected and place them on her nest.  You'll find it atop a small peak, directly southeast of here.I should be able to get control of her before she kills you in a fit of rage.  Hopefully.13054I can't in good conscience send you to the worg cave without warning you that the previous person we sent there hasn't returned.We're prepared for the worst, but perhaps there's a chance that he's alive.  We'd appreciate it if you helped him return -- Tracker Val'zij is one of the only hunters we have.13055It's good to see a friendly face.  Might be the last one I see.One of those jormungar stung me with some sort of toxin before I managed to get away.  I can feel my whole body getting numb, mon.I'm going to need a toxin gland to make an antidote.  I will also need some of the cave mushrooms that grow here... they'll slow the toxin down.Hurry, please.  I don't have much time.13056I should manage for now, .  There is one favor I'd like to ask, though.I would never had fallen to one of these worms, but my wind serpent, Heesha, was killed by the meanest worg I've seen in some time.Don't worry about me now, I'll feel better when that worg is breathing no more.  You should find him deeper in the cave.13057It is time, .  I am prepared to face Loken now.Let us make our way to the Terrace of the Makers and face my brother's forces.  The fool will regret ever crossing me.13058At last, we have all that we need to right the wrongs of the North Wind and its followers. You have attuned the Lorehammer to Stormhoof's time and his persona.Take the hammer again, head to the Temple of Life in the plains to the northwest. Use the hammer to assume the role of Stormhoof. Face the North Wind as Stormhoof, but realize that for the timeline to be restored, Stormhoof must die as the North Wind weakens.Then, you must find and use the Horn of Elemental Fury to destroy the North Wind.13059I've been praying to The Lady of the Sword for one to come and strike down my enemy. Thane Illskar must pay for what he did to me!I was the champion of Thane Ufrang the Mighty. During my fight for ascendance in Valhalas, Illskar sabotaged me with dark magic, causing me to lose and be reduced to this.The thane and his champions can be found below in The Circle of Suffering. Challenge him on my behalf. Defeat him.Make him know the suffering that I know!13060So...  so I don't think we're going to be getting a good foothold in those mountains.Trust me, I'm not one to give up easily... but between freezing engines, nasty vrykul women, territorial dragon want-to-bes and the half a dozen other nasties settled in the area, this just ain't happening.Don't let that dissuade you though! Just because we can't get a foothold doesn't mean we won't get you there... one-way trips are pretty simple when you get down to it.13061This is it then.  I'll take care of your bear now, you won't be needing her.  The great Drakkensryd will be your next challenge.Say goodbye to your friends and leave your affairs in order, for you will return victorious... or you won't return at all.13062You've been a great ally, .

The many men of that allied force scattered, but Bridenbrad alone returned and dragged more than a dozen men to safety, one by one through the carnage., he has not returned since. He was spotted heading to the far northeast, towards the Silent Vigil. Bring him back to me that I might honor him for his valor.13069Jotunheim has aerial defenses, both in terms of proto-drake riders and harpoon guns. They've concentrated these on their northern and western facings where they are most vulnerable.Let's use their defenses against them!Take control of a harpoon gun on the platforms that overhang the cliffs on either side of Valhalas to the southwest. Take out the proto-drakes and their riders. Shoot 'em up!13070The chill of death stirs in the west, threatening to freeze our hearts and souls to this wasteland and bind us to its dark master.

I do not fear death itself, but I loathe to consider serving the traitor, Arthas.Leave me... and see to it that no one else comes looking. You would do me a great disservice if you were to expose anyone to the plague that I carry.13073There are those of this world that tap into power unrestricted by the bounds of our mortal frames - powers of restoration, powers of life, and powers of light.  And Bridenbrad, this is no ordinary man... his valor and devotion shine through.

His intimate knowledge of the Scourge will be invaluable in our effort.Go now and report to him at the tent outside of the Breach, northwest of here.13106The Scourge has a large facility called the Fleshwerks, dedicated to producing abominations and flesh giants. If we can shut it down, we can deprive the Lich King of a large component of his armies.I've sent Darkrider Arly to the area. She has a small base, Blackwatch, on a ridge overlooking the Fleshwerks and to the west of Corp'rethar. I'm told the Argent Crusade is sending someone to coordinate their efforts there, but the darkrider will know what to do.

More and more skeletal constructors keep appearing to increase the pace of work.If we do not discover where they're coming from and how they're able to work so quickly, we'll be overrun before we can act in force. Search to the southeast and see if you can find the source of these skeletons.13118The Scourge have sent their armies at the Argent Crusade and have been repelled. What they do now is called a 'slash and burn.' All prisoners that they hold at Scourgeholme will be executed and raised as servants of the Lich King.Undoubtedly the Argent Crusade will request that you give their soldiers a proper farewell. I'll ask no such thing of you. To succeed we must kill Scourge indiscriminately.Venture to Scourgeholme, northwest through the Breach, and lay waste to all that stand in your way.13119So they're summoning in their workers and warriors at those altars?They'll need to be the first thing to go. The master summoner should have a staff which allows him to activate the portal. If you kill the master summoner and take the staff, you can use it to overload the summoning portal and destroy its altar.Do this at all four of the altars and return to me once they've been destroyed.13120The Fleshwerks is a vast operation, and it will be difficult to keep an eye on all that transpires there. Fortunately, I have a plan.This is a death's gaze orb. With it, we can observe the Scourge's actions and decide how best to strike.Place these orbs on the stands at three crucial areas -- the abomination lab and the flesh giant lab to the southwest, along with the area surrounding the green cauldron far to the west.13121We must use the Lich King's tools against him if we are to decide our next step.Over the mountain to the southwest lies Kul'galar Keep. Within it reside the oracles of Jotunheim who receive orders from their master and scry upon others through the Eye of the Lich King.It is the eye that you must fight your way to. While it cannot be used to pierce the veil within Icecrown Citadel, you should be able to use it to discern something of value so that we will know how best to proceed.13122A Scourgestone is an item given to all Scourge upon birth or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it allows Scourge leaders visibility into the location and movement of all of their units.With enough Scourgestones, I might be able to track the movement of other Scourge units across Icecrown.As you slaughter Scourge in Scourgeholme, gather all of the Scourgestones that you find. Return to me when your bags are full.13124Malygos and his underlings grow stronger in power with each passing day. And now, our latest assault team has been captured and is being held in the Oculus.We must attempt a rescue! Belgaristrasz and his companions are invaluable to our cause.13125You must defeat the lords of Scourgeholme if this place is to be free of the Scourge's grasp.Salranax the Flesh Render lords over the temple on the first tier of Scourgeholme. Nearby Salranax you'll find High Priest Yath'amon preaching at the spirit tower on the second tier. Underking Talonox holds court at the Pit of Fiends, up the high road.These are formidable opponents and must be approached with caution. Use this war horn should you require aid. The death knights of Acherus will come.13126From here, it will take our combined efforts to proceed.Above us, Varos hides behind an impenetrable shield. To reach him, you must defeat the Centrifuge Constructs that power his shield.We can each provide you with drakes from our respective flights to help you reveal him.13127Only one obstacle stands between us and our ultimate goal here. His name is Urom.He guards the third ring above us. Beware his powerful conjurings, friend.Bring him down.

Use them wisely and Eregos shall surely fall.13129Here, , take this. Dip it in the remains of Novos the Summoner.We're going to figure out what makes the Scourge leaders tick.13130You may look at Scourgeholme now and see a rancid pit of decay, but one day it will be a place of glory and honor. Highlord Fordring has deemed it \"Justice Keep.\"Alas, even an impregnable fortress like Icecrown Citadel began with but a single stone. So begins our search for the stone to start a revolution.Travel to Crystalsong, south of here, and seek out the Unbound Thicket in the east. Once there gather crystalline heartwood from the thicket floor and elven masonry from the Ruins of Shandaral.13131Just look at it!

Wake them until you find Iskalder. When you do, use this amulet upon him and bring him back to me.Now go. There is no time to waste!13134The Scourge cannot create their flesh monsters without blood and embalming fluid to preserve the parts and keep them functioning. If we can deny them these materials, their army will fall apart and we can easily destroy their creations.Throughout the labs where the flesh giants and abominations are cobbled together, you will find vats of embalming fluid and large orbs filled with blood. Destroy these, and bring death to any who would stop you!13135Southeast of here, at the eastern reaches of Crystalsong Forest, is an area known as the Unbound Thicket. Within that thicket creeps all manner of life. One thing all of the affected creatures of the thicket share in common is their affinity for magical energy. Each of them holds pure, crystallized energy. Enough to kill us all should it ever destabilize!Travel to the Unbound Thicket and kill its denizens for crystallized energy. We need fuel and they need to die. We call that a \"win-win.\"13136You pulled this jagged, dark brittle shard from the body of a ghoul. The metal blade lacks a smooth edge, suggesting it was forged by an unskilled hand, or was broken from a larger piece.You recall seeing similar shards embedded in the bodies of all the ghouls you've encountered at the Fleshwerks, leading you to wonder why their creators bothered to include the metal at all. Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls.13137Atop the tallest peak to the southwest overlooking Jotunheim is Battlescar Spire. It is a place of reverence for the vrykul, second only to Valhalas in terms of where they prefer to do honorable combat.We shall visit not-so-honorable combat upon it.Gather your companions and fly to the spire. When you are ready, light the signal fire and I will appear within the body of Iskalder.We will fight, you will win, and Vardmadra is sure to come to witness the battle!13138These could pierce armor with enough force. We have to find out what they're made of and what the Lich King intends to do with them.To the east, nestled next to Icecrown Citadel itself, lies Malykriss. From the few reports we have, it's full of smelting and smithing equipment. Bring these shards there, and smelt them in one of the open furnaces on the bottom level of Malykriss. Once the metal has been reformed, we can identify it.13139Silas and Spitzpatrick have signed off on the materials and fuel needed to begin construction of Justice Keep. Thanks to you and the Ebon Blade the Scourge presence within Scourgeholme has been decimated and their lieutenants have been defeated.I have chosen the site at which we will break ground, but first you must deliver my report to Highlord Tirion Fordring. We will begin our march into Icecrown on his command.13140Those shards you recovered can only have come from one place, Malykriss. It's the seat of the Lich King's metalworking operations, to the east of Corp'rethar.What's puzzling is that metal isn't needed to stitch together abominations or flesh giants, or to summon skeletal servants. Find the skeletal runesmiths working on the bottom level of Malykriss and capture the plates they're working on. We need to find out why this metal is finding its way to the Fleshwerks.13141This banner is like no other, . It carries with it a powerful blessing, able to sanctify large tracts of blighted land.You must take it northwest, through the Breach, to an area the Scourge have mockingly named Crusaders' Pinnacle. Plant the banner atop the skulls of our fallen brethren at Crusaders' Pinnacle and defend it against attack. Once the land is sanctified, return to Father Gustav.Go now, . Hold no fear in your heart.13142The time has come, . You and your friends must challenge the lord of Balargarde Fortress, the master of Jotunheim, Overthane Balargarde.Atop the fortress, which is on the southwestern edge of Jotunheim, you will find a horn. Blow into it. Allow your challenge to resound throughout the steadfast.Balargarde will have no choice but to face you. And I... excuse me, Vardmadra will be there to adjudicate the challenge.13143First things first. I saw some Lithe Stalkers on the ramparts just east of us. They used to serve us before we broke with Arthas, and they're about as perfect a scout as you can get... with a little prodding from an eye of dominion.Fly up, find one of the stalkers, beat it down a bit, and then use this Sigil of the Ebon Blade to command its obedience. It will recognize the sigil, guaranteed. Lead it back to the top of the rocks northeast of here and it will find its way to me.13144The workers in the Fleshwerks abomination lab have already completed a number of their creations. For now, the creatures are chained to the pillars around the edge of the lab, but if we do not act, they will march with the Lich King's armies.Grasping arms reach out of the bone piles spread throughout the Fleshwerks. These arms belong to skeletons enchanted with the power of fire. Find and free these skeletons, then take them near the completed abominations and watch the show!13145We need to know what we're up against.Use the eye of dominion to assume control of a lithe stalker and scout out the area. There are a few spots in particular I saw when flying in that I want you to get a closer look at: the overlook in the northeast, the work area in the southeast, the large forge near the center, and the ritual area in the southwest.The stalker can leap far and won't be hurt by large falls - use that to your advantage to get up and down from those ramparts.13146We need to cause some disruption to bring those death knights away from their leaders. If we lay waste to their minions below, I suspect they'll have to devote more attention to keeping a close eye on operations.Abominations are easy prey - slow, predictable, and most importantly, stupid. Take advantage of their trust of the stalkers to drag them near some of the Scourge bombs scattered throughout the construction area. You'll be able to light the bombs far before they figure out what's going on.13147The major difference between vargul and lesser undead minions is that vargul still possess enough of their minds to despise being used for labor. Never will a vargul be pleased to be working aside skeletons or ghouls.Lets take advantage of this inevitable animosity and start some fights between the umbral brutes and the other undead in Malykriss. That should serve to slow production and bring the death knights down to babysit.Should be simple - throw rocks at the brutes as they near lesser undead.13148This damaged necklace has an invoice with it that reads \"Property of Timothy Jones - Cartier and Co Fine Jewelry - Magus Commerce Exhange - Dalaran\".Perhaps you should repair it and return it to him.13149The infinite dragonflight seek to disrupt history by deceiving Prince Arthas.If they can convince him that none of the grain here carries the plague, then he'll never have to make the fateful decision to cull Stratholme.Use this arcane disruptor on any suspicious crates of grain you find.13151Arthas will soon face a desperate dilemma, and make a momentous decision.I must call upon you to accompany the prince in his culling.Arthas must make it through Stratholme alive and you must see to it that he defeats Mal'Ganis!13152So they've been embedding these ghouls with broken shards of saronite down in the Sanctum of Reanimation? We must put a stop to this, before these ghouls can be deployed against our troops.Find the entrance to the Sanctum of Reanimation in the flesh giant lab area of the Fleshwerks. There, the ghoul mastermind, Doctor Sabnok, keeps the most fearsome of his creations, Patches. Free Patches from his chains and help him take his revenge on the doctor. Let his own creation be his undoing.13153, good to see you. While the battle has subsided for now, we must hurry and replenish our stocks. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been seen collecting armor in the area.Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me.If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.13154Dragons are incredible! Well, their bones at least! I've been equipping our archers with arrowheads made of Dragonbone. Unfortunately, since the massacre at Angrathar, it has become almost impossible to get bone from Dragonblight.However, the Forest of Shadows on the western edge of Wintergrasp has enough bones to tide us over.Head to the Forest of Shadows and bring back any bone splinters you can find!The Horde have been seen collecting bone splinters in the area. Slay them!13155I've already heard some rumors regarding Malykriss and Arthas's new death knight order, but I assumed it nothing more than filling the void. These numbers suggest he's trying to take it up a notch though.We dispatched one of our best to Malykriss not long ago - Vereth the Cunning. You should be able to find him on the Rise of Suffering, just west of Malykriss, and inside the Court of Bones.Try not to draw too much attention on your way in.13156My, it its quite chilly up here! Reminds me of the stormy peaks of Kaarinos on Argus. However, with all of this snow and ice, our soldiers can easily catch cold.Head to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp, and bring me back 10 of the Horde herb pouches you find. I will grind them into a medicine to help protect against the cold.The Horde have been seen collecting them from the plant life in the area. Do not hesitate to slay them and retrieve the herbs!13157Stand proud in knowing that it was you who helped establish the Argent Crusade inside the walls of Icecrown, . The Crusaders' Pinnacle now stands in direct defiance of the Lich King and his twisted minions.Highlord Fordring and the crusaders who survived await your arrival at Crusaders' Pinnacle. Travel once more through the Breach and seek out the highlord!13160Gargoyles make effective scouts and can be deadly if left to rain attacks from the air, but they have a very obvious weakness. Most of them have to go through long periods resting as stone to maintain the energy they need to carry their heavy bodies through the air.As I peered through the eye you were using, I noticed dozens of iceskin sentries resting on the eastern and southern walls inside. Use the stalker to leap up to their ledges and devastate them while they sleep.13161It's time that we start cutting off the heads of the beast.I served beside Rokir for quite some time. He knows the unholy arts better than most any other death knight I've met and he's equally as ruthless.Rokir's strengths are most apparent when you are fighting him on his own ground. Sadly, we don't have much option in those regards, but stay on your feet to avoid his undead minions and you should come out victorious.Be nimble, , and do not take him lightly.13162Sapph... Sapph's a death knight like no other. She'll shower you with sweet words and you'll swear that she has no evil within her heart, and then she'll run you through without even breaking her smile.I have no fear that you'll be able to best Sapph, but do not grow overconfident. Her strength lies in lulling her victims into a false ease, shortly before shattering them with a fierce barrage of frost attacks.Do not let your guard down, and do not underestimate her.13163Baelok is one of the few vrykul that I've ever seen rise through the ranks, and that was mostly accomplished through sheer brutality. If your competition ends up dead, there's far less to compete against.When you join battle with him, spread out from your companions and keep your distance as much as you reasonably can. He will not hesitate to steal your life force for himself, so you will need to hinder his ability to do so as much as possible.You have my confidence. See to it that he dies.13164With the riders of the Host of Suffering dead, now is the time to put an end to their true leader: Orbaz Bloodbane.Mograine caught up with me while you were off and told me that he found where Orbaz is hiding. Under Icecrown Citadel itself, there is an immense pit - you will find Orbaz just outside its lip.Some of the Ebon Blade's strongest agents have already been dispatched - gather aid and join the fight. It is time for Bloodbane to die.13165The haze has been lifted. I can see as clearly now as the day that I plunged the Ashbringer into my own heart to free my father's cursed soul: my last memory as a free man.We must take back Acherus from the Scourge if our order is to survive in this new world. I have taught you how to call forth a death gate. The death gate will return you to Acherus when you call upon it, . Use it now and meet me at Acherus. The first battle of the Knights of the Ebon Blade is underway! Death to the Scourge!13166The Hall of Command has been secured, but the Lich King has left us a little present in the Heart of Acherus. The stitched terror, Patchwerk, and a horde of abominations have taken over the second floor.Use the teleporter to get to the second floor and destroy the Scourge forces that remain. Do not engage Patchwerk alone! You must fight the monstrosity with other death knights of Acherus!Go, . You have my strength to carry you!13168Look what we have here... eyes of dominion. The Cult normally goes to great lengths to keep these things safe, but I suppose their options for retreat are few when we're slaughtering them in their own home.The eyes allow a being of any relative power to control an undead minion's actions precisely. As you can imagine, this can be extremely useful when it comes to your typical clumsy ghoul or skeleton.Care to try your hand at it? Use one of the eyes to control a captured shade.13169As is usual practice, the undead at the saronite quarry to the southwest starve plaguehounds to keep them extra aggressive. Use the shade to get up close and feed some of those hounds and I promise you they'll be content to leave you alone, if not side with the hand that fed them.Don't get too close to those things until you've fed them though. Their noses don't fall victim to your shade's elusiveness.13170Ghouls are fragile things when it comes down to it, and the lookouts at the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest are no exception. Using one of the shades, I have no doubt that you can sneak up and put down their lookouts without making a sound.Clear out as many lookouts as you can reach in a reasonable amount of time... we'll want their ranks thinned for our assault to come.13171My main concern is the saronite quarry down the path to the southwest. They are pulling up immense amounts of ore from that quarry and I'd like to know what they're building with it. To that end, we'll start by weakening their defenses.I noticed a series of crystals scattered throughout the base and I assume they are defensive structures of some sort, not unlike ziggurats. Use the eidolon watcher to destroy any of those crystals that you find.13172Effective tool, is it not? Excellent job weakening their defenses, . Now we can push the main assault.The plan here is straight-foward - we're looking to destroy anything moving, and get in there and steal some information amidst the confusion.Let me know when you're ready and I'll set you up with a skeletal gryphon.13174Shutting down their operation is just half of the plan. The other important goal here is to find out where all that saronite is being sent. We know of a few places it's been ending up, but the amount they're pulling out suggests to me that there's a bigger project in the works.Once you're inside the quarry, get your hands on any of their documents that you can find. If you're assaulting the place with one of the gryphons, you can drop down from it as soon as the wetwork is done.131751317613177Welcome to the Wintergrasp Fortress, .

Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in southeastern Wintergrasp and retrieve several eternal embers.The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolisher and Siege Engines. Oh, and if you happen to see some of the Horde in the Cauldron, don't hesitate to slay them and take their embers. We must prevent them from holding the keep!13198, good to see you. We must prepare for our next assault on the fortress. My research indicates that the armor of soldiers recently slain in the Glacial Falls becomes imbued with an incredible amount of energy. The Horde has been collecting armor in the area.Head to the Glacial Falls and slay any of the Horde you find there. Return their imbued armor to me.If you cannot find any of the Horde, you might find the armor of an adventurer slain by the elementals.13199Why would they set me to the task of arming our archers? I was a poet, not a ranger! Well, no use complaining. , I am in need of dragon bone for our arrowheads.Travel to the Forest of Shadows on the western side of Wintergrasp. Ever since the last skirmish, the Alliance have been scavenging dragon bones in the area. Slay them and take the bones.If that fails, you might be lucky and get one from the spirits in the area. I hear they love to impale their living victims on the bones as they die.13200Lok'tar, ! While the battle may have subsided, we must prepare to retake the fortress! Travel to the Cauldron of Flames in south eastern Wintergrasp and retrieve ten eternal embers.The embers are mixed in with coal to fuel the Demolishers and Siege Engines. We've heard reports of Alliance pigs collecting the embers all day. Slay them and take their embers! If they have already abandoned the area, then be prepared to fight the fire elementals there until you find some!13201So many of our braves were lost during the battle, but even more shall die if left untreated. Travel to the Steppe of Life in southwestern Wintergrasp. I have need of the roses that grow there for salve to treat the wounded.Sadly, the rose has become scarce due to the Alliance harvesting it too rapidly. Slay them on the Steppe of Life and retrieve their herb pouches from the bodies.If that fails, perhaps a lasher or two might be in bloom.13202Hey 'mon.

This must stop!The dead are heroes who fell in defense of all the living, and they cannot be confined to so grisly a fate. Moreover, we cannot afford to face them again on the field, used as weapons against us. Take this torch with you to the Fleshwerks, and burn any of the corpses you find in the Sanctum of Reanimation or the abomination lab.13212With the abduction of Crusader Olakin, the Argent Crusade's forces will have no commander in the final assault on the Fleshwerks. While one crusader is the same as any other to me, the argents won't see it that way.I hate to see us waste time chasing after this, but I have no choice. Our gallant crusader has likely been dismembered by now, and his remains used to construct abominations. Go down into the Fleshwerks, kill the corpulent horrors fighting our forces, and recover Olakin's body parts.13213I see and hear many things, , and something very important has happened since your defeat of Overthane Balargarde: you are wanted for battle in Valhalas!You will find the battle pit to the north. Go now with your friends and speak with Geirrvif the val'kyr. The challengers that she will offer you within Valhalas are sure to require their help.Good luck.13214If you believe yourself ready to begin then I have just the match for you to cut your teeth on.Another group of outsiders thought themselves prepared for the rigors of Valhalas. They had much hubris, but in the end they fell like all of the others.If you think yourselves so different -- if you think that you have the skill and experience to fight here amongst such storied warriors -- then please accept the challenge.13215A variety of beings travel the world to prove themselves within Valhalas. Some even come from under the world.Khit'rix the Dark Master is one such.Hailing from deep within the ground where insanity reigns, Khit'rix has asked for someone exotic to face in the ring. You will do.Dare you face this Nerubian nightmare, ?13216An old foe of yours has returned: Sigrid Iceborn. Perhaps you remember besting her in a duel upon the Savage Ledge?No matter, she certainly remembers you. She's insisting upon a chance to prove herself once more.Personally, I think it's more a chance for revenge, but that too can be useful in this place.I leave it up to you, . Will you face Sigrid Iceborn once more?13217You've been successful up to this point, , but what you must face to continue to battle within Valhalas is a gigantic horror beyond imagining.I must warn you to turn away now. Carnage is a mountain of flesh constructed by the Lich King's most fiendish minds.I do not see how you and your friends will defeat it. However, the choice is yours.13218Your skills have not gone unnoticed by the vrykul of Jotunheim, . Thane Banahogg has taken a personal interest in you and has insisted that he be your next match.If you thought Carnage was bad, then you might want to go home now. Thane Banahogg's nickname is The Deathblow. I think you can guess how he earned it.Do you accept the thane's challenge?13219I'm afraid that your success is going to be your undoing, .Word of your success in Valhalas has reached deep into Icecrown Citadel, stirring one whom you have no desire to meet.Prince Sandoval himself is on his way at this very moment. Gjonner warned you that you should run and I cannot disagree.What will you do? He's on his way. Will you face the blood prince in final battle?13220We can't afford to waste any time putting Olakin back together. Fortunately, the Scourge has provided a perfect place for you to stitch him back together.Near the Fleshwerks' flesh giant lab is the Sanctum of Reanimation. Search the area for a spool of thread and the doctor's cleaver. Then, take Olakin's remains to the large slab in the middle of the sanctum and get to work.13221The Light smiles upon me. I have not yet died in this living nightmare, but the Scourge will kill me and tear my body apart for use in their 'work' here if I cannot escape.I cannot make it on my own, my child, but with your help, I may yet live to fight the Scourge again.Will you help me make my escape before the Scourge's butchers come to finish me off?13222Front and center, ! We're beginning our assault on Wintergrasp Fortress. Those Horde animals think they can hide cowardly behind their walls? Well, I think not! We'll show them the power of Gnomish technology and smash their walls to bits!However, even the most powerful siege device is helpless without a crew. Pilot or protect one of our siege vehicles as it destroys three of the Horde structures.13223Dem Alliance won't be long to hold that keep. Murp would smash walls, but Murp has to stay in camp. Murp wish he could smash Alliance who want to hurt Horde demolishers.You, ! You go in Murp's place. Protect 3 siege vehicles while they smash Alliance buildings. Alliance not expect you to defend demolisher. Show Alliance how smart Murp is!13224The Argent Crusade pulled my ravaged body from the Broken Front. What a glorious battle, . My axe sang as it cut down Alliance filth and Scourge alike.My time is over. It will be a good death. Carry a message for me, soldier.Our base flies out of reach of Scourge - overhead between Mord'rethar and Aldur'thar. It is called \"Orgrim's Hammer.\"Fly high and avoid the Alliance juggernaut, Skybreaker. Tell Korm... tell him I died... fighting... For the Horde.13225We were neck deep in Scourge and Horde. The screams of the dying covered that field. It was torturous... unrelenting!At some point my body gave out. I fell, only to be awoken by the Argent Crusade. They pulled me out of the Broken Front and brought me here. I'm not going to make it. Grant a dying soldier one last wish, ? Our base, the Skybreaker, flies high above Icecrown. It is there that you'll find my commanding officer, High Captain Bartlett. Tell him that I died a soldier of the Alliance.13226We cannot defeat the Lich King on our own. Divided we shall all fall!I implore you to answer the call, . The Argent Crusade accepts all who would volunteer to aid in the war effort.

Show no mercy... let none of them survive.For... the Horde...13231What?! Noooo!We went to such great pains to keep this attack secret. How could the Horde have known? The resources... the men... all lost? Inconceivable!Our plans here in Icecrown hinged upon our taking that gate before the Horde could. We must recover quickly and prepare to mount another offensive.Visit the battlefield and search for any survivors. See if there's anything to be learned from this tragedy.And prepare yourself, , for a war - on two fronts...13232They taunt us - even as they lie dying here...Please, ... Don't allow their mocking to be the last sounds I hear...Finish me... deliver me from this torment... into... the Light.Seek out  my companions... offer them the same mercy.Leave nothing for the Scourge to raise!I beg you...13233It is as I told you. They were not merely idle words spoken in a fit of anger.Time and again, the Horde have demonstrated their disdain for everything we hold dear and holy. They must pay with their lives for their transgressions against the light.All of them.Just imagine a world free of their stain, . Envision the joy our children will know. Think of the reverence your descendants will have for your memory, knowing they owe their happiness to you.Now go, and make that vision a reality!13234The time has come!Too long have we suffered the company of the self-righteous Alliance! Too long have we stayed our hand from cleansing our world of the weak and the desperate.Now, we bring an end to our humiliation! Now, we show them the true meaning of fear! Now, we bring honor to the Horde!Here, at Icecrown, we break the Alliance!Go, . Hunt them down. Break them. Take their will to live!13235You've done well in destroying the Fleshwerks and slaughtering the Lich King's servants. Now, all that remains is to defeat the Fleshwerks' greatest accomplishment -- the flesh giant known as Morbidus.It will not be an easy fight, but the Shadow Vault has dispatched Margrave Dhakar with some reinforcements. Meet up with him at the highest point at the western end of the Fleshwerks. Tell him when you're ready to begin the attack and he'll order his forces into battle.13236You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines.That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them.I saw the prince do it himself.  I can show you how it happened... if you'd like.13237While your commander has his focus diluted by his loathing of your Alliance rivals, you can depend on me to direct my attention squarely on the real enemy here - the Lich King and his minions.In order to hold any hope of conquering him at the citadel, your people must take and hold each gate.For now, let us focus on the first. Return to the front and prod their defenses. Look for any sign of weakness that we might exploit.I'll await your report, .13238Goblins! Hyper little busy-bodies...Listen, . Copperclaw, our resident engineer, is insisting that he's got something useful to show me.I'm in no mood to endure his squeaky nagging.

Let me know if indeed he's on to anything.13239Where to begin... well, you must know that as chief engineer of this vessel I have access to all of the intelligence reports - yes, yes, it's true, and I've recently taken a particular interest in the frostwyrms you reported seeing to the south, and I do believe I've developed a plan that just might work against them... now it'll take a little legwork on your part, but essentially, you build a dummy out of armor and coat it with a splash of this solution, then run for cover!...You still here, ?13258We recently came upon schematics that indicate a weakness in Icecrown Citadel.  An opening in its defenses, both figuratively and literally.The captured diagrams show an orifice leading several hundred feet into the ground.  We're unsure of its purpose, but our scouting has revealed it to be of high importance to the Scourge.Speak to Sergeant Kregga below Icecrown Citadel, she's leading the attack on the site.13259We've one shot at dealing some damage to this place -- let's make sure we get it right.We've acquired potent, Scourge-made, saronite bombs.  But we must secure this area before we can set them off.We're going to need to get the Scourge defenses under control quickly, before reinforcements arrive.Help my men out and come back when you're ready for some fireworks.13260While we should never miss an opportunity to strike out against the Alliance, we mustn't forget about the Scourge.We won't have the numbers here to make a proper assault in the glacier for weeks, but that won't keep us from learning all we can know about their defenses.I have asked our resident death knight to advise you in this effort. After all, who better knows this enemy than they?Allow me to introduce Koltira Deathweaver.13261Wahooo! It works! Not that I had any doubts in my supernatural ingenuity, only that I wasn't quite sure what kind of explosion to expect - let's just say I'm glad to see that you didn't get your eyebrows singed off. So now I just need to show ol' Korm how ya thaw out one 'a them wyrms. He'll hafta promote me to... to... to whatever comes after Chief Engineer! Here, you take another batch of the stuff and head back out to the front and I'll go get Korm...Well? Move out!13262This is probably as under-control as this situation is going to get.  Let's do this, .I need someone to light the fuse on those bombs and it looks like you're the one to do it.13263As you light the fuse, you notice that it is consumed by fire far quicker than you would expect.The bombs are about to go off and your best chance at surviving is to lean towards the pit and hope the fall doesn't kill you.13264Abominations...They can be a very capable enemy. I've seen them turn the tide of battle more than once. What few realize, is that they can also be very capable friends.They are not deep thinkers. If you know the secrets of their creation, you can issue them basic orders that they will not question.Fortunately for you, I know these secrets.This kit will reanimate the remains of the abominations you defeat.

You're not going to win against them like that.You can destroy hundreds... even thousands of them.  But you won't win.  Not out here.When you're done playing with your machine, meet me to the north.  There is an old army encampment.  What I will show you will teach you a little bit about who you're up against.13395You probably think you're quite strong -- fighting these undead and crushing their bones beneath your war machines.That is nothing compared to the strength it took to create them.I saw the prince do it himself.  I can show you how it happened... if you'd like.13396Do you see now?  Sending your men against the prince's armies just swells their numbers.I don't expect you to understand... you'll probably just end up like the others.  You'd best return to whoever sent you.  They might be worried.13397You're a real star, .  See, when I give one of these other soldiers an assignment, the odds of them getting it done are about fifty-fifty.  The odds of them coming back... well, slightly worse.But with you, it's always a guaranteed thing.  Like gnomish clockwork!Anyway, I have another one for you.  Sindragosa's Fall, east of the valley.  There is some serious cultist activity, including and not limited to, the raising of frost wyrms.  I need you to go kick their teeth in.I hate cultists.13398A whole brood of blue dragons fell here.  And now, one by one, they're being raised by his servants.He raised the biggest of them all himself.  Bring me some bone dust from the whelps and I'll show you exactly how he did it.13399You have a lot of questions, .  You're the only one who can see me because you touched something that once belonged to him... don't you remember?You don't know what it is?  Well I can't just tell you... that would make him really mad.  He's not just a prince anymore... he's the king!Meet me at the Court of Bones, north of Icecrown Citadel and you can see for yourself.13400Before the prince became a king, he fought many battles... but only one where he came close to dying.It was fought right here.  After you let me show you what happened, you'll understand everything.Find a bloodstained stone and pick it up from the floor.  You'll see what happened.13401Now you know what you're up against, .  An opponent who no longer knows pain... remorse... or humanity.  An opponent who will do anything to get what he wants.The heart was his weakness and now he knows you've found it.If you're going to go back for it, you'd best bring help.  He will not leave it unguarded again.13402It's not the first time I've heard that story about Arthas and his heart... always thought it was some made-up tale to impress the rank and file.We must act on this information immediately.  Unfortunately, we must do so in secret.Arthas's agents are everywhere and if he finds out, our plan is dead in the water.We need to take this to the Argent Crusade.  Every single paladin in that order was hand-picked by Tirion himself.  If there's anyone free of cultist infiltration, it's those guys.13403Just this morning, my scouts informed me of a Cult of the Damned procession leaving from Icecrown Citadel to the Cathedral of Darkness, bearing an artifact.And now I learn that it might be Arthas's own heart... a thing containing the last bit of his remaining humanity.This is a sign of the Light.  As long as such an artifact exists, there is a chance that Arthas Menethil can become a man again!Meet me at the cathedral's entrance.  Be sure to bring a cultist's hood -- we're going incognito.13408The Hellfire Citadel wages constant battles with our forces.  We are holding our own so far, but we can't yet launch a real offensive against them.  To do that, we need forward staging areas.Our scouts identified three fortifications near Hellfire Citadel.

A courier relayed a message from a tauren named Xarantaur, who said he was visiting a taunka village called Camp Tunka'lo. The note was somewhat cryptic, but it seems this Xarantaur has come to Storm Peaks to learn the history of a taunka legend.Meet up with him, . See if what he knows can help us in any way.

Return to me with the basket when you've found ten Noblegarden Chocolates.13504There are a large number of Shatterspear trolls picking through the ruins to the north and northeast. I suspect that they're looking for magical artifacts, but none of our scouts have reported the discovery of anything of significance turning up from their digs. They may well just be fueling their war.One thing is fairly certain though: less laborers would slow down their offensive, so less laborers is what they're going to get. You in?13505There are several ruins similar to these spread through Darkshore, many of them inhabited by the troubled spirits of the Highborne. Out of mild courtesy for their cursed souls, we haven't been overly proactive about stripping the ruins of artifacts, but those hesitancies vanish in light of this new troll threat.While you're aiding the Sentinels in their goals within the ruins, please collect any artifacts that you stumble upon and bring them back to me. I would like to preserve what little I can.13506These appear to be orders dispatched to the overseers at the ruins from a superior in the Shatterspear War Camp. Most of the document contains negligible strategic value, but a couple lines stick out to you.\"We captured another night elf spying on our operation. She has been taken back to the camp to be tortured for more information. Keep an eye out for additional spies - we cannot afford for our operation to be compromised.\"The Lieutenant will surely want this information.13507To the north, the Shatterspear have a war camp where they are constructing their catapults. The camp is guarded by some of their mystics, but I've started receiving reports that there are sightings of orcs and tauren there as well.I don't want to make any assumptions as to what that suggests, but I do want you to go in and kill them before they can make any further strikes on our Sentinels.13508I have a scout that we lost contact with a couple days ago. I assumed her dead, but it appears that she's been captured. The trolls indicate that they have at least two captives though... the only other person that comes to mind is Alanndarian Nightsong, a civilian that was in the area against my advisement early yesterday.The Shatterspear have established a war camp to the north - it is almost certainly where any of their prisoners are being taken. Find them and free them if you're able.13509The trolls are building their forces and supplies at the war camp to the north. When they feel they are ready, they will almost certainly launch their attack on Lor'danel from that location. It shouldn't take us long to rout this rabble, but I'm not one for taking unnecessary risks.I want you to fight your way into the war camp and set fire to any stockpiles of supplies that you see. The setback should buy us quite a bit of time before they can muster a counterattack.13510It's good to see you. I wasn't looking forward to enduring what Alanndarian did, so the rescue is somewhat welcome.I saw the troll leader before I was captured, and thought I had the perfect opportunity to kill him, but he's protected by some sort of magic shield. Morra needs to know before she mounts her assault, but first, we need to get out of here.Help me to the dock - I'll make my way to Lor'danel via water, and you can go back to Morra with the intel.13511Morra sent you? I should have listened to her - it's just hard to take trolls seriously I guess.It's way too late for that anyway. We're mortal now... this is the fate we have to face, one way or another. I've had time to accept that.I have one request though... kill the torturer that did this to me. They call him Rit'ko... you can find him just ahead with the other prisoner.13512Striking at the head of the beast doesn't work if there's another head to replace it. Before we can kill their leader, we need to kill the subleaders that may try to step up. Right now, they are not as well defended, and you should be able to best them without much support.Take this dryad spear and hunt them down. The poison on its tip should slow their incantations. My scouts reported one inside the water chamber in the ruins to the east and the other past the remains of the tower to the southwest.13513I've already been working on something for breaking down their protective wards. With a focus based in their power and a bit of druidic magic, we should be able to breach their shields.Find their shaman to the east and southeast and recover several of their amulets. I will prepare them and imbue an arrow that you can deliver to Sandrya Moonfall for the attack.13514Come to join the offensive? If you're looking for Sandrya Moonfall, she's leading the attack on the Shatterspear leader at the cave in the back of the vale, you can meet her there.While you're here though, we could certainly use your help with routing the rest of their tribe. Go ahead and take the company of one of the Vengeful Protectors there and see to it that every last building is destroyed and every last troll killed. We can't have them coming back for revenge when we're less prepared, can we?13515Their leader and his guard are before us. My Sentinels are ready to take care of his guard, we only awaited this arrow to seal their leader's fate.Let me know when you are prepared to attack. As soon as my Sentinels engage, I will shatter the leader's shield, and we will assault him together. Strike swiftly and we can rout this threat to our lands here and now.We await only you - speak to me when ready.13518It's too late for Laird, he didn't make it in time.The last wave of night elves from Auberdine attempted to escape a couple of hours ago. They stayed in their old home, clinging to the hope that it could be salvaged, but it seems they were finally forced out. I fear many of them won't make it, like Laird did not.Quickly, go down the coast to the west and find any survivors that you can. We're sending Sentinels and Hippogryphs down, but every moment counts - we need to know which ones might make it.13519A group of Twilight's Hammer cultists has set up camp southwest of here.  They're preparing an army of water elementals to use against Lor'danel.Their leader, High Cultist Azerynn, has pacts with the dark Old Gods that grant his sect power over the elements.  Go and deal with them before it's too late, .The cataclysm has left the elemental spirits in disarray... it's only a matter of time until they have enough elementals to overcome our defenses.13520It is good to see you. You were key in ensuring that our loved ones made it home, and I hold some hope that you may yet help us further.Like Laird, their wounds will be grave - every one of them battered by the coast and assaulted by the elementals. I am doing what I can, but it seems that those elementals hosted a toxin that is weakening their ability to heal. I believe I can concoct a salve, but I will need secretion from the muscles of the clams that inhabit this coast. Can you help me?13521Greetings!I'm helping Tharnariun here try to unravel what's been corrupting the wildlife in the area. I've set up some machines in the field that can analyze animal parts and possible corruption agents. If you can get me some good samples, we can get to the bottom of this affliction quickly.The first machine is Buzzbox 413. I set it up on the beach just east of town. I'll need you to gather some flesh from the nearby corrupted tide crawlers and bring it to the machine so that I can analyze it.13522Some of the survivors of this last Auberdine attack are still trying to make it up the coast to safety. We only caught word that they were coming within the last hour. I wish that we had more warning...The coastline west of us is swarming with vile spray, vicious little water elementals. We need to clear them out if any of the survivors are to have a chance of making it to Lor'danel. Depart immediately and kill every elemental you see.13523Do not worry about me.  My wounds are deep and death will soon come to me.It is all up to you now... you must stop the Twilight's Hammer.The Old Gods they worship have granted them power over the restless water spirits... but that power is tenuous.  Channel Elune's presence through this orb once the elementals have been defeated.Use the power of Elune to banish the spirits permanently.13525Our ancestors lived alongside the Blackwood furbolgs for generations. But recently, we have lost contact with their settlements deeper in the forest. One of their larger villages, Blackwood Hold, can be found to the south.Travel there and find Elder Brolg. Ask him why his people have withdrawn from us and offer your help, if necessary.13526The foul satyr of Felwood have started to introduce their poison into Darkshore, into our lands. Their corruption kills the land and twists the creatures who live in it. My people are no exception.Our magic alone is not enough to bring them back to their senses. There is an herb, called bear's paw, that we use to break fevers and fortify the weak. With its help, we may be able to break the influence of the satyr. The herb grows in the wilds around the village.13527Interesting! The source of this corruption definitely came from something external--no surprises there--but it appears that in this case they've been eating something foul. A large mammal probably. Most likely a bear.Search the beach for a bear carcass for me. Slightly east of there would make the most sense, on the inland side of the beach. Bring me the sample back at town.13528There are a couple other forms of wildlife that we've verified infected. It's actually good news that the crabs appear to have caught this from the bears - hopefully that means this all stems from one source. We need to focus our attention on those bears now.Buzzbox 723 is near the waterfalls to the east. It's going to be messy work, but it's necessary - I'll need you to bring some fresh bear guts to that buzzbox for analysis. We'll go from there once I have the information.13529I rushed here as soon as I heard the news from Wizbang. I know who's behind this mess now. Zenn Foulhoof.He came over from Teldrassil after he was chased out for performing perverse magics. The kinds of corruption he employs are not welcome among my people, and it seems he's taken it a step further this time, perhaps as some form of revenge.Zenn's been given too many chances, it's time we remove this threat to all that is natural. Kill Zenn and his minions, and then find me back in Lor'danel.13537Between boat rides and building, I'm exhausted... and hungry. You know what sounds tasty? Fish. Fish sound delicious.Darkshore is known for its grouper. If you fish me up some, I'll make it worth your time.13538The three towers south of the Wintergrasp river are draining power from the Fortress! Destroy Shadowsight Tower, Flamewatch Tower or Winter's Edge Tower, then return to me. Remember, only siege vehicles can damage a tower, so make sure to protect them from the Horde!13539While the Alliance may be pounding on our doors, a true tactician looks beyond the obvious.\"Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.\", I need you to travel across the Wintergrasp River and destroy one of the three towers to the south. Our Warlocks report that the towers are draining power we could use to bolster our own troops.Return to me once you've destroyed a tower.13542If we're going to take the Ruins of Auberdine back from the Twilight's Hammer, the elementals that they've summoned must be dealt with on a permanent basis.That's where you come in.Look, I don't expect you to retake the town, but while we're healing up here, you can soften them up for us.To permanently deal with the frenzied cyclones, head west, kill them, take their bracers, and put them in the moonwell. That will destroy the bracers and keep those elementals from being resummoned.13543I've flown through the ruins of Auberdine on a scouting mission. There are three Twilight's Hammer cultists that are responsible for the elementals that have overrun the destroyed town.Head west into the ruins. Seek out and slay Cloudtamer Wildmane, Windmaster Tzu-Tzu, and Skylord Braax.Only then will Sentinel Selarin and her forces stand a chance of taking back their home.13544Before the bear's paw can be used to cleanse the afflicted, it must be completed and blessed. To the north of the village roams a tallstrider named Fleetfoot. You'll need its tailfeathers to complete the herb bundle.Bring the tailfeathers and the bear's paw bundle to the ancient bear statue in the ruins around the Grove of the Ancient, further north of where you'll find Fleetfoot.While at the shrine, combine the tailfeathers with the bear's paw and receive the bear spirit's blessing.13545With the sacred herbs and the bear's blessing, you must use this herb bundle to cleanse my brothers. The corruption spilling over from Felwood has driven them mad and they will attack any who come near. Expect the afflicted Blackwood to be angry with you until you have slain the spirits of corruption that haunt them.When you have freed my brothers from their madness, return to me.13546The Jadefire satyrs of Felwood have found their way into Darkshore, tainting the land, water, and creatures they encounter. You've seen what their corruption has done to my people and their homes. If we do not turn back the satyrs, all of us will share that fate.Within the cave to the east is Sharax the Defiler, the satyr responsible for the ills of the Blackwood. Slay him, , and free us from his influence. Show the satyr that the Blackwood will not lay down and die so easily.13547Your friends back at the refugee camp are unaware of the true and imminent danger that the Twilight's Hammer cultists have already brought into the world.For you to deal with that, we'll first need to get some help from the dead of Auberdine.Search through the ruins of the town and find the corpses of Thundris Windweaver, Elissa Starbreeze, Taldan, and Caylais Moonfeather. Coax the spirits from their bodies and then return with them to me here.1354813549Along with the Drakkari artifacts, I'm interested in returning to Zandalar with some of the Zul'Drak wildlife. I have males of both the frost leopards and icepaw bears, but I need females!Too bad that my trapper was killed in a most unfortunate accident. Perhaps you would be willing to fill in for him?Put the leopards and bears to sleep with this blowgun then lift their tails and return with some females if you would be so kind. They can be found near the Altars of Rhunok, Quetz'lun, and Har'koa.13554Duskrats! They've been eating the duskrats! Those little buggers only come from one place, a cave against the cliff-face to the east. Find a path up to the northeast and look for an opening under the waterfall.The duskrats there are either getting into something nasty or someone's intentionally spreading some agent through them - in either case, just bring me back several samples of the stuff!13556How ya doin', mon?

Sometimes the raptors carry 'em to keep 'em warm, too.13557This key appears to be for the animal cages spread throughout Cliffspring Hollow. Tharnariun would surely appreciate if you took advantage of the situation to free some of the uncorrupted duskrats and thistle bears that are still being held captive.13558Aetherion is almost in our world, but he can still be dealt with!At the end of the dock floats a ritual orb. I want you to use it to complete the ritual, beckoning the elemental lord down from his vortex.Trust me, , I and the other spirits that you have freed will greatly weaken Aetherion. However, it will be up to you to finish him off for good and save the Kaldorei people of Darkshore from utter destruction.Deliver his essence to Corvine Moonrise at the refugee camp so he will know.1355913560You look like an able sort!There are a great number of wrecks off of the coast here... most old, some new. For quite some time, I've been trying to get at their holds and put their valuables to more use, but there's a nasty infestation of murlocs that seem to have other ideas. I've sent scores of adventurers and none have returned.Worry not, I've learned my lesson, and that is not your fate. Swim to the due north and look for Gary. He'll explain the new plan. It's pretty simple really.13561I have come to Bashal'Aran to grant peace to the troubled spirits of the Highborne, but I find my hand hesitates with each blow. If you would like to aid me, you would have my gratitude.13562It is in times like these that we are forced to stop and examine our way of life. We are mortal now, and no matter how much we desire otherwise, we are deserving of our new place in this world.Bashal'Aran, down the road to the south, once a city of our ancestors, it now is home to their cursed ghosts. We held hope of salvation for them as with ourselves, but we have left them in torment for too long. It is time to extinguish the Final Flame of Bashal'Aran.13563I would like to extend my gratitude for saving us. I would call myself fortunate, but my beloved, Anaya, lays long dead. I am alone and deeply troubled, and sadly, I require your aid yet again.Wandering the woods of Darkshore after my rescue, I found myself in the ruins of Bashal'Aran... where I saw the haunted spirit of my beloved.She must be freed, but I lack the heart to do it. Her spirit must be destroyed.13564Please help... I can barely sit up.My friend, a bear named Grimclaw, he's not here. I sent him ahead to let the Sentinels know we were coming before we left Auberdine, but he never arrived. I sensed something might be amiss as we were leaving, but with the evacuation, I never had a chance to act on it.If he's injured, there's only one place that he would go - the Withering Thicket, north of Auberdine, down the road to the south from here. Bring him back to me safely... he's my only family.13565We cannot condone reckless violence - it is not our nature. However, there are times when the consequences of avoiding battle are too tangible to ignore, as is the case with these naga.When the earth in the area shattered, a small section of ruins rose to our east. These ruins once housed those loyal to Queen Azshara, and it seems her kind have returned in search of something.Take this petrified root. You can use it on their fallen to raise ents to aid you. Deal with them and their leader swiftly.13566While we tend to Grimclaw, I would like you to peacefully gather some ritual materials for me from the nearby wildlife.I need whiskers from the moonstalkers to the west- pluck them from the sleeping ones and move away quickly.I need hair from the doe to the east, just avoid the stags.Finally, I need fur from the bears along the water to the northeast. Wait until they catch a fish, then get the sample quickly and get away before they finish eating.Please do not harm any of them.13567In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker.

They have sent Sharax the Defiler to subdue parts of the forest that we Blackwood call home.In addition to poisoning the land, animals, and plants, he has set up Jadefire braziers throughout the village to help extend his control over our people. Destroying the braziers alone won't be enough to stop him, but it will help lessen his influence while you work with Elder Brolg to free our brothers.13573It was only recently that we heard the news of Malfurion's awakening, mere moments before the Cataclysm occurred.As soon as he regained consciousness, he gave a cryptic warning about the land splitting in two if something wasn't done and how all the shockwaves were converging here on Darkshore.He then reportedly set off for somewhere in this vicinity.  I was sent here to find him, but I've found my hands full helping the refugees.Perhaps you could look for him to the southeast for us.13575If we're to stabilize the forces of nature, we'll need every little bit of help we can get.  The furbolg of the Blackwood tribe have long inhabited the area and have strong ties to the land.Their elder Shaman, Elder Brownpaw, wields great power over the elements -- his assistance would be invaluable.  See if you can obtain their aid.13576With most of our brethren losing their way to madness or corruption, it would seem that we have little choice but to ally with you, .  You can count on our aid... once you've proven we can count on yours.As you can see, my people are having a bit of a problem with the fire elementals.  Help fight them and use this totem on their fiery remains.We will return them to where they belong... whether they like it or not.13577The wildkin were once numerous in Darkshore.  Such are their ties to the land that the Cataclysm that shattered Darkshore also decimated their numbers.The wildkin Aroom is the last of his tribe and is a powerful elder with a strong connection to Elune.  His help will be most necessary in healing the land -- you will find him north of here at the Moontouched Den.13578Aroom is last of tribe...Others won't rest... need funeral pyre.  Bring Aroom the feathers of others.... let them rest.Then Aroom help you.13579Nothing will repair the land quicker than the strength of those who inhabit it.  We night elves are fortunate that some of our best allies just happen to be both the land and its inhabitants at once.The Ancient of War known as Selenn was charged with guarding the ruins of Ameth'Aran, to the south.  Go there and seek his help.13580Their fiery spirits are contained in the totem now.  Take it to the top of the Jagged Reef near the Blazing Strand and set it on the ground.The totem's soothing energies will slowly wash over the elementals until their fury simmers down to calm.You must protect the totem, for fire does not react favorably to the ritual of soothing.13581It won't be immediate, but the elementals' anger will soon die down and my people will live to fight another day.I will go help you and Malfurion in any way that I can.13582We need special flame for ritual.

Aroom in your debt now.Aroom help you now.  Return to Malfurion, I join you soon.13584I would be neglecting my responsibility if I abandoned my post just now, with so many elementals out of control in the ruins.Let us deal with them first, before we see how we can aid Malfurion.  What do you say, small one?13585My duty here has been fulfilled as best it can.  Send word to Malfurion that I'll be joining him soon.Good luck to you, .  Good luck to all of us.13586Our efforts in containing the destruction don't appear to be quite enough.  I fear we're going to need aid from beyond the waking world.Twilight cultists inside the Earthshatter Cavern to the east have opened a gateway to a nightmare-infested section of the Emerald Dream.  They hold a green dragon prisoner named Thessera there.Go through the nightmare portal and free her.  She will be a powerful ally.13587Malfurion's words are true, small one.  The rift that threatens to split Darkshore in half also threatens the separation between this world and yours.Let me aid you in any way that I can, lest further rifts between our worlds amplify the destruction taking place in both places.First you must undo the shackles cast upon me by retrieving the emerald scroll from the nightmare guardian that roams the halls below.13588Twilight riders circle the skies above the vortex.  I fear it is their magic that has kept the cataclysmic forces from being contained by our efforts.Take to the skies with Thessera and destroy the riders and the portal from whence they came.13589If we didn't have enough on our hands with the land and the elements turning against us, it seems something has riled up the trolls to the northeast, and they've started on a war path. I'm not sure what their aims are, but they've already attacked several of our scouts and have besieged the cultists at the Tower of Althalaxx.We've sent a contingent of our best Sentinels to counter their attacks. If you would travel northeast to the ruins and join them, I'm certain that they could use the extra hand.13590Their forces are weakened, their supplies destroyed, and their subleaders are dead. It is time for us to take this fight to their home, and their leader. I'm admittedly still in the dark as to what spurred their sudden aggression, but perhaps we will find some answers on their doorstep.Take this arrow that Balthule prepared and report to Sandrya Moonfall deep in Shatterspear Vale to join the attack. It would be best to secure a ride on one of our nightsabers - going on foot would be dangerous.13591The letter from Garrosh Hellscream makes clear the suspicions that were raised during the offensive on the Shatterspear. The presence of forsaken at the tower ruins and horde supplies and enforcers at the Shatterspear War Camp were only the start. Garrosh himself contacted the Shatterspear to spur their offensive towards Lor'danel, and it seems clear that he fully intends to push from the south as well.Glynda Nal'Shea will need this information if the night elves are to be prepared.13592The tournament is a time for testing your skills against your peers, but we must not forget that the real enemy, the Scourge, will not wait. As you hone your skills against others, so should you maintain your edge in combat against the enemy.Travel to the area southwest of the Valley of Fallen Heroes and north of Corp'rethar. There, the Scourge raises dead heroes and turns them against us. Defeat these minions of the Scourge, do honor to our allies, and keep yourself prepared for combat.13593Welcome, champion. Word of your combat prowess has already reached my ears.

The Horde scum across the road to the east at Bathran's Haunt need to be taught a lesson.Their new warlord, Garrosh Hellscream, has them up to no good. Feel like teaching them a thing or two?I'd come with you, but my assignment is to stay here and protect Orendil's apprentices, and that's exactly what I'm going to do.13595These creatures... these so-called Horde... they have cut me down in my prime and they are harvesting my hair for their evil plans.Will you help me to put an end to it, little ?I have overheard their herbalists speaking of something called wildfire upon their table across the way. If you were to take the bottle of this unnatural stuff and throw it at my corpse to the northeast, it would burn and no more of my hair will grow here.I am already dead and it is a small price to pay to stop them.13596We're not fully aware of the intentions of the Twilight's Hammer cultists to the southwest.  We fear an attack on Lor'danel, however their motives might go well beyond that.I need you to go to the Twilight Encampment and get your hands on their plans.  Hurry, .  We might not have much time.13597In these woods reside three great spirits, that of the Stag, that of the Thistle Bear, and that of the Moonstalker. These spirits make powerful allies, but you can only align yourself with one of them.If you wish to align yourself with the Great Thistle Bear Spirit, take this incense to a cave just east of the great whirlpool. Meditate before the great spirit while burning the incense on the ground between you, and face his trial to earn his blessing. Should you succeed, return to me.13598I have no doubts that Grimclaw will recover with the help of my healing magics, though I can't say the same for the poachers that attacked him. Still, I could use some salve to close his wounds and lessen his pain while he heals.To the east you will find the Ruins of Lornesta. Among the crumbled stones, there is a variety of fuming toadstool that flourishes in the damp environment. Bring me some of the toadstools so that I can mix a salve for our friend here.13599With the binding complete, the blessing has taken hold. It will most certainly make your travels in these lands easier.Grimclaw made a full recovery. Before I could do anything to stop him, he bolted off towards Lor'danel. I suppose that means it's time for your departure.It was a great pleasure to have met you. For now, farewell - send my best wishes to Volcor and Grimclaw.13600Of all the times to have such rotten luck!My tournament blade has gone missing. I've heard the bards telling tales of travelers offering winter hyacinths to a lonely maiden in return for gifts. Those hyacinths grow only on the ice flowing from the Ironwall Dam, on Crystalsong Forest's northwestern border with Icecrown. Gather the flowers and take them to the circle of lamps in Drak'Mar Lake in northeastern Dragonblight, near Zul'Drak and Grizzly Hills. Ask the lonely maiden for a worthy blade.13601By Elune!  It appears that many of those we feared dead from the attack on old Auberdine have taken refuge in a camp outside the town ruins.The cultists at the Twilight Encampment were planning on making quick work of them.  It's a good thing that you successfully attacked their position.Seek out Priestess Alinya at the Refugee Camp east of old Auberdine and far south of here.13602There is evil lurking on the coast to the west.The Zoram Strand is the resting place of the doomed city of Zoram, destroyed during the Sundering and submerged beneath the seas. It has been lost to the night elves for ages. Lost, and nearly forgotten.Now, the naga have returned, and for what reason we do not know. But reason matters little; we must slay these fiends and throw them back to the depths!13603Good, honest, honed steel may not carry the day. The other combatants are using enchanted blades and I find myself at a disadvantage, but all is not lost.There's an old legend from Grizzly Hills about a maiden cursed with a frog's form to protect the blade she has long guarded. She lives among the lake frogs on the shore of Ashwood Lake, just east of Ashwood Post. The only thing said to break the curse is a kiss, freely given. Apply this balm before kissing anything, . Otherwise, you'll catch warts.13604This platinum disc is surprisingly symmetrical and devoid of any scratches or imperfections.

Together we should be able to make it to the refugee camp.13606Freya's Sigil is going to be one of the tougher ones, I reckon.According to the Archivum, the essence of the Sigil is tied to her three elder servants, Brightleaf, Ironbranch and Stonebark.  Should any of the elders be harmed, the Sigil's integrity will be compromised.Sparing the elders, however, means that Freya will be more powerful when you face her.What can I say, .  We're stuck between a rock and hard place.13607Listen, !  Azeroth's fate is at stake here.Our only chance is to get to the Celestial Planetarium in time to find this Algalon and stop him from beaming back any messages to his Titan masters.Locate the Celestial Planetarium and come back with any information you get.

Familiarize yourself with the tactics available to you and use them to defeat the three different kinds of training dummies.13626There were two humans here: Feero Ironhand and Delgren the Purifier.

Don't want any unnecessary suspicion now, do we?This coliseum requires more lumber than we've stockpiled and there's no way I'm going to pay to have it shipped in from Grizzly Hills. At the western end of Crystalsong Forest, by the Great Tree, grow a number of young Crystalsong oaks. They'd provide just the kind of planking we need for building and scaffolding.

I believe they did so because they were attracted to what the dead cultists there uncovered:  three moonstones.Liladris Moonriver will counsel you to deal with the furbolg in a more direct manner, and I will not gainsay her, but I would ask that you go to the ruins and deactivate the moonstones.13631We'd best hurry now, .  We're going to have to transmit the reply-code from Dalaran.Take it to Rhonin, I will meet you there.13632The moon priestess has a plan to make sure that no further furbolg descend upon us from the highlands.

When you have steeled yourself we will speak again and I will summon forth a whirling vortex to speed your way up to the skies over Thunder Peak.Channel the power of the Earthen Ring through the elemental to slay Lord Magmathar so that we may bring him into balance once more.13889The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.The drawings are rough, but you can make out the shapes of diemetradons, stegodons, and pterrordaxes. As the raptor finishes the sketch, it looks up at you, bares its teeth, and makes a biting motion.Your venomhide hatchling must be craving fresh meat from these animals. Find and kill any type of diematradon, stegodon, or pterrordax in Un'Goro Crater and feed its meat to your hungry hatchling.13890This is no small task, !We have more ships arriving, and without the lighthouse they'll be lost - or worse! You are hereby charged with keeping its fire lit.Collect the blubber from the hydras in these waters, then bring it to the forge here to melt it into oil.Throwing that oil on the lighthouse fire will buy us the time we need.13891Now that the creatures of Darkshore are safe, let's turn our attention to the artifact you found in the lake. I believe it's the work of a minion of the Old Gods. We'll fight these fiends using the very lifegiving energies of Darkshore itself! Take the Lifebringer Sapling to the shore of the shallow lake to the south of here. Wave it over the waters of the lake and it should disable that ancient artifact.Be careful, . The artifact is likely to be guarded by who-knows-what.13892To the southwest lies the corpse of a being somehow related to the Old Gods that the Twilight's Hammer cultists worship.He was defeated before our time -- if not by the Titans themselves, certainly by one of their creations.We've noted an increase in cult activity in that area which can only mean something terrible is amiss.We're going to need to find out what they're planning to do there and why.  Take this figurine, it'll help you avoid being detected while you gather intelligence.13893The Master's Glaive was the site of an ancient battle, .  The titans sent twenty of their stone giants against Soggoth.Of those twenty giants, one survived.The tablets say that Kronn, the largest of the stone giants allowed himself to be entangled by Soggoth's tendrils -- just long enough to be lifted close enough to the creature's skull... within reach of his mighty sword.It's a good thing he's dead... we don't really have twenty stone giants lying around to stop him again.13895We may not have twenty stone giants to take on our enemy, but we giants of ancient lumber are as strong as any rock.Look around you, .  My kindred sleep... yet they will heed the keeper's horn when the time of need is upon them.You will find Aros, the keeper of the grove, beyond the bridge northeast of here.Tell him the urgency of our situation.13896Listen, .  We need to learn more about what we're up against.To the southwest, beyond the Master's Glaive, there is a group of dwarven prospectors who were excavating the nearby ruins.Perhaps they have uncovered knowledge that is useful to us in this matter.13897The ancients of the grove have come to our aid, .  I can see through their eyes even as we speak.The Twilight's Hammer has been forced to hasten their ritual and have thus only managed to resurrect but a remnant of dread Soggoth.Destroy it before it's too late, .  I am needed elsewhere.Return to the druids at the Grove of the Ancients when it is all over they will direct you further.13898We cannot let the naga get away with this, .  Slaying the keeper of the grove amounts to a declaration of war.You'll find their den inside a cave on the island of Naj'vel, far to the southwest.I want you to send them a clear message.13899If the naga want to throw in their lot with the Twilight's Hammer, then may Elune have mercy on them.Go into their lair in the island of Nazj'vel and find their leader, the naga warlord known only as Wrathspine.Perhaps the horn of the ancients can still be saved.13900The warlord said the horn of the ancients was being offered to Azshara above Nazj'vel.Perhaps it's not too late to save the ancient relic from being destroyed.13901There is more to this naga problem than meets the eye, .  It appears that the issue will not be resolved by merely thinning their numbers. To humble them, a more severe impression must be made.Travel to the northern end of Zoram Strand and enter Blackfathom Deep. Once there, demonstrate to the naga that their presence in this region will no longer be tolerated!13902Our work in Darkshore is not yet done.  We might have stopped the landmass from shattering, but our enemies still have a strong presence in the area.I want you to contact a group of druids at the Grove of the Ancients, far to the south.  They are led by an old friend of mine, Balren of the Claw.Tell them that the time has come to take the battle to our foes.  I will come to aid them as soon as we stabilize the area.13903The venomhide hatchling looks at you expectantly, then begins to scrawl a pictogram into the dirt.The hatchling's drawings seem to resemble various types of large insects, perhaps the gorishi silithids. The hatchling finishes his picture, then gestures at it with one short arm, snaps its jaws, and licks its lips.It must want you to go to the Slithering Scar, in the center of the southern part of Un'Goro Crater, and gather silithid meat. When you have the meat, feed it to your hungry hatchling.13904The venomhide hatchling's stomach growls as it gestures to get your attention. It begins scratching pictures of silithids into the dirt, adding small ovals underneath them. It looks at you hopefully and gestures at the circles.They can only mean silithid eggs. The Noxious Lair, in western Tanaris and near the border with Un'Goro Crater, would probably be a great place to find the eggs your little hatchling wants.13905The hatchling looks at you for a moment, almost as if wondering whether you'll understand. It scrawls a picture of a pair of feathers in the dirt, then points with one claw to the bindings at its elbows and knees.It doesn't seem hungry, but what could the feathers be for?It must want them for adornments like the ones you've seen on other raptors. The largest feathers come from the searing rocs that congregate around the bones of large creatures in western Tanaris, northeast of Thistleshrub Valley.13906With your expert feeding and care, your venomhide hatchling will grow quickly. As they grow, their hatchling teeth will be replaced by adult teeth. If you keep the teeth shed by your hatchling as it grows, you'll have an easy way to tell when it's mature enough to be trained as a mount.Your venomhide will let you know what it needs, so pay close attention. When it has shed all of its baby teeth, return to me with your venomhide and the materials for your saddle and I'll do the rest.13907The big beards at Ironforge sent me here to check on Remtravel's dig the moment they got word of the disaster. Look at it! Precious artifacts washed to sea, months of tedious digging undone in a moment.When the tidal waves hit, they demolished the murloc encampments along the shore. Good news? Naw, not with my luck. The survivors are squatting in the shelter of the ruins, and they're doing more damage than the elements ever could. Would you mind getting your waders on and taking care of things?13909We can figure this out, . We just need some Dwarven ingenuity. Think, Groffy, think!These murlocs are just looking for a home, right? Let's do something constructive. I mean that literally.All sorts of debris was washed ashore during the catastrophe, and some of the decimated murloc hovels may still be salvageable. Run along the shore here and gather up any building materials fit for a murloc. That's an admittedly low standard.13910Can we build it? Yes we can! Just west of the dig site I planted a banner on the shore. The sand is firm and it's as good a site as any. Take my tools and the parts you collected and build these ornery pests a different place to live.13911Who are you again? ? Have we met? If you're here from the League, you can tell them I'm not leaving! Not without my find. I had it, right in my hands! Then the screaming. Then the wetness.Listen here whos-yer-name, I documented the whole thing in my journal the day the tidal wave hit. And I know just where I left it! The journal. Not the find. Help me get the one so we can get the other! Or vice-versa! Do you follow? Follow me!13912Underneath Remtravel's forgetful exterior is the mind of a genius, an enigma cloaked in senility. But I'm not about to give up on the old man. Look at what I found in his notes... not there... no, that's a shopping list... Here, on the page where he's trying to figure out what year it is: The Disc!We think this Titan artifact is some sort of encrypted storage wheel. We were carefully unearthing it when the disaster hit, but hopefully it's still in the ruins. Dive in and grab it for me!13913The gnome explosives squad we requested from Tinker Town arrived last week. Just in time to face an assault by the Horde. We lost a lot of soldiers that day. Most of the gnome team was taken as well. Now we're neck deep in Horde, Silverwind Refuge has been lost and we're down a dozen gnomes.I'm begging for your help here, . Travel east to Silverwind Refuge and look for any gnome survivors. They were all carted off by a big, merciless orc named Thundrak. Find him and you'll find our gnomes.13918Now that we have the disc, a lot of our earlier finds are starting to make sense. Shortly after my arrival, Prospector Remtravel unearthed what he presumed to be a prehistoric toaster.It's my belief that this slotted box is some sort of data reader. Unfortunately, it broke apart and washed away with the rest of our base camp when the tidal wave struck!It can't have gone far, . Pieces must be buried in the nearby sand. Here, use my trusty buried artifact detector to comb the beach for them.13919It didn't work.The eruption of Thunder Peak must have affected it in some way. You must take the tear to the Moonwell of Purity, which still lies intact, protected by the goddess' power, at the southeast base of the volcano.There, you will wash it in the sacred waters of Elune. What happens beyond that, I cannot say. I fear for my daughter's life. It is in your hands now, .13920We have urgent need for good s at Hellscream's Watch, . But before you're dispatched, there remains something that needs doing here.Most of our perishable goods were lost at sea due mainly to Alliance attacks. We must stock enough food to carry out our Ashenvale campaign.Just east of here, you should find wildlife in abundance. Bring back the best meat you can find for our troops!13921You seek to cure a child, but know that all things come at a cost. To the east lies Raynewood Tower. Standing outside the tower, next to my moonwell, is one who has fallen into corruption.Avrus Illwhisper seeks forgiveness and redemption, . Will you help him to attain that which he desires and in so doing achieve your own goal?13922My former clan, the Felmusk of Night Run, raided Fallen Sky Lake some time ago, stealing the moonstones that were unique to the area.Those moonstones are known to have great healing properties and surely can be used to cure the little girl that lies sick in Astranaar.Night Run rests up the road to the east that runs north. There are multiple paths that lead up into the hills on its eastern side, and it is there that you will find my unrepentant brethren. They will have what you seek.13923Into the fray with you, !Hellscream's Watch is one of our most contentious fronts in Ashenvale. The experience should serve you well... assuming you survive.When you've made ready, speak with Andruk. I've arranged for him to transport you directly to your station.Once you've arrived, seek out Captain Goggath. He will guide you further.Bring pain and death to our enemies! For the Horde!13924Thank you for saving me from a fate worse than death, ! For saving both the child and myself!Well, the child is almost saved. All you have to do is take the moonstones back west down the road to Astranaar. Hand them to Pelturas and he will know what to do.Go in peace, my friend. Elune be praised!13925Are you familiar with the Old Ones, ? Onu and I agree that the artifact you found in the lake can only be their work, and it's devouring Darkshore. Something is stirring up terrors we thought dead long ago. This is bigger than you or me, but my first concern is protecting the wildlife.Here, this sapling contains the life essence you gathered for me. I believe it can protect the local fauna. Test it out on a nearby un-consumed bear, stag, or moonstalker, and let me know what happens!13926The orphans have been looking forward to the opportunity to meet friends like you, . It's wonderful that you've agreed to take one into your care.Take this whistle.  With it, you will be able to call for the orphan you have agreed to sponsor.

So far we've been able to repel the Horde, but now they're going around us to directly attack the retreat to the north.The keeper sent out his dryads to defend the tree, but they do not seem to be much of a match for the vanguard of the Warsong orcs.I need you to go out there and recover as many laughing sister corpses as you can. Take them to Halannia inside the tree at the retreat. She will know what to do.13929Before there was a big war and we left the village, we remember Soo-say telling us all about the biggest tree ever!Soo-say call it Grizzlemaw or something. Soo-say tell us it in the middle Grizzle Hills. No, wait, that not what Soo-say say. Soo-say say Grizzly Hills. Now we remember! Tree is big and right in middle of Grizzly Hills. Can't miss!You take us there, oki? We see inside of giant tree? Soo-say tell us big bear men live in tree too. Maybe we see them.13930High Shaman Rakjak always tell stories of mighty warriors, even ones far away.

High Shaman Rakjak tell Kekek that giant tree-city Grizzlemaw stand in the middle of Grizzly Hills.Kekek never see a city before meeting orphan lady, but this city have no warriors, only men in purple dresses. Kekek want to see real warriors fight for real city.13933Sometimes High-Oracle Soo-say tell stories about a shrine to dragon-things, not like great rain stone, but different. Soo-say tell us maybe we see ourselves there, but not like in a shiny. Soo-say mean we could see what we are like many years from now.You take us there? We remember shrine to bronze dragon-things in place called Dragonblight. Soo-say say great rain stone show him shrine to northeast of Wyrmrest Temple, or northwest of place dryskins call Wintergarde Keep. We go?13934When Kekek was a pup, he sometimes heard elders talking about a far-off shrine. Sometimes they say that bronze dragon-things there know all about future.Kekek tell you he be great warrior, now we go see. Bronze dragon-thing shrine somewhere in Dragonblight, northeast of dragon-thing temple called Wyrmrest, also northwest of man-town called Wintergarde.We go there, see future. Prove orphan-lady wrong about Kekek. Kekek warrior, not bully.13935We have been using the power of the Forest Heart to defend the tree from the Horde, but its power is not without limit. We must use it to take the fight to them!Shadumbra, the great cat of the forest, prowls nearby. It is from her that we shall draw our inspiration. You will become one with the shade of Shadumbra. You will take the essence of the panther into you and lay waste to those who dare attack the might of Ashenvale!13936Delays, delays, delays! I'm at wit's end!I was told that this goblin was brilliant - that he'd come up with gadgets sure to shock the enemy into submission. So far he's produced nothing but empty promises. If he comes up empty-handed again, I'm going to toss him off the cliff!You go and speak to him, . Let him know that my fuse is running short!13937We have time for one more stop? We heard Dalaran has toy store, but we never get to go there. Orphan mistress says too many orphans would crowd the store. Maybe we can go, just us?We can have a small paper zeppelin? We think they have those at Wonderworks in Dalaran. We always wanted to play with one. Maybe you throw one to us?13938You take Kekek one more place? Orphan lady say Dalaran have toy store called Wonderworks, but Kekek never seen it. She say that if one orphan go, she have to take everyone. Maybe you take Kekek?Kekek seen other children playing with small paper zeppelin? Kekek hear those come from Wonderworks. Maybe you get one and throw it around with Kekek?13940Hold on tight, .  The journey back to the waking world can be a little rough on unprepared minds and bodies.13942I'm definitely on to something here!I have enough volatile elements salvaged from our arsenal to make the explosives Goggath wants, but I need to stabilize it and pack it into bombs.What I need is some clay - and not just any clay... moon-kissed clay.It's only found on the northern banks of Astranaar Lake, and it possesses the qualities I need to bring out the full potential of my discovery!13943Our forces are not ready to assault Astranaar just yet, . They know we're coming, though, and they're not content to sit and wait for us. At the base of this cliff they've created a camp from which they launch bothersome attacks by the light of the moon.Before these skirmishes bolster their confidence any further, I want you to visit them with the wrath of the Horde! Return to me when the elves have been humbled a bit.13944I've done it! This should satisfy even Goggath!We just need a test that will sufficiently show off our efforts... ahh - the wagon!The bossman's wanted that rotted out piece of junk hauled off for days. Use my explosives to get rid of it, then see what the captain has to say!13945The Gnarlpine aggression is limiting our options. None of our kind are eager to bring blade and arrow against creatures that were once our friends, but I grow fearful that they are going to set their sights on Dolanaar soon.The biggest concern to me are the furbolg in Ban'ethil Hollow and Ban'ethil Barrow Dens. I need you to travel to the west, make your way into the Barrow Den, and kill as many of the Gnarlpine as you can. We probably won't have many more chances to limit their strength - be swift.13946I'm glad you were willing to atone for your mistake - it speaks a great deal about your character.I have another task for you. I have gathered some ireroot seeds. They are somewhat like fel cones, but quite a bit more potent. Nature often responds very negatively to demons, and these ireroot seeds prompt a very concentrated form of that reprisal.To our north, in Fel Rock, there are grellkin that are far beyond redemption. Use the ireroot seeds to route them before they become a more serious threat.13947So, Tweedle finally came through on those explosives, eh?They couldn't have come at a better time. The elves of Astranaar are preparing to make a devastating assault on our camp as we speak.Drop our new weapon on them from the skies! The destruction of Astranaar will be a dagger in the heart of night elves everywhere!Speak with Thraka when you're ready to begin the assault.Aim true, .13948The cultists appear to be digging out the remains of a being known as Soggoth the Slitherer.Perhaps their superiors on the rafters above have more information.13949Have you ever used one of these, ? It's a beast. Hell with a handgrip. Too heavy to use on foot, but perfect when riding at the head of a caravan. I call it my 'street sweeper.'We need to get those supplies you've collected to the Crossroads, and I expect trouble. I'd like for you to ride shotgun. Literally! Say the word when you're ready and I'll put you at the head of our next caravan.13950Orphanage gets real lonely, you know? Sometimes we want to go places, meet new friends.Maybe you can take us somewheres with other hatchlings? We heard about a place called Winterfin Retreat, in the big Borean Tundra.

We want to see her! Would you take us to the top of Wyrmrest Temple? We remember Soo-say telling us the temple-thing was in the middle of Dragonblight.We really want to meet dragon queen. She must be so big and pretty. Maybe she help us find new parents.You take us?13955Kekek always liked dragons. Always wanted to be one, but orphan-lady said no. But she did say maybe you take Kekek to meet dragon queen.Kekek think orphan-lady have good idea for once. You take Kekek to Wyrmrest Temple in the middle of Dragonblight? Fly all the way to top to meet dragon queen. She must be really big, to be queen of all dragons. Kekek can't wait to see!13956High-Oracle Soo-say always tell us about how Great Ones built shrines and we give them shinies, but he never see Great Ones. No one see Great Ones, but maybe you know how to find one?Soo-say told us the Great Ones made a waygate and put it in the center of the southern part of Sholazar.

We go visit and learn how to hunt like Hemet?13958We have the enemy on their heels. Victory is within sight!It is not yet time to celebrate though, . There remains much to be done before the Horde can lay claim to Ashenvale.At Raynewood Retreat to the east a battle has been joined. Reports indicate many Horde wounded.Take these medical supplies there and give them to Thagg. Tell him of our assault on Astranaar. It may help to bolster morale.13959We had the best time with you, . We wish you could be our  now, but you have to take us back to Orphan Matron Aria in Dalaran.Maybe you could come visit us again sometime?

Club the beast unconscious and bring him to me.13962The triage kits will help us keep up the fight, but we are at a stalemate.The dryads die easy enough, but their leader is resurrecting them soon after they fall. We face an endless stream of the vermin!Keeper Ordanus hides in that mutated tree. Our efforts to fight our way to him have been in vain. Perhaps you could work your way to him while we contend with his dryads...Surely, this is child's play for someone who has conquered Astranaar. No?13963I suppose he'll come around with some cold water to the face. What do you think he'll tell us?I'll secure him inside our livestock pen behind me here.

Under his leadership, he's turned them into little more than brigands. There's no negotiating with his type; Tortusk must be destroyed.If our prisoner is to be believed, you'll find Tortusk southeast of here at a place called Thorn Hill. Search the bluffs where he has a commanding view of the road. Kill him, , and the immediate threat should cease.13969Friend, if you are traveling south to Thorn Hill, I was wondering if you could locate one of our missing kodos?

I've already eaten everything they made for me!Might I trouble you for some more of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful...Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.14184Careless... I was shot down by Alliance fire...You must... inform my sister.Take my mount, ... he'll bring you to her...14188This cannot be!My dear brother - slain by Alliance scum!They must be made to suffer, ! Find a way to bring them pain! I shall not rest until it is so...Furien had been researching ancient artifacts in the eastern regions before his death. Speak to Sorrem. Perhaps he can direct you in my brother's footsteps.14189It is true that Furien dedicated his last days to a special research project. What that was, he would not share with me.Fortunately, I was able to recover his journal, but it's written in a code that I cannot decipher.Perhaps there is a clue to its translation in the region to the east where he spent his time.Take the journal, , and speak with Narimar when you are ready to investigate this mystery.14190There's got to be a way to reverse the basilisks' stonification. Those irritating night elf saboteurs who have been lurking around my mine must know something we don't. They seem to be immune to the gaze of the beast!I want you to find out their secret, . Pick off a few of the Talrendis saboteurs skulking about in the rear of the strip mine and get a sample of whatever charm or ding-dong they're wearing to give them immunity. Radio me from the main forge building once you're successful.14191You can decipher bits and pieces of the text, but it will require extensive study before Furien's work becomes coherent.For now, as you look off to the northeast, you think you can make out some of the ruins depicted in the journal.From what you can tell, these ruins seem to have been of some significance to Furien's research.14192If that prism of yours is tuned to refract a basilisk's gaze, we can use its crystal properties to reverse the process. All we need is a source of power.In the weapons cabinet to your right, you'll find our prototype laser mining drill. I loved that thing but the near daily dismemberments got to be a real bother. Grab the laser drill and swap out the lens with that crystal of yours...14193The markings on the ruins here make one thing clear: There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune.It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash.Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree....14194Hey , you got that gun? Good! Don't point it directly at your eye.Aim that baby at my stonified workers and the refracted light should reverse the petrification process. Or it will melt them. Whatever. Return my workers to a state of profitability! And if the refleshification process makes them crazy-go-nuts, they should be killed for insurance purposes. Horzak OUT!14195Something has changed... perhaps a side-effect of Elune's cleansing ritual.While it's by no means perfect yet, your understanding of the ancient language in the journal has vastly improved.The ruins in the northern mountains of Sargeron appear to be the main focus of Furien's enthusiasm. Something there, he felt, would aid him in driving the Alliance from this region.You close the journal determined to find this ruin and discover its secrets.14196You are now able to understand the script in which the journal was written.Along the runestone, it is explained that the monument's gemstones were imbued with the power to summon a firestorm.The storm could grow to be a mighty weapon either through sustained worship of Elune, or charged by spiritual energies of the fallen.Looking down upon the newly revealed ghosts of Elune's disciples, you reason that you have neither the time, nor the inclination to worship the goddess of your enemy....14197Mountainfoot iron is a brittle alloy, but with the right bribes it meets goblin safety standards. Zignibble here is having trouble on the production end of things, but that doesn't change any of my deadlines. I've got a quota to fill!Head down into the Mountainfoot Strip Mine and gather up any ingots of Mountainfoot iron you find. There should be piles of it smelted and ready for shipment.14198You cannot help but to feel a twinge of pride, having unlocked this long lost secret of the ancient worshippers of Elune.You now possess the power to inflict great damage upon your enemy.As it was Furien's tireless work that made this possible, it only seems right that the weapon should be unleashed upon those who took his life.The Alliance scum at Nijel's Point shall pay for their offenses against the Horde!1420014201The ruins around Lake Mennar, to our east, have a tale to tell. The lesser races - like those clumsy dwarves - would go after the truth with picks and shovels.  We'll be using more elegant methods.My scrying magic is somewhat rusty, but with the right trinket I should be able to peer through the shrouds of time. The bones of my forefathers have long since rotted away but some of their personal treasures may remain - bring me some.14202All these cruddy ancient ruins have to be bulldozed if we're ever to see Azshara's full potential. Look on my map here - you see Lake Mennar, to the East? I'll tell you what I see: a future rocket fuel depot!But we need an accurate lay of the land before we can clearcut, bulldoze, landfill, and pave over that lake. All of my surveyors have been spooked off by the oogly-boogleys haunting that area. Escort one of my Jr. grade surveyors to the area and take readings from the equipment that's been set up.14203This appears to be the remains of a mixture for potent wine.  Perhaps the proprietor of One More Glass in Dalaran would be interested in it....14204He turned into one of them... didn't he?  How do we even begin to fight an enemy that can do this to us?My father's arsenal's certainly a good start, I suppose.Worgen are hiding in the alleys ahead.  Take one of my mastiffs to find them more easily.We're going to need to clear the way ahead if we're going to move these cannons above ground.14209Those ancient ruins have survived ten thousand years of wind and weather, so I brought out my biggest and bestest bulldozer to flatten 'em. I call her \"Margene.\"But my dozer's been letting me down lately, . The moment I drove her into those haunted woods, her engine seized up with a spine-chilling howl. Now my engineers tell me something's clogging her valves. Go over there and inspect Margene's engine compartment, and bring me back a sample of whatever gunk has her stalled.14212You don't have to do this, .  You've done more than enough already.But if you decide to stay... I'd be a fool to turn you away.My men have fortified their position inside the cathedral and are ready for what comes next.I'm about to head there and take as many of these flea-ridden devils with me as I can.  You're welcome to come along for the ride.14213According to Furien's Journal, this ancient brazier was placed here for the performing of sacrifices.As far as you can make out from the entry, a blessing is bestowed upon the being who places the flesh of Elune's enemies on the brazier's burning embers.Looking around, you determine that the satyrs who now possess this region would likely qualify.14214It's time, .  We'll take it from here.Tell King Greymane that my father's arsenal will be at his disposal.  There's more than enough firepower here to blow the worgen from here to the north sea.14215The runes on this ring you found are still legible: it was given to \"Kalytha\" when she was granted admission to the Academy. With the right spell or two, this personal trinket of hers is the gateway to her soul.Take the ring back to Lake Mennar. Kalytha's spirit should now be visible to you on the shore of the lake. Touch her and the ring will allow you to see the world as she sees it, forever reliving her final hours. Probe her mind, ! Speak to the others and learn the secrets of Lake Mennar...14216Before she died, Kalytha was charged with burying something at the bottom of the lake, a powerful artifact that the archmages of Mennar spent their last moments creating. No doubt Malynea Skyreaver will want to see the artifact, presuming it still exists. You resolve to search the bottom of Lake Mennar for the Sarcen Stone.14217You find it most amusing to think that this ancient relic is bestowing upon you a blessing meant for your enemies.You determine to make as much as you can of this unintentional gift.14218The time has come, .  If we're going to put a dent in their numbers, the time is now.We have the position.We have the firepower.All that remains to be seen is whether we have the courage... and I sure don't see a coward standing in front of me.14219You immediately recognize this statue from a sketch in Furien's Journal.Though the words associated with the entry elude you, the sketch seems self-explanatory. After battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort.As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack....1422014221We had enough ammunition to carry on the civil war for another month.  Yet the worgen's numbers are such that we're nearly spent.We don't want to be caught out here in the open when that happens.  Fall back inside the cathedral and report to the boss.  I'm sure old Crowley will know what to do next.14222We've got a good chokepoint here, .  Feel free to say a prayer if that's your sort of thing.Take courage and let's kill these mutts.14223We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the Horde launches its Desolace campaign, our work here will ensure that nothing takes us by surprise.Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at their stronghold to the east. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor.Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now!14225With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region.He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking.This cannot wait for the Horde's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat.14226Look at you. Doing errands. Quite responsible of you. You're moving up up up, you are... up up!There be demons ahead! Demons of many unpleasant kinds. Demons that would quite like your innards! Legash demons of a southeasternly heading! But do not worry. No no, no reason to worry, for I shall provide you with a companion!Point, bugify, squash. Point, bugify, squash! Quite efficient. Quite messy too... but again, worry not. No no, worry not, for afterwards, we don't have to clean up!14227So it's true....The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess.Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs!Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted.14230The local demons seem to get quite a kick out of stealing all of our arcane manuals. I highly doubt most of them can even read, so they're probably doing it just to spite us.I could care less about most of the books they've taken, but they took an Abjurer's Manual that I'm going to need if there's any hope of keeping apprentices like you alive amidst Xylem's \"trials.\" Find the demons at the Lagash Encampment to the southeast and retrieve the Abjurer's Manual.That's all. Scoot.1423114232Sorrem has made no secret of his disdain for the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress.Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him.14233Looking through the dead orc's belongings, you find a field journal. Though it is heavily water damaged, the writing is still legible, if barely.Flipping through the pages, an interesting story unfolds. Good thing you decided to study Orcish.Like the Trade Prince's yacht, the orcs were fired upon by Alliance warships. You do remember an orc warship that you passed right before the Alliance opened fire. Maybe they were firing on the orcs instead of your ship?Stupid orcs! They got you sunk!14234I hate to ask you to do this, but I guess it's why they pay you the big bucks. Can you deliver that dead orc's field journal to whoever is in charge up at their camp?Based on the writing in the book, they should be located at the top of the island, up the incline past the Kaja'mite cavern to the southeast.Good luck, . I always liked you.14235Our hunter, Kilag Gorefang, and a few scouts, traveled into the vale down the path to the west. They're ...searching for... 'precious cargo'... that we were guarding when the filthy Alliance sunk our ship.The way is blocked by deadly plants and they have not been able to break through., prove your worth as a goblin and a . Journey into the Vicious Vale to find Kilag.14236Now is the time for creative solutions. Pull something out of that belt and get to work!14237Kilag should be in position by now. It is time for you to move forward to the Wild Overlook. The rest of us will pack up here and move out soon.Just follow the path northwest through the Vicious Vale. Not so vicious any longer thanks to you, eh?Kilag and his scouts will be keeping themselves hidden just off the path, but the SI:7 assassins are sure to spot them soon, so hurry!14238Keep your voice down. The glen north and west of here is crawling with Alliance assassins.Unfortunately, we haven't been able to spot them. The cowards! They hide and won't fight face-to-face.You goblins are known for your wondrous goggles. Surely you have a pair that will allow you to see them?I need you to team up with one of my scouts and kill any of the SI:7 assassins that you spot.1423914240I sent Scout Brax forward along the road to the cliffs overlooking the beach to the west.I am going to put you onto Bastia. Travel down the path and let Brax know that we are going to take a different route.We'll see you at the attack on the Alliance beachhead!14241The Alliance have stolen something of vital importance to the Horde. It is being held out on their ships.At the other end of the beach is a gyrochoppa. Our battlesworn will cover your approach.Go retrieve the keys to the flying machine from one of their operatives.Fly out to their flagship, the Vengeance Wake, and retrieve our precious cargo!14242They said that their \"precious cargo\", whatever that is, is being held out on the Alliance ship, the Vengeance Wake.There's only one thing to do... fly this thing out there and retrieve it!14243Brothers of Earth and Fire, hear me! Sisters of the Water and Air, heed my call!Azeroth stands on the brink, its existence near an end! Lend me your power as in times past with my ancient ancestors. Allow me to channel your will through this child of Kezan.Let us put an end to those who would keep us from healing the world!14244While you were rescuing the Warchief and saving us all from the Alliance, Foreman Dampwick built this rocket sling to shoot us over the shark-infested strait to the bigger island.Luckily for us, the foreman managed to salvage a Town-In-A-Box from the shipwreck. Once you get it set up, we'll have a town of our own. I can't wait to sleep in a bed again!Dampwick's down there at the Landing Site, waiting for you. Why don't you take the next rocket over?14245The trade prince had an entire town-in-a-box in the ship's hold! I managed to recover it while you were out saving all of our skins.Do you want to do the honors? All you have to do is climb to the top of that huge pile of explosives and push the plunger, and whamo kablamo, instant town!14246As the region becomes more lush, the creatures of the desert are being forced into increasingly confined spaces.A particularly distressing result is the impending extinction of the local swoops. Predators feast on the birds and their eggs when they take nest.I have acquired some swoop eggs from Tanaris and coated them with an irresistible pheromone. Place one in each nest you find, then protect it until a swoop comes to carry it off.You will be doing a service to the balance of this land.14247By authority of the Cenarion Circle, I am charged with turning these harsh lands into lush prairie.The lands south of here welcomed the growth, but something here is fighting back - resisting the replenishment.Perhaps your eyes can succeed where mine have failed.Please, . Scour these lands and discover the source of the desert's stubbornness.14248Great news! Foreman Dampwick has uncovered a cave full of kaja'mite on the island! What are the odds?Of course, there's a downside. He took some of the survivors with him to help mine the ore, but none of them have made it out.Crazy as it sounds, the foreman said that there are monkeys in the cave... with mining picks! They're mining the kaja'mite! How is that even possible?Can you head southeast to the cavern? The foreman is standing just outside the entrance.14249I'd be amazing! At archmagery. Amazing! He won't even talk to me because I don't have a stupid robe and hat. Pffft.The most amazing archmage this land has ever seen can't just have any robe and hat. I need to show him that I'm something special, and I know just how to do it.Go out there and kill some of those hippogryph things. Bring me back a TON of feathers.You heard me! A whole bunch of feathers! Go go, I'll have the robe ready for them by the time you get back.14250We're going to need some more animate basalt. There's only one reliable source for that in the area, a mountain giant named Balboa. We can't be killing the mountain giant if we want to keep stocked in the stuff long term, so we've just been chipping off pieces at a time.You'll be able to see his path northeast and east of here. Find him, place the charge ahead on the path, and then hide until it goes off. Once he's cleared the area, you should be able to retrieve the basalt and bring it back to me.14251There's never been danger of centaur attack this far north before. Someone put 'em up to it, I just know it!Regardless, I'm wiped out. I had everything invested in this haul.Fortunately, there's one thing no centaur can take from me and that's goblin ingenuity! I'll start from scratch and build an empire!There's always a market for poison. Whatdya say, friend?14252I need a crateload of tail, ! And not just any kind of tail. The tail I'm after needs to be old - ancient even. The more decrepit the better.The scales of a basilisk's tail are unique in that they harden with age without becoming brittle. The hardened scales are ideal for the production of certain armors.It's been many years since I've been reduced to peddling lizard scales, but who knows, maybe it'll build even more character in me! If that's even possible....14253Say, , while you're out there exploring the desert wastes, do me a favor?Keep an eye out for Dread Swoops. Their oily feathers make for the best fletching, and to the right buyer they can fetch a handsome price.Lucky for you, I know all of the right buyers!14254You have a strong feeling that this stone is somehow responsible for the region's refusal to accept the encroaching regrowth.Looking off to the west, you notice a trail of smoldering debris that appears to be related to this mystery.You surmise that clearing the debris might assist Thunk's efforts here.And who knows what this stuff might be good for?14255We have plenty of enemies in this region without raising the ire of the Cenarion Circle.When we established our post here, we were asked to keep a watch over one of their researchers.Korrah was last seen at the tower to the west. Do be a dear and pay her a visit. It's been some time since we've bothered to check on her.14256I am all that remains of my company, sent to monitor the many changes on this coast of Desolace.I have reported of the dramatic increase of naga here, but to no effect.My peers are focused on other crises, so I must ask you, a stranger, to assist me in my research.First, though, allow me to show you the threat we face.14257Time and again, the naga have proven to be enemies to the balance of nature. I have no qualms with the spilling of their blood.Your best efforts though, would barely put a dent in their forces here. Where one falls, two seem to rise in their place.I have a plan, . Your objective is not merely to take the lives of the enemy, but to gather components necessary for the next stage of our investigation....14258The Naga started making a move on the peninsula here after we finished building this rocketway terminal. But there's no problem in this world that can't be solved with gratuitous firepower! That's what my daddy used to say. Before the accident.I'm running short on supplies, though. Do me a favor and collect the mortar shells I left stockpiled in the Secret Lab just west of here. Keep me supplied and I'll let you call in the artillery strikes!14260I have fashioned a charm that will allow you to infiltrate the naga, giving you the appearance of one of their own.With this disguise, you will be able to speak and understand their language. They will be unable to discern your true identity.But beware! The sharks and other sea creatures here will expose you for all to see. Avoid them at all costs.Now go. Speak to the Priestess of Azshara and do what you must to learn of their purposes here.14261I've got the perfect solution to our drake problem. My very own Cryomatic 16.I originally developed it to freeze my workers during transport and between shifts so that I wouldn't have to feed and entertain them, but there were... complications. It should be perfect for dropping these drakes out of the sky though!14262It tries my patience, defending against creatures who can disappear into the sea at will and emerge where they please. But I will not back down until their like has been wiped from Azshara.Spitelash Naga have slithered up the cliff walls and are besieging this post from the east. Destroy them, . Gut them head to tail, so that they may know the full fury of my Horde.14263Living Ire Thyme. I must have more! Be quick about it, will you?14264Neptulon's minions have arrived here and are doing all they can to thwart us. Clearly, they've discovered our motives.This only confirms my suspicion that what we seek is indeed somewhere in these ruins!These water elementals are no match for our forces! Take this trident and use it to destroy the worthless servants of the Tidehunter.When we find what we seek here, Neptulon himself shall fear for his life!14265Most of us made it here alive... but there are worgen on this side of the city as well.We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.That reminds me, someone was asking about you.  A fellow by the name of Cleese said you were one of his students and wanted to make sure you were all right.14266You're alive, !  That must mean I did something right.It's a shame our lessons were cut off a little short.  But, as you go and learn on your own, you'll start to discover new techniques.Go get some more experience, learn something new, and then try it out against the bloodfang worgen to our west.14267The Naga invaders have set up a series of shrines along the cliffs. I don't know their purpose, , but I believe they're strengthening our foes. I need someone to get in there and root out this threat.One nearby shrine is lightly defended: Cross the first bridge east of here and then head north towards the bay. You'll find it on a small outcropping. Investigate that shrine and come back with some info I can use.14268Queen Azshara seeks entrance into the plane of water, for what I do not know.She believes that the ancients held the keys to finding its location.I have personally been charged with scouring the ruins in this region, and none shall rest until we discover the secrets we seek!Submerged just to the north are a concentration of ruins. Use this staff to search through the rubble.Return to me only when you have located that which we seek!14269Most of us made it here alive... but there are worgen on this side of the city as well.We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.That reminds me, someone was asking about you.  A woman named Loren... she seemed a little disappointed when I told her you were all right.I think she mentioned she owes you money.14270The air around this strange stone crackles with energy. The stone itself is smooth and icy cold. It pulses periodically as you run your hands over it, like the crashing of surf.A wedge-shaped piece appears to be missing from the top surface of the artifact. This 'keystone shard' is likely the key to unlocking the secrets of the stone. Search the grounds near the temple and locate the keystone shard.14271A magical barrier pulses around you, chilling your bones. You feel secure behind this enchanted wall.Torg Twocrush will want to know what you've discovered here!14272Good to see you alive!No, of course I don't have that gold I owe you.  Now's not really the time to bring that up is it?Listen, maybe I can show you the ropes, save your skin with all the carnage going on. As you learn how to fight, you'll start to learn new things. Go get some more experience, and then when you figure out something new, try it on the Bloodfang Worgen. I'll be watching14273Most of us made it here alive... but there are worgen on this side of the city as well.We're going to continue heading south once everyone's accounted for.That reminds me, someone was asking about you.  A strange fellow named Vitus... he was really giving me the creeps.He kept talking about some \"forbidden knowledge\" he'd uncovered.14274It is true then!  You live!I never got a chance to share my greatest discovery with you.  After I began my training, and began to become accomplished, I heard the voice Balcephoth of the felshadows in my head... he taught me the forbidden secrets of...Corruption!Go now, gain some more experience, maybe you'll learn a new spell, too.

Well I kind of thought so. Firsts are first, you touch the fire crystal and the portal to the trial opens.To beat this trial, you have to hop around in the fire runes without getting hit by the fire. If you stay unflamed long enough, you win!There are little signs to help you - fire hopping to its new rune, fizzles when a rune goes cold. You can figure that stuff out if you want. Or just guess! That's what most people do.14301It is done! Together we were able to bring down a dangerous adversary.Neptulon himself shall hear of your exploits here, . Allow me to extend you his thanks...You should leave now. This place will not remain safe for long. Soon, the naga will seek vengeance for their priestess.14302You have accomplished much in your efforts against the naga, . But I fear it is not nearly enough....This is my official assessment of the naga presence.I'm confident that my peers in the wildlands will take the necessary action.Bring this to Karnum at the grove in the center of the Cenarion Wildlands to the southeast.

Here, the wildlife has responded to their new environment in strange and sometimes exciting ways.I am particularly interested in the Rejuvenated Thunder Lizards that roam just to the west.I need a sample of their blood.You may begin helping me by using this jar of leeches on a few of them.Once they've filled on the blood of those beasts, return them to me.14305No one knows better than the Cenarion Circle that this lush oasis could dry up as quickly as it appeared.We must take care not to interfere with the processes taking place here, but to support and preserve them,A new species of plant, very plentiful in the surrounding region, has appeared since the great change.Collect samples of these for me, that I might study them and learn what they have to teach us,14306With such an abrupt change to the ecology, it is to be expected that some of the flora and fauna don't react as well as we'd hope.The uprooted lashers are a troublesome example of this. Roaming the fields to the east and south they are a detriment to the region and must be disposed of.While you're about, please deal with any of these pests that you find.14307The winds of change are blowing, . Of that there can be no doubt.There are many pressing issues vying for our attention and action. Chief among them is the spreading of our growing oasis.Its growth has surpassed our hopes as well as our understanding, yet now it faces opposition.To the west, where the grass meets the sand, whirlwinds prevent its penetration into the desert.Go and eliminate this hostile obstacle to life!14308Did you see the explosions on the way in? The Secret Lab is engulfed in flames! Again! If we don't stamp out those flames we're going to hit critical temperatacity and resonate into a meltdown cascade.Here, I'm entrusting you with a canister of experimental hypercooled pressurized liquigel: The most volatile fire retardant known to science! (Keep that canister away from open flame.) Put out the fires and hose down my interns, then contact me via the squawkbox in central control.14309As you have by now witnessed, the rapid changes to this region can have both positive and negative effects on the native creatures.To the south and east of here, enraged kodo are a constant threat to anyone nearby.It's time to put my theory to the test. I've used the rejuvenated thunder lizard's blood in the making of this concoction. I'm hoping it will soothe the kodo when they eat it.Place it near an enraged kodo and make sure you do it from a safe distance!14310Once we flush the central reactor, I need you to return the core to me. It's 100% refined azsharite crystal, which is both powerful and dangerous. And lovely. Oh precious azsharite, the shaper of worlds to come!The giant lever to your left will dump the core and send it to me via the rail system. The core will be superheated, so you'll need to periodically douse it with the Fireliminator on the way here... don't let it reach critical temperature!14311What a glorious time we live in!The former wastelands of Desolace are blooming, bursting with life. Imagine, , if all of Azeroth's wastelands awoke in such a fashion! Perhaps someday...It's true that there are weighty issues at hand here, but why not take a moment to appreciate the wondrous miracle we are witnessing?In fact, why not take part in it? Here are some Cenarion Seeds. Use them at the more fertile spots of the wildlands.Perfect medicine for lifting a weary soul!14312I have heard of your exploits here in Desolace, . We are in your debt.I'm afraid I must involve you in yet another crisis, one more pressing than the rest.The landscape is not all that has changed here of late. Old conflicts have made way for new, more dire ones. I should allow our guest to explain further....Khan Leh'prah is among the last of the Kolkar tribe that once possessed all of eastern Desolace. We found him near death on our borders. Listen to his words.14313So Krennan's potion did not kill you?  Well, I suppose that means the human inside of you is in control then.I guess I won't be shooting you after all.  At least not yet.Go speak to Krennan Aranas and give him the good news.  He's in charge of the house where we keep... your kind.Just remember, .  I've got my eye on you.  You so much as try anything funny and you'll get a bullet between the eyes.14314It began with a dream that repeatedly warned me of the danger to come. I saw the demonic legions bearing down upon our kind, overrunning our lands.The dream has become real. The Burning Blade and their demon masters have pushed the Magram out of their lands in the south. In turn, the Magram have defeated my people and taken over our homes.The fight was ferocious. Only a handful of the Kolkar still live. I would ask that you visit what was once my land in the east, and free them from their prison.14316Since the demons have invaded their lands, the Magram have broken all ties with any outsiders.They are untrusting and hostile and have taken to stealing from others instead of providing for themselves.Many of our needed supplies have gone missing of late and we suspect that the Magram are to blame.Please, , go to their lands in the east and search for our belongings.14318There is but one way to win the trust and loyalty of the Magram.It must be beaten out of them.They have suffered many losses in their war against my clan. They now possess an unfamiliar land, where they struggle just to feed themselves.Now is the time to strike.Speak to me when you are ready, then ride in and plant my spear in the Fatherstone. If we can kill enough of them, their Khan will submit to our will.14319Listen, .  I'm not going to beat around the bush.There's a good chance the potion Krennan made for you wasn't a complete success.  Or perhaps you need more of it.Either way, he's probably better equipped to advise you than I am.  Go see him.14320Ah, yes.  The effects of the Curse cannot ever be fully cured as far as we know.With treatment, however, your mind will remain yours... and not that of a wild animal.We are fortunate that the treatment worked on you.  Normally, I can only treat recent infections.We'll need to continue your medication if we're to have you reverse the Curse.I will need mandrake essence to brew another batch of my serum for you.  You will find a crate stashed beneath a shed southwest of town.1432114322I was trying to domesticate the indigenous hippogryphs here using a series of debilitating electrical shocks, when for some reason they went berserk! Now my test subjects are tearing up this place for no good reason! , go slaughter my failed experiments before they find me.14323One other thing I need. Hot water.Not easy around here. Not hot springs, no friends to share. One good way though. Have this sponge... it's ultra absorbent! Use it to go soak Vile Splashes at the sandbar eastish.With enough, go squeeze them out over near the tower to summon jumbo elemental. He has hot water.14324Ergll indicated that you should be able to use the Engorged Azshara Sea Sponge to summon a \"jumbo\" elemental near the Tower of Eldara to the northeast.14325No one need lecture us about the demons, . It is they who drove our clan from our ancestral lands.It is they who forced us to take over the Kolkar wastelands, where we struggle just to exist.The war against the Kolkar took a heavy toll on my people. What few of us remain are weary and hungry.Bring food for my people and then we shall discuss the demons.14326I never thought that I would be a prisoner of the Alliance again. I cannot begin to express my gratitude to you... , is it?I will meet you up top and from there we will deal with them.14327It would seem that we have no choice.As reluctant as I am to cooperate with the Kolkar, there is wisdom in the words of their Khan.You may give him my word that we shall lend our spears to the battle.14328The Gelkis reside in southwest Desolace. They are just as stubborn as the Magram, and since they have not suffered war and relocation, they are considerably stronger.Humbling the Gelkis will require an extreme show of force.Khan Shodo and his three sons rule the clan. Shodo is aging, and suffers from old war wounds. He never leaves the depths of his cave. The strength of his rule lies in his sons.Slay them, and persuade the Khan to commit to our cause.14329It matters not to me what becomes of this land now. I have failed my clan and my forefathers....There is but one thing left in this world that might bring my old soul hope, and she's likely dead as well.My precious daughter, Kherrah, was taken from me by the Maraudine clan. If you can bring her back to me alive, I shall consider your proposal.14330You've discovered the location of Khan Shodo's daughter, Kherrah. She is being held behind the doors to Maraudon!The rescue attempt is certain to be risky, but if you seek the Gelkis clan's cooperation, you must free the Khan's daughter.14332I agree with the words of the Kolkar Khan. The time for ancient grudges is over. It is a shame that it has taken a demonic crisis to unite the tribes.I shall return to my father and convince him to join your cause. You have my word that he will comply.Return to Khan Leh'prah and inform him that the Gelkis will be ready when called upon.14333The Maraudine have raided the Gelkis camps for many years, stealing anything they could get their hands on.One of their favorite torments is to take these relics of power which the Gelkis hold sacred, and bring them here to be defiled.The Gelkis clan would certainly be grateful if you were to find and destroy these defiled artifacts.14334Ahoy, mon!You think you be able ta do something for da village here?Most whales we can handle fine, but there be a special whale out there that be too big for our spears.Blubbergut been gettin' bigger an' bigger - eatin' up the fish we use to live on!Get out there and find the thing, then make him pay for his gluttony!14335As you have no doubt noticed by now, the recent changes to the land have had many side-effects. Some of these are beneficial, while others pose serious problems.Just south of the village the local lobstrok are emerging from the sea and choking off the road to the village.Please, , go and thin the numbers of this pest.14336The reefs have always protected us from a coastal attack.  The earthquakes must've opened a passage for the Forsaken ships.Quick, .  Slow down the attackers while I get the rest of the militia ready.I think I can hear the Prince and some of our men engaging the Forsaken even as we speak.  Speak to Liam and see how you can be of use.Oh... and make sure he doesn't get himself killed.  I'm afraid he might be a little reckless in his current state.14337Hello again, .I have received news that Shadowprey Village is in need of some assistance. Our hands are more than full here, so I must call upon you to travel there and be of assistance to them.The village lies on the coast to the southwest of here. When you arrive, seek out the one named Mai'Lahii.14338Greetings, .It is good to see that you still draw breath. The time has come for me to call upon your services.Just southwest of this glade stands Ghost Walker Post. There you will find a forsaken by the name of Maurin Bonesplitter.He may have a solution for one of the problems we face here.Speak with him and do what you can to assist him.14339As fate would have it, there's a special deed that needs doing - one that will benefit the Cenarion Circle as well as myself.You see, , I am under pressure to create a special... concoction, shall we say. I believe my work to be complete, but I need to have it tested to be certain.The target of this test is to be the naga, who threaten this region from the west. Their demise would surely aid the Circle.First though, I need a delivery device. Hollow horns from the dying kodo should do nicely.14340Every man's got to learn his own lessons I suppose.Here, take my wizard hat. I have no doubt that he'll take you on as an apprentice if you look the role... you just might have to jump through some hoops first. Tiny flaming hoops, suspended over spikes, with spinning blades on the other side.You should be able to find an image of Xylem on top of that hill to the northeast.14341Pardon me, young .I'm in need of a little help. I've just finished filling an order for harnesses that must be delivered right away.I'm a bit old for the trip, especially considering how dangerous things have become lately.Would you mind?They need to go to Smeed, a goblin who lives just southeast of here.14342The demons are on the move, !If nothing is done, we'll be overrun in a matter of weeks. I've just returned from Mannoroc Coven, where the infernals there are falling from the sky!We need to at least buy ourselves some time. Get down there and pick up where I left off!14343Here you are, .Bring these to Karnum. It's up to him how he wants to use them on the naga. I'll be watching to gauge the effectiveness of my formula!14344You recognize this as the essence of a summoned demon.Dangerous and rarely understood energies weave in and out of its surface.As you gaze upon it, a vision fills your mind - an image of yourself controlling demonic minions. A rush of excitement flows through you as you imagine wielding such power.Looking at your surroundings, you wonder how this treasure might be used against this demonic enemy....14345Delicious!Azy always trying to get his hands on magic artifacts. Said he was trying to make friends with that archmage person. Xylem!Xylem has LOTS of apprentices. Takes in all kinds, burns'm out, leaves them wandering all over. High turnover.Last one was last night. Headed over towards that big goblin tower construction thing, way west. Maybe he'll help you meet Xylem? Maybe Xylem knows where Azy is?Play nice!14346As you of course know, , the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea!When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault. Once there, use Maurin's Concoction to teach them a lesson they shall not soon forget.14347!  I'm still not sure if you're alive or dead... human or worgen...I'm not even sure if I'm really awake.  But THIS I am sure of...We're going to kill a great many of these motherless Forsaken.14348Look here, .  The big fat ones -- abominations, they're called -- they don't go down easy, so don't tackle them on your own.But I have an idea so crazy it might just work.  Or it might get you killed, if we're not careful, I suppose.There's barrels of gunpowder beneath the sheds and by the windmills.  Grab them and toss 'em right on the abominations' heads.  I'll take care of the rest with this trusty old blunderbuss.14354Simply intolerable!Satyrs of all things, desecrating our sacred lands...Their days are numbered, . I can assure you of that. As soon as we have the numbers, I shall lead a charge that will rid this land of the wicked creatures.For now, though, perhaps you could put my mind at ease?Travel just east of here to Sargeron and scour the ruins. Find the relics of Elune and ensure that they are in good condition.I'll pay you well for this favor.14357The handmaiden of Elune! It's even more glorious than the stories tell.The legends surrounding this relic come to your mind as you draw near it:In ancient time, after battle, the enemies' weapons were to be cast upon the basin in exchange for a divine gift of some sort.As you ponder this ritual, the glint of steel catches your eye from a nearby weapon rack....14358According to ancient legend, this ancient brazier was placed here for the performing of sacrifices.From what little you remember of the stories, a blessing is bestowed upon the being who places the flesh of Elune's enemies on the brazier's burning embers.Looking around, you determine that the satyrs who now possess this region would likely qualify.14359You feel a deep connection to the distant past having partaken of the ancient blessing granted by this relic.You determine to make as much as you can of this divine gift.14360The markings on the Sargeron ruins, combined with what you've gleaned from Furien's text make one thing clear:There is something special about the old fountain in the Sanctuary of Elune.It would seem that one could expect special power from washing their face in the fountain. First, of course, there would need to be something in the ancient fountain with which to wash.Pondering this problem, you spot a melonfruit at the base of a nearby tree....14361We are a forward post, charged with monitoring potential adversaries. Once the Alliance launches its Desolace campaign, our work here will ensure that there are no surprises.Recently, one of our scouts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at their stronghold to the west. Since then, we've been assaulted with threats and taunts from a Burning Blade wretch named Kohor.Their days here are numbered, but I will pay handsomely for that one to be silenced now!14362Captain Pentigast has made no secret of his disdain for the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress.Surely, proof of their demise would be of value to him.14363With his dying breath, Kohor mentioned the summoning of a demon that could threaten the entire region.He may have been bluffing, but that's not a chance worth taking.This cannot wait for the Alliance's invasion of Desolace to take shape. You must scour Thunder Axe Fortress for clues and bring an end to this potential threat.14364So it's true....The parchment you discovered in Thunder Axe Fortress details a powerful summoning ritual. One stronger than the Burning Blade have ever been known to possess.Clearly, this rite must be stopped at all costs!Perhaps if this demon were summoned forth prematurely the crisis could be averted.14365We have recently received a plea for help from a researcher of the Cenarion Circle.We have no one we can spare to send, so I ask that you pay her a visit on our behalf.Korrah is posted near the ruined tower of Ethel Rethor, on the coast to the west.14366We can take it from here, .  Check in with Mayor Armstead.These are only a small part of the Forsaken's forces.  If we don't move quickly we're going to have bigger problems on our hands.See what you can do to engage the Forsaken army at their landing location.14367Lord Godfrey is leading the attack near the Forsaken's landing area.  See what you can do to help us keep the Forsaken back.I've been told Godfrey has commandeered the storm cellar in the Allen Farmstead, far to the west.  Seek him there.14368The military will not allow me outside the cellar, but my children are still in my farm!  Please, you must go find them.The Forsaken have no regard for innocent life -- my kids are in great danger!Their names are Cynthia, Ashley and James.  If you find them, bring them back here.  I'll be forever in your debt.14369I'm not going to lie, .  I don't like the idea of having worgen among our ranks.Who knows how long 'til Krennan's concoction wears off and you're trying to chomp one of our heads off.Until that time, however, we can make ample use of your ferocity.I want you to go out in the battlefield and kill as many of those Forsaken as you can, in as brutal a way as you can.We're going to put the fear of the worgen in them, .14370Azsharite! This mysterious crystalline substance has been used to forge weapons of fel power, but in our hands, we've discovered that it's capable of focusing enormous amounts of energy. It may be the biggest goblin discovery since kaja'mite.But what is it? Where does it come from? Why is it located only here? Science demands an answer! I need more samples to study. Search out Azsharite deposits all along the nearby cliffs.14371While you're here running around the cliffs, perhaps you can help me with another line of investigation. The giants who walk these cliffs have been here since these mountains formed. Maybe they know where the Azsharite comes from? It's in our best interest to befriend these giants and find out.Gather up a gigantic meal for me as a peace offering! Kill the mistwing cliffdwellers that have been such a nuisance to our studies and collect their carcasses for me.14372It pleases me to see that you still draw breath, . I have been sent word that the demon activity in the south has been intensifying.There is a camp on the borderlands there that is in danger of being cut off if the demons move northward.Perhaps you could lend them a hand?I know the leader of the camp there is Thargad. He will be able to direct you wisely.Thank you, friend. Be well.14373Listen up, now. An' lookie here.Yeh see them big green glowin' balls that be fallin' from the sky?Those be a nasty buncha demons roamin' the lands unchecked. Well, almost unchecked... I've been keepin' 'em on their toes, givin' 'em sumthin' ta think about.How 'bout you get over there an' pick up where I left off?14374Here it is - the Hand of Iruxos.Got it from one o' them Burning Blade leaders myself.Powerful thing! See, yeh use it on demon portals and they just disappear! Spooky magic, but these be desperate times...The demons keep comin' at this rate, and my camp will get overrun before ya know it.Here ya go, now. Get on with it.1437514376You recognize this as the essence of a summoned demon.Dangerous and rarely understood energies weave in and out of its surface.As you gaze upon it, a vision fills your mind - an image of yourself controlling demonic minions. A rush of excitement flows through you as you imagine wielding such power.Looking at your surroundings, you wonder how this treasure might be used against this demonic enemy....14377A cursory study of the azsharite you brought me reveals that it's not biological in nature, nor is it naturally formed. There's another creature in Azshara with similar properties: the cliff giants that lumber around these cliffs.One of the giants seems willing to help our research along. Take the meat you collected to Gormungan, the giant standing just west of here. Befriend him, then grill him - find out if he knows the secret of azsharite!14378I'm too busy collectin' artifacts to busy myself with much else, but there is a bit of an issue here I wouldn't mind sortin' out.There's a forsaken apothecary who's been pokin' around these parts for a while now. Normally, I'd ignore him, but three times now he's snuck into my camp and pilfered my supplies.... enough's enough!Find the thief and bring me whatever's left o' my things!14379Thargad works practically nonstop chasing after ancient Titan relics. He stays so busy that if it weren't for me, he'd probably forget to eat!Speaking of eating, I'd like to prepare him something special - perhaps you could help me out?Lobstrock roam all over the coast to the west. I'd never last in a fight with them myself, but I could make a great meal if you were to bring me some of their tails!14380Well now, this is odd... it's a hollow kodo horn with some sort of potion inside.WHEW! Definitely not any kind of healthy elixir. This mess is meant for one thing... killin'.How 'bout yeh run it back up to Karnum and see if there's anything he can do with it...14381I recognize this foul creation. It's a terrible disease that kills almost instantly, and in a most violent manner. Loathe as I am to employ such devices, I fear we have no choice here.As you of course know, the naga remain a serious threat to the region. The time has come for us to drive them back into the sea!When you are ready, Grimfeather will take you to the crevasse where they are preparing a violent assault.Use the concoction on the naga and their allies to make Desolace safe!14382The Forsaken catapults are kicking the snot out of us, .  And even if we do take care of them, they've two ships with rows of cannons at the ready.I've a plan to kill two birds with one stone.

If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while.20439I've placed an enchantment on the tabard that should allow you to slip past the Sunreaver Sanctuary's defenses for a short period of time. You should have enough time to find your way into The Filthy Animal and meet up with the Sunreaver contact there, one Magister Hathorel.Obtain the copy of Ancient Dragonforged Blades that his men borrowed from Wyrmrest while your disguise holds, and return it to me.20440Our sacred wells have been tainted, and I will need your help to fix this.To cleanse each well, I must create a cleansing totem, then you must bring the totem to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.First we will create a cleansing totem for the Winterhoof Water Well.

The naga have been attacking here relentlessly.You're not equipped to be of much help down here yet, but I can remedy that.Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help to increase your chances of survival.24433Our grunts are strong but have no initiative.

Slay our foes in territory they think is secure, leaving blood and fear in your wake.24434Are you sensitive to the tremors of the local ley-lines, ? I can feel the occasional thrum, like the plucking of a string. It's the kind of resonance I'd expect from a long-range summoning spell. The Lorekeepers in Talrendis, with their laughably primitive magics, are trying to summon in backup from Darnassus.We can use this to our advantage, . If you can compromise their summoning stone, we can teleport a crack team of commandos behind enemy lines.Locate the summoning stone in Talrendis!24435There are a lot of naga left on this beach.

It was a direct hit!My scouts tell me that you gravely wounded Jarrodenus, flight master of the night-elven skychasers and de facto commander of the opposition.The opportunity to strike is now - I don't have time to assemble a full assault. Rush the command center building and kill Commander Jarrodenus before his backup arrives. Bring me his head... and Azshara is ours!24440I have crafted the totem to cleanse the Winterhoof Water Well.  Now, you must take it to the well and perform a cleansing ritual.

Be careful...but do not let the defilers of our well escape.24441There is more work to be done.  We must create a new totem to cleanse the Thunderhorn Well.You must gather the claws of the predators of the Mulgore plains.  Hunt prairie stalkers for their stalker claws and flatland cougars for their cougar claws, then return to me.You will find the prairie stalkers and flatland cougars to the east and west.24442Looking over the captured attack plans, you find a map of the Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor with major settlements marked. Reading over the orders, you learn that  Kvaldir captains have drafted plans for a series of devastating raids.According to the orders, the attacks are to begin after Mistcaller Yngvar \"consults the Heart of the Mists.\" Perhaps you could delay the attacks by capturing the omen from the Mistcaller's Cave on the western side of Hrothgar's Landing and notify Justicar Mariel Trueheart.24448Commander Molotov sent word directly that you should be dispatched to our forward post.

Gallywix will probably keep forking out cash to keep us posted here, but I have a feeling we might be able to milk a bit more out of the deal.Naga and Sea Giants aren't normally friends, so the naga must be controlling them somehow. Take this stealth field generator, get in those ruins, and let me know if you find something that looks really pricey.24453Look... one last favor before you run off.Private Worcester is still back at that tower \"recruiting.\" Go and let him know that we're good to pack it up now. Back to town.Pleasure working with you, recruit.24454We must get this book to Caladis Brightspear immediately. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at keeping the Sunreavers at bay.Take it with you to Quel'Delar's rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown.

My pilot-for-hire Friz Groundspin here can give you a ride.I'll follow... from a safe distance.24459You may have heard of the Venture Company. They are a goblin \"cartel\", something like a tribe.While one of these cartels has joined us in the Horde, the Venture Company is loyal only to greed. These greedy goblins and their workers have tried to exploit the resources of Mulgore before, to little success.One of our outrunners, Morin Cloudstalker, has gone to check the remains of one of the goblin caravans. If you wish to help him, follow the road out of the village to the east.24461We cannot allow Quel'Delar to remain broken and disgraced. Take the remnants of the sword, along with the battered hilt you discovered, and venture into the Pit of Saron within Icecrown Citadel.In the pit, the Lich King uses slaves to mine, process, and transform saronite ore. This infused saronite is what we will use to rebuild Quel'Delar.You must gather bars of infused saronite and capture the forgemaster's hammer, then bring them to the forgemaster's anvil and reforge the sword.24462Now that ye've killed those wolves, let's try out somethin' different.

The night elves may be making an assault on our territory in the Barrens., I need you to slip across the border and speak to one of my scouts. Look for Kulg Gorespatter just across the bridge at the southwest edge of Talrendis Point. Find out what's happening in those woods!24467Now we put an end to all this madness. We need to rout the black dragonflight from Azshara entirely before they can return with any communication for their master.I still don't know what they have up their sleeve for capturing us, so I'd like to ask this one last thing of you - go into sable ridge and kill their leaders, Twilight Lord Katrana and Malicion.If things get hairy, I will come help. I just don't want to risk falling into whatever trap they set for Azuregos.24468The ogres got two of our stagecoaches: this one and one that fell into the marsh just north of here.I want you to head there and rescue any survivors while we hatch up a plan to deal with these ogres.24469Hey, you there!  Ye're a stout-looking .  Lend us a hand?It looks like today's big earthquake shook a bunch o' those barbarous troggs out of the ground, and they're sure steamed about something.  My men are doing what they can to hold them off, but we could use a hand.Do yer part - head just south of here and help dig me mountaineers outta trouble.  We've got to hold the line!24470Alright, , listen up.  I know a thing or two about troggs, and one of those things is that the biggest, strongest troggs get the most respect.  The brutes value strength over anything else.Ye see those great big troggs sitting back behind the front lines?  They're the closest they have to what ye'd call a leader.  Go take out a few, and show 'em what it means to mess with the Sons of Ironforge!24471, listen!  Unlike Joren, I've no need for yer blade, but I do need someone with a steady hand and a bit o' courage.Our mountaineers are trained to protect the village from the odd wolf attack... not an all-out trogg invasion!  Many of our best have succumbed to wounds and exhaustion, and I need yer help bandaging them up.Here, take my first aid kit and assist as many as ye can.24472The Forsaken are right on our heels and now these ogres are trying to flank us, .They're servants of the ettin Koroth -- the meanest, most destructive force in all of Gilneas.If we can bait Koroth into charging the Forsaken's forward force, we should be able to cover our retreat and buy some time.The only way this can work is if we make Koroth furious.  It won't be enough to just kill his minions.  We need to swipe his most prized possession, a tiger-skinned banner.24473We appreciate yer help out here, but there may be a place where they need ye even more.Due to the trogg attacks - not to mention that massive earthquake we just had - we're putting all civilians on lockdown inside Anvilmar, just up the hill to the northwest.Go an' talk to me wife, Jona, inside Anvilmar.  I'm certain she's in need of an able-bodied  such as yerself.24474I don't know how ANYONE expects to get any work done around here if we don't have any ale!  Our beer level here in Anvilmar is dangerously low.Lucky for us, we've stowed some backup kegs for just such an occasion.  West of Anvilmar, along the valley's northern border, ye'll find kegs of Stormhammer Stout and Theramore Pale Ale.  Just to the east of here, ye'll find a stash of Gnomenbrau.  That's me personal favorite.24475If we're going to be on lockdown for any extended period o' time, we're gonna need some food, and some blankets to keep the wee ones warm.  Would ye mind headin' outside and gatherin' up some supplies?Ye'll find that a few o' the small boars actually have some healthy-sized haunches... good for eatin'.  We'll also need some pelts from the young wolves.Ye'll find animals almost anywhere ye go in Coldridge.24476At last, the pieces of Quel'Delar are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything.Deep in Icecrown Citadel's Forge of Souls is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me in The Frozen Halls.24477, my !  Are you into archaeology?We've an exciting opportunity right outside our front door.  All the shaking from today's seismic event has knocked a number of artifacts loose from the soil around our encampment.

Off you go!24478You know, some of my apprentices have called me cold hearted. I always say though, I shall not let the temperature of my body parts stand in the way of true learning.To reach the Trial of Frost, touch the Frost crystal to open a portal. Once there, the goal is quite simple - gather the little floaty ice orb thingies.To counter the simple, the rotating Frostburns may put back your progress, as it were. If you want to be fancy, you can use the rune traps to jump over them as they rotate by. Neat, eh?24479Let us not be confined by the bounds of the mage repertoire of magic. I, for one, choose not to be classist. Necromancy can just be so much fun!Touch the Shadow Crystal to open a portal to my Trial of Shadow.

And be sure not to let them touch you.24480You have reforged and tempered the sword, yet it sits quietly in its sheath, showing no signs of the power it should possess. You say the sword pulls you, as though it possesses a will?Dare you bring it where it wishes to go? It's not right that the sword should be this silent and this insistent, yet I fear that if you do not take the sword to its destination, we will never learn why. Take it into Icecrown Citadel's Halls of Reflection, but be on your guard! I'll be waiting for you in The Frozen Halls.24483Our carriage drivers were told to regroup in the fishing town of Stormglen.  Our scouts report there might be shelter and supplies to be found there.Meet Gwen Armstead there, she'll be in charge of taking care of our people.24484Well, what do you know, ?  All this time and Stormglen's been left mostly intact.It's too bad the Forsaken are still working their way inland, but it'll make a fine place to rest our feet for a night or two.The other half of town is overrun with spiders, so I've asked the villagers to stay away from there.Perhaps you'd like to lend a hand in clearing the spiders out?  I'm certain our injured men and women will sleep more soundly if they know someone's keeping those eight-legged beasts at bay.24486The trogg village to the southwest suffered similar damage to ours.  One would assume, logically, that there would be some trogg artifacts sticking out of the ground, too!Unfortunately, it looks like most of the artifacts have already been scooped up by trogg scavengers.  Please, go see if you can find some way to get them back.  Believe it or not, knowledge about troggs may eventually lead to further knowledge about the mighty dwarves!24487Ye've done us a great service here, but I'm afraid I've gotta send ye off elsewhere.Grelin Whitebeard, a good friend of mine, has put in word that he may need some reinforcements near the troll camps to the southwest.

Any green-blooded Kezanian will gladly let you have them if there's a chance that the Buccaneers will win.We'll show those no-good Steamwheedle Sharks how to play footbomb!24489I'm notoriously bad at reading troll facial expressions.  That being said, these trolls don't look angry to me.  They seem to be confused... maybe a little frightened.Something happened that we're not seeing here, .  I say we do some investigation before we just kill every troll in sight.There are three troll camps in the area: one to the southeast, one to the southwest, and one due west.  Each camp has a soothsayer... see if you can get close enough to listen to what they're saying.24490The presence of a fire elemental here in Coldridge is no small matter.  That earthquake did more than just upset a bunch of troggs... it changed the world enough to tear a gash into the elemental plane.  We should submit a report to Ironforge.You wouldn't be willing to take a trip, would ya?  Don't worry, I've a feeling that you'll do just fine.  Talk to Hands Springsprocket by the tunnel on the eastern edge of the valley.  He'll point you in the right direction.24491D-d-did you see that?  How the whole cave just crumbled like that?  I guess it's good that you got here when you did, and not a minute earlier.While this development makes my job of monitoring the cave entrance much easier, I imagine it makes it a lot harder for you to get to Kharanos.Hey wait, I've got an idea!  The Gnomeregan Airmen have a flight path not far from here.  I'll send up a signal, and they should be here to help.  I imagine they'll land back over at Anvilmar.24492The weight limit on my gyro is such that I only have enough room for one .  Looks like you're in luck, !That dwarf woman Jona told me that most of your personal belongings have been moved inside Anvilmar.

It'll be dangerous, but we're all counting on you.24502We're down to our last shredder.

You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right. I don't want you to just kick a goal...

I see you've discovered the high road.The Alliance hopes to sever our ties with Stonetalon, but they forget that we tauren have hunted across these lands for generations.

The prison tower below us is lightly guarded. Let's give those prisoners one final chance to die with honor.I've set up ropes that will allow you to quickly clamber up and down the mountain. Slip down, acquire the confiscated weapons, and re-arm the prisoners inside the tower.And , stay by the tower! We're not yet equipped for an assault on the base proper.24513Who goes there? Your footsteps are not the lazy stride of a guard.A , you say? Still brave and free? There's no hope for me, friend. I have lost my eyesight and am no longer fit for battle.I dared speak up while Captain Peake savagely beat one of the prisoners. In return he kicked me in the head. And kept kicking.

But we make do with what's at hand, as we tauren always have.In the absence of a forge, a skilled leatherworker can strengthen and patch up our damaged armor with good quality hides.Down below is the hunting ground of the Terrortooth Raptors. They are not so easy to kill, in part due to the ruggedness of their thick skin. Hunt them, , and bring their hides to me!24515Turn your eyes to the southeast. Do you see the campfire smoke from Camp Una'fe?Not ten minutes ago I saw great puffs of white smoke roll up into the sky from the center of camp. It was an old signal used by my village to coordinate the hunt over great distances, but this time, it was a distress signal., my brother Makaba had gone into that unnatural jungle. Please go there and make sure he's not in any trouble.There are few paths: look for tents within the wilderness.24517Do you see the trail below us, ? That is MY trail. And if the Alliance dogs choose to use my trail, they'd best be looking over their shoulder.It's time to collect my toll! Slay the footsoldiers from Honor's Stand and see if we can't send them scurrying back to their walls.Be sure to take out at least one of their officers patrolling the road. They need to realize that nobody is safe.24518This bundle of papers was found in a leather satchel hidden under the officer's clothes.Battle maps of the region depict Honor's Stand, connected to what appears to be a large unfinished roadway crossing the Barrens all the way from Theramore. It looks like the Alliance plans to build a road from the coast straight into the heart of Kalimdor!Kilrok Gorehammer will want to see this.24519These maps have all been drawn by the same steady hand. I've seen a human surveyor heading up and down the road between the hold and the jungle to the east.We can set their plans back by making an example out of this surveyor, .What do you think that says? \"Zykes?\" Even human names sound thin and weak. Kill him.24520I'd celebrate with you, , but it feels like that dragon did a number on ol' Mount Kajaro. I... uh... I think I'm gonna grab my stuff and get on the first ship leaving the island!Anyways, you should probably head back to headquarters and let Sassy know that you won the footbomb title for us. I'm sure she'll also want to know about the dragon and Mount Kajaro.Good luck!24522Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, . Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword.The guardians of the Sunwell will not simply allow you to walk in, so you must find Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there.24523There is but one water well left to cleanse, named after the Wildmane clan.  For this well to be pure, the land must offer the teeth of a fierce predator, the prairie wolf alpha.  Find the alphas to the north, then return to me when your hunt is finished.Alphas often wander around the base of our mighty city, Thunder Bluff.24524Your cleansing of the Winterhoof and Thunderhorn wells is spoken among the spirits, young .  The Wildmane Totem is made, and your last task lies ahead.The Wildmane Water Well lies north of Thunder Bluff.  Perform the ritual!  Heal the land of the Grimtotem's poisons!  Let clean water flow once again!24525Not everyone who fled Taurajo was able to make it to Una'fe, . Some died of wounds along the way. Others were jumped by opportunistic quilboar.I'll take care of the grim task of finding and gathering the bodies. But there is something you can do for me.Hecklefang scavengers prowl the lands south of here and are savaging the corpses, tearing at their bowels and dragging away the limbs of the dead. Please, thin their numbers so that I can perform the proper funerary rites.24526Excellent!  Let's get started.As you grow in power, your connection to the arcane arts will deepen, and you'll gain access to new spells and abilities.Go, get some more experience, and you'll see what I mean. Come back when you learn something new and demonstrate it on the training dummies here.24527Excellent!  Let us begin.As you grow along your journey, you will unlocked the ancient secrets of shamans. Primal Strike is the first such skill.  The primal spirits, when called upon, will strengthen your arm to deliver a mighty blow.Helpful, isn't it?24528Are ye ready to start?  Wonderful!  We're glad to have ye.As ye get stronger, it brings ye closer to the light, and ye learn new techniques. Go ahead and get some more experience, and show me what ye learn.24529When the refugees fled north from Taurajo, some were separated as darkness closed in. Many were taken prisoner by the Bristleback quilboar who set up camp west and southwest of here.I am not certain what the quilboar hoped to get from us by capturing our refugees; all they have earned is my ire. And all they'll get in return is vengeance.Rescue my trapped brothers and sisters, and kill their captors to send a message to the quilboar.24530The life of a hunter is steeped in tradition, ye know.  Trackin' mighty beasts through rugged terrain.  Drinkin'.  Travelin' the land, yer gun at yer side.  Drinkin'.  Survivin' on wits and courage and cunning, followed by a good stiff drink.But before we get to the good stuff, though, ye'll need to learn how to do the beginner stuff.Go and get some more experience, and ye'll figure out how to do more things. Then ye' drink.24531Lesson one.  Aside from your sword and shield, what's the most important tool you have in your arsenal?Oh never mind, I'll answer it for you.  It's experience.As you get more experience, you'll discover new techniques, which means you can be much more effective than you imagined.Go, get some experience, and learn something new. Then come back and demonstrate.24532When you get to be more experienced, you'll start to find you can take advantage of new abilities. One of the things that you'll learn is the ability to use combat maneuvers to weaken an opponent, and then hit them with a devastating technique.Go and get some experience, figure out how to do it, and then try it out on some of the dummies here.24533Now, if ya DO want to become somethin' special, ye'll need to talk to me.  A priest is nothin' without his spells.  And how do you learn new spells?Ya go and get more experience. So go out, get stronger, and then come show me what ya learn.24534The quilboar are attacking because they perceive weakness. Strength is the only language they understand. So we will show them strength.This is admittedly crude work but it'll do. Bristleback leaders use horns like these to challenge one another for dominance., I want you to challenge the Bristleback champion, Sabersnout, to single combat. Defeat him in front of his followers. Blow the horn at the Bristleback challenge ring due south of here.24535If you truly bear Quel'Delar, , I might be able to admit you to the Sunwell. If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell.24536Get a load of these guys, would ya? Steamwheedle's been handling the business of holidays for years, and all of a sudden, these guys bust into the market. They're not Steamwheedle; the cartel hired me to get to the bottom of this. Something stinks here and it ain't just perfume.Take this device I brought and go analyze the perfume clouds around the guards. I want to know what they're putting in that stuff. Things ain't natural.24539This camp was built at the edge of this jungle, and already it is overwhelmed by plant growth. Something unnatural is happening here!Earlier I made the mistake of sending some of the healthier refugees out to gather nuts and berries. Those that returned talked about the plant life actually grasping at their legs or even picking them up. I worry about those that haven't come back yet., please rescue the refugees trapped in the grasping overgrowth around the camp.24540Some see our people as gentle giants, or noble savages. They have never seen us fight against our own kind...against betrayers from within.The Grimtotem were offered mercy in exile, and they have scarred their own home to spite us. They will no longer be tolerated in Mulgore.I've already sent our warriors ahead to drive them out through Stonetalon Pass, to the north. You have fought bravely against the Grimtotem, ; I ask that you join the battle again. Go, and help deal this final blow.24541I knew they were up to no good! There's some sort of mind-affecting chemical in here, but I can't get a handle on it with such a small sample. I need the real stuff.Don't just go over there and buy it! I don't want you giving these scumbags one copper. Nah, you gotta get it from the source, discreet-like.I'll disguise you as a package runner. I saw a stockpile guarded by their goons outside the gates. Go run by, and DON'T stop, or they'll make you! They'll toss you a crate. Bring it back here.24542The great archdruid Naralex recently appeared here in the Barrens. He's either behind this mess or trying to fix it. Either way, you should talk with him before this jungle engulfs the whole world! He's in a small tauren camp to the southeast.Along the way, it would be helpful for you to gather plant samples for him to study. The newest flower buds will tell him a great deal about the most recent changes in the jungle.24543The children you see here were all rescued from Taurajo when the fighting started. I'm trying to track down their parents.One of the refugees you rescued from the quilboar recognized the strongest child as belonging to Kirge and Mawre Sternhorn. Moreover, he said Kirge was camped at the Fields of Blood, just north of the Taurajo massacre site., please go there and tell Kirge Sternhorn that his child is alive and well!24545It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, , as it will likely end in your undoing.Ignore my counsel and embark on the endeavor, and I shall provide you with the knowledge and resources to see it through.You must return to Frostmourne Cavern and recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Reforged with saronite and etched with the acidic blood of the Lich King's abominations, it will provide the foundation for our work.24546The Alliance scorches a trail of murder across the Barrens. We must stop them here or there is nothing left for us.Across the Fields of Blood there are a number of strategic hills, marked by wooden towers and neutral gray banners. We must take and hold these hills if we hope to slow the Alliance advance!Look for the towers to the north, east, and south of what's left of Taurajo. Claim a neutral flag and defend the hill against counterattack!24547Shadow's Edge is among the greatest weapons a  could hope to obtain.Is your lust for power sated, ?I thought not. A final warning then...You now embark on the most treacherous leg of your quest. Bridle your aspirations, for if your aims are impure then your life, your very soul, is forfeit.The weapon you hold is but an empty husk, a mere shadow of what it may become.24548The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether, its sole purpose to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit.When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King's most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade.2454924550The wells are cleansed, and Mulgore's waters run sweet and clear once more. You've saved us...but you've also uncovered grim happenings. The actions of the Grimtotem must be made known.It is time for you to enter Thunder Bluff, our great city atop the mesa.  Go to our leader, Baine Bloodhoof, son of Cairne. He must hear of this.24551Our defense of the Barrens hasn't gone well under Gar'dul's command, . Garrosh has sent Warlord Bloodhilt here to take control of the situation. He's here in camp, and if you want to make a good impression, you'll demonstrate some initiative.Head east into the Fields of Blood and seek out Northwatch recon units. Bringing the new Warlord a stack of their merit badges will help you make a name for yourself!24552If you seek vengeance on our Alliance invaders, you would do well to observe the fiercest of predators in the Barrens.The lions that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power. Learn from their example and you will understand the kind of war we need to fight.Hunt the plains prowlers and pridemanes, then return to me to discuss what you have learned. You will often find them in the shade of large trees.24553I admit, I was skeptical that you had actually re-forged Quel'Delar and I did not expect Thalorien's spirit to reveal itself to you. You cannot understand what it means to me and to the rest of my people that Quel'Delar has been recovered.As promised, I will admit you to the Sunwell and you will find the leaders of Silvermoon within. Carry the sword to the chamber of the Sunwell and immerse it. The blade will bond to you. When that happens, carry it to Caladis Brightspear at Quel'Delar's Rest.24554This battered old sword hilt has seen better days. Before the hilt was snapped from the blade, it must've been a magnificent example of the blacksmith's art.The graceful symbols and exotic gemstones decorating the hilt suggest that the weapon may have belonged to a powerful person. Surely, the Sunreavers would be interested in hearing about the recovery of such an artifact. Seek out their representatives at Quel'Delar's Rest, to the south of the Argent Tournament Grounds.24555There's no mistaking it - this hilt comes from a powerful, ancient weapon, but which one? I do not recognize these particular markings, but we haven't hit a dead end yet.Korialstrasz, better known as Krasus, has long been a friend to the quel'dorei and the Kirin Tor. With his vast knowledge and resources, he's certain to know something. Travel to the top of Wyrmrest Temple and seek his counsel, then report to Magister Hathorel inside Sunreaver's Sanctuary in Dalaran.24556Getting you inside the Silver Enclave will be tougher than it appears. Only those who possess Silver Covenant tabards are permitted entry to sanctuary. If we can get our hands on one, a simple enchantment will do the rest of the work.On the balcony above Threads of Fate, you'll find Shandy Glossgleam. I've helped him a few times in the past, so he owes me a favor. He handles laundry for a wide variety of people in the city. Maybe he can find a way to 'lend' you a tabard for a while.24557One of my contacts in the Underbelly caught sight of a Silver Covenant agent gathering information at the Cantrips and Crows Tavern. Silver Covenant members aren't normally found in the sewers, so they must be plotting something.Go into the Underbelly, find this Silver Covenant agent, and eliminate him. Search the body for any information that might give us a lead on the location of that tome from Wyrmrest. We can't let those simpering Silver Covenant weaklings get it back to Icecrown before we do.24558We must get this book to Myralion Sunblade. Would you bring it to him? I cannot rely on anyone else to transport the book and you have proven adept at evading the Silver Covenant's men.Take it with you to Quel'Delar's Rest, south of the Argent Tournament Grounds in Icecrown. Myralion will be waiting for you. If he can identify that blade, we may be able to claim it in the name of Aethas Sunreaver and show Dalaran and the Alliance that we will lead the charge against the Lich King.24559We cannot allow Quel'Delar to remain broken and disgraced. Take the remnants of the sword, along with the battered hilt you discovered, and venture into the Pit of Saron within Icecrown Citadel.In the pit, the Lich King uses slaves to mine, process, and transform saronite ore. This infused saronite is what we will use to rebuild Quel'Delar.You must gather bars of infused saronite and capture the forgemaster's hammer, then bring them to the forgemaster's anvil and reforge the sword.24560At last, the pieces of Quel'Delar are rejoined and the blade is whole, but it cannot see battle until you have tempered it. That jagged saronite edge is brittle and will shatter the moment it strikes anything.Deep in Icecrown Citadel's Forge of Souls is a place where the blade can safely be tempered. Take Quel'Delar with you to the abode of the Devourer of Souls and look for the crucible. Plunge the blade into the crucible to temper it and bring it back to me. I'll be waiting in The Frozen Halls.24561You have re-forged and tempered the sword, yet it sits quietly in its sheath, little different from a mundane blade. You say the sword pulls you, as though it possesses a will?Dare you bring it where it wishes to go? It is not right that the sword should be this silent and this insistent, yet I fear that if you do not take the sword to its destination, we will never learn why. Bear it with you to Icecrown Citadel's Halls of Reflection, but be on your guard. I will wait for you in The Frozen Halls.24562Take Quel'Delar to the Sunwell as quickly as possible, . Trust in Uther's words when he says that you will not always be able to control the blade while it is subject to the evil of the Lich King's influence. You must travel to the Isle of Quel'Danas, and there, seek entry to the Sunwell itself, where you can cleanse the sword.The guardians will try to stop you from entering the Sunwell Plateau, but make yourself known to Halduron Brightwing, who will be inspecting the guards there.24563You are the one working with Myralion Sunblaze, arent you? I know of a way we can test the sword.If you know the blade's history, you recall that it was borne by Thalorien Dawnseeker in defense of the Sunwell against the Scourge. He fell in what is now the Dead Scar, buying time for his men to make their own preparations. You will find his remains near the southern end of the Dead Scar on this isle. Visit them, and if his spirit gives you its blessing, I will allow you to enter the Sunwell.24564The Sunwell and the end of Quel'Delar's exile await, .You will find Lor'themar Theron, the regent of Quel'Thalas, and Grand Magister Rommath standing within. Be wary and do not allow them to entrap you in their political scheming.Instead, remain focused on your task here. Speak to a Warden of the Sunwell when you are ready to enter the Sunwell. Immerse the reformed Quel'Delar in the Sunwell to complete the restoration. Afterward, show the blade to Myralion Sunblaze at Quel'Delar's Rest.24565The energies unleashed here have surged through the wildlife, twisting them into powerful and unstable forms. If allowed to spread beyond this grove, these deviates will wreak havoc on the existing ecosystem, devouring local prey and driving out the weaker natural creatures.You must go and cull the population of the overgrowth. Return when this task is done.24566Based on what you've brought me, I think we may have a solution. I've imbued the lashvine seeds with healing energies.Simple contact with these should imbue the creatures here with enough energy to force out the corrupted influence.Go and attempt to heal the mutated raptors and plainstriders by sprinkling the seeds on them, and report the results back to me.24567, Coach Crosscheck is looking for you. He's the leader of our fearless footbomb team, the Bilgewater Buccaneers.He says that the division title against the Steamwheedle Sharks is on the line and that you're the only one that can bring it home for us!Head west into town. You can't miss Kajaro Field.A footbomb star. This is going to be great for your image!24568, they're massing at the gates! The Alliance is trying to push their way into Mulgore, using footsoldiers to overwhelm the guards.We have so little with which to defend the walls. We've kept pots of water boiling to repel the attackers until help arrives... Those will have to do.But we need someone to coordinate our defenses. Say the word and I can give you an eagle-eye view of the battlefield.We need you, !24569, you've proven yourself on the Fields of Blood. But the Alliance still threatens our tauren friends.The siege machinery outside the gates of Mulgore is like a spear aimed at our heart. I want you to go to the gates, south of here, and remove those siege vehicles from play.Here, use these stickybombs. They're courtesy of our new goblin allies. It looks as though they stuffed explosive powder into ... what looks like ... grease-covered socks. But they'll do.24570The corruption unleashed here must be studied if we're to find a way of properly fighting it.Luckily, not all the creatures have been as altered as others. The smaller snakes drink little water, and do not eat plants, so their exposure to the energies here has been minimal. They've still absorbed enough to change coloration.Go collect these snakes from the overgrowth and return them to me, so we can see just what is happening to the creatures here.24571There's got to be a way to cure these poor creatures without having to take their lives. I have an idea, but I'll need your help, .The lashvine plants that roam here hold seeds full of the primal energy of this place. Collect these for me and bring them back, and we'll see if something can be done.24572Outstanding work at the gates, ! The main body of the Alliance force is in general retreat. But I'm not satisfied.They sacked Taurajo, which was little more than a hunters' camp. This 'Alliance' is unmasked at last for what it really is: A renegade band of butchers.Even now a group of humans linger behind to pick at the bones of smouldering Taurajo.Make them suffer.24573With the immediate threat gone, can you help with some grim business?We tauren do not bury our dead, we prepare the body for its return to the elements and place it at our sacred grave sites. Those killed in the Taurajo massacre have had no funeral, and I worry misguided Alliance soldiers will burn the bodies of the dead before the proper rites have been performed., please take this totem to Taurajo and perform services for Krulmoo, Dranh, Yonada, and Omusa. They ... didn't make it out of there.24574If I have truly sown chaos, it is time for reaping.The lumbering outgrowths of plant life shamble through the imbued stream here, . They are a direct manifestation of the unstable forces mutating this area. Slay as many as you can, and we might be able to slow the spread of the overgrowth further.And while you're at it...be on the lookout for parts of them that appear especially corrupted. Bring any such pieces to me.24575We recently found out that the villagers at Emberstone survived most of the ravages of the Curse.Unfortunately their village wasn't as fortunate when it came to the Forsaken invasion.The Forsaken have taken the villagers prisoner and are forcing them to work the nearby mine as slaves.24576You mean I've been under the spell of an alchemist all this time? I can't believe I fell for that fraud! If I ever get my hands on that conniving little goblin, I'll tear him apart!If he's finished his errands, he's on his way down to the zeppelin tower in the middle of Orgrimmar! Whatever you do, , you can't let him board that zeppelin and get away with all this!Hurry to the zeppelin tower before you miss him!24577Thanks to you, the immediate threat is over. But my work here in the Barrens is only beginning.Honor's Stand was captured and Taurajo was sacked while Warlord Gar'dul was in charge of the region. The Warchief has sent me here to clean up his mess.I would like you to ride into Desolation Hold to the south in advance of me and let Gar'dul know that it is time for a reckoning.Talk to me when you are ready to leave and I will assemble my vanguard to accompany you.24578It took a while, but I think I've put together what happened here.  At least partially.There were survivors of the Curse in this town.  They joined others in the mountains, in Tempest's Reach.Everyone left, except the man who kept the journal, old man Bradshaw.  He noticed that the worgen attacks had stopped all of a sudden and decided to venture into the Blackwald.There is an abandoned mill just northeast of town, it was where Bradshaw lived.  See if you can find any clues there.24579Sartharion, the Onyx Guardian, watches over the eggs of the Twilight Dragonflight.

I cannot kill them fast enough with my own two hands.  Go and slay more for me, .24604I would ask a favor of you, .A warrior named Mankrik passed through our camp not long ago, on a lonely journey. His wife was killed by the quilboar, long ago, and he still seeks revenge. I cannot forget his eyes...burning with inconsolable hatred, every waking moment.We did not talk long, but I cannot bear to think of him out there alone. Please, bring this to Mankrik, and tell him it is from me...24606This bright red stone, found clutched in the grasp of a quilboar, has been carefully carved into the likeness of a great boar, with thorny vines sprouting from its back. Its surface is smooth and worn with care.Did the quilboar make this? If you find others, maybe one of the shaman at Firestone Point could tell you more about them.24607Tha Darkspear tribe have long been victims. Outcasts. We found ourselves fleein' our homes time 'n time again... but dis time, it's not fleein' dat drives us here.Vol'jin has offered us leadership through wisdom, and it has kept us alive dis long.

It is also there that you will find someone who can offer guidance.  An old friend.24618We have fought the Alliance to a standstill here, even as the land beneath our feet falls apart. To the east you will find the Battlescar, a wide swath of decimated terrain. It is little more than a line in the sand, but it must be OUR line.In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls it. Scout out the flag.If it's not already ours, capture it for the Horde - it will swing the battle in our favor.

There's no substitute for doing!First, I'm going to need parts. Lots of parts. And you're going to get them for me.No need to be picky: human, orc... it doesn't matter. Parts is parts.Just be sure the corpses you harvest come from the Battlescar, so I know they're fresh.24620These parts - so lovely! Muscle and sinew and fingers and toes ... I am SO hungry right now.But work must come first. Once I stitch this pile of parts together I'm going to need a heart strong enough to pump sludge through this rat's nest of veins. I would use my own heart, but it's a shriveled up husk resembling a turnip.No, I need some real power. Get me a kodo heart from one of those giant landquaker bulls to the south of the Battlescar.24621My monstrosity is taking shape! All that's left is to stuff his skull with something useful.I'm talking about brains, . And here I'm going to be picky. The abomification process causes significant brain damage so it's best to start with someone smart.One of the Alliance officers should do nicely. Seek out one of the Captains on the far side of the Battlescar and try not to damage the goods while you kill him.24622If ya lookin' for something ta do, we need some more raptors moved over to da pens.

They've taught us who we are and where we come from.Thanks to them... thanks to this place... we're no longer mere beasts.  We have regained free will.The Forsaken aren't here for our land alone.They're looking for something we possess.  An artifact capable of uncontrollably spreading the Curse to all humanity.

Go to Mankrik, and tell him to come see me.24634I am convinced the Alliance is using spies to scout the field and pass along information. They knew to strike at Taurajo while the hunters were afield. And they countered every one of Gar'dul's moves like he was an open book.Well , I for one will not be outplayed. Not here.

A goblin saboteur: Weezil Slipshadow.

If we can just find the ammunition magazine, we could blow this place sky-high as easy as kiss-my-hand!But to figure it out I'm going to need the fortress schematics, and I haven't been able to steal them yet.Look for the plans on the lowest floor, right down these stairs.24686The Bloodpetals of Un'Goro have a fascinating life cycle.These trees in front of us bear seeds that fall down into the river when they mature.  The river's current then takes the seed north of here, where the seed hatches - almost like an egg - and a newborn Bloodpetal emerges.I require these seeds for my studies.  Take this net, and use it to scoop up the bright orange seeds in the river.  You'll have to hunt them down under the water.24687You're already familiar with the first phase of the Bloodpetals' life cycle: the waterborne seed.  The next phase, however, is not so docile: the pack of juveniles.When Bloodpetals hatch, they quickly form gangs and travel together, offsetting their weakness with overwhelming numbers.  These packs of young lashers normally keep to themselves, but upset one of them and you upset them all.For our safety and the safety of others, dispose of them.  They roam close by, to the west and north.24688You've already met one of my new students, the young worgen named Garl.  My other student is a troll by the name of Zen'Aliri.  He currently camps with the explorers of Marshal's Expedition, to the west of here.Take these results to him, , and tell him to read them well.24689Ithis Moonwarden is the night elf druid who indoctrinated me into the Cenarion Circle.  He has set up camp north of here, near the cliffs of the crater's easternmost edge.  Follow the flow of the Bloodpetal seeds, and I'll wager you'll find him nearby.My studies are limited only to seeds and other reagents, but he pursues more advanced matters.  If you are curious to learn more about Un'Goro's flora, you should speak with him now.24690I'm still a bit concerned about these fire elementals, .  One last request: head to the top of Fire Plume Ridge, and kill the one they call Blazerunner.  He's the biggest and strongest of all the fire elementals in the crater.  With him gone, I'll be able to sleep much better.24691Hey , interested in making an extra dime?I've got it on good authority that some interested parties are paying BIG money for silithid legs.  Yes, you heard me right, silithid legs!  Apparently these things are delicious if you cook them right.  They're like underground lobsters, and they live just south of here.Thing is, I'll need a good amount of them to pay for my overhead.  Think you could get me 8 dozen or so?24692If you're here to help, then maybe you can help us with a lurking threat.To the south lies the Slithering Scar, a quivering silithid outpost in the middle of the jungle.  You can't miss it.One of my scouts reports that the silithid are harboring a young colossus in their large central underground chamber, and once it is fully grown, they plan to unleash it upon Un'Goro!This must not be allowed to pass, .  Find the colossus and kill it.24693Here in Marshal's Stand, I can't really do too much profiteering without arousing suspicion from the scientists.  There is, however, another place where I might have use of you.My business associate, Gremix, has a camp northwest of here, on the opposite side of the volcano.  He's a savvy business mind, and has a better eye for profit than even I do.  I'm sure he could put you to work, if you'd like to make some more coin.24694The crystal pylons have been activated.  A sufficient number of crystals have been gathered.  The prerequisites have been met.  We are prepared for teleport to The Shaper's Terrace.Speak to me when you are ready, .  We will consult with The Watcher.24695When my master Khaz'Goroth shaped the world you call Azeroth, he designed Un'Goro Crater to be an area for experimentation.  You might call it the Titans' petri dish.If you seek further knowledge about the methods in which we observe the world, pull the four levers behind me and complete my tests.24697I don't believe we've met... I'm Nolen Tacker, Marshal Expeditions' new chief of the guards.  I'm also their chef.  There's actually more overlap than you'd think.I've got a fun little task for you.  Have you seen the spike pits around the perimeter of the camp?  See if you can convince some of the nearby dinosaurs to walk into them.  If you throw this rotten meat at them when they're not looking, it'll either make them hungry or angry.  Either way is fine, as long as they follow you into the pit!24698Hey, you want to try my new diemetradon dogs?  No?  Raptor risotto?  Pterrordax ptacos?Fine.  Oh, I just remembered!  I have a friend nearby that might be able to use your assistance.  His name is Spark Nilminer, and he's Marshal Expeditions' chief archaeology officer.He's been sent out to Golakka Hot Springs, to the west.  You'll likely find him on the springs' western shore.24699Hey, I know!  We've been looking at the wrong tar creatures.Gremix once told me about a larger-than-normal tar creature that he ran into.  It lurks around the tar pit far to the east of here, south of Fungal Rock.  I'll bet that the bigger these creatures get, the stickier they get!  We'll make some money yet, !Don't forget the scraper!24700The Lakkari Tar Pits, just north of here, conceal a hidden treasure: rare flowers that grow at the bottom of the pits.  These tarblossoms, as they're called, are valued for their beauty and their durability.  It's been a while since I last harvested tarblossoms, so there should be some new plants growing at the bottom of the pits.  Grab some for me?By the way, good luck swimming in tar.  It's nothing like swimming in water.24701A big part of making money is shamelessness.  You have to be willing to profit off of the misfortune of others.  It all ends up boiling down to one question: How much do you love money?When Marshal and his crew abandoned their refuge up to the north, they left behind lots of supplies.  This stuff isn't rare, or even particularly valuable, but it's there if you're willing to take it.  His camp is up in the cliffs, to the north.Oh, and be on the lookout for whatever it was that made them leave...2470224703What ho, traveler!  You must know that you set foot upon the camp of Maximillian of Northshire!  Mayhap you have heard tales sung of my many exploits?  I can see from the look in your eye that you have.  That glint of recognition plays upon your visage like the White Lady's reflection o'er Stonecairne Lake.It is clear to me that you seek adventure.  As you seem able enough, and thoroughly well-intentioned, I would offer to make you my squire.24704This crater is filled with a malignant breed of dragon.  Have you seen them?  They wander all about, parading their spiky backs and lizardy faces all around the Crater.Don't let them fool you, squire, for these dragons are no minions of graceful Alexstrasza.  They are clearly vicious, and direly in need of a hero's blade.I have decided that I will slay no less than 15 of them.  As my squire, you must come along.  Should we become separated, you may meet me back here at the Hot Springs.24705I've a feeling that we may find more than dragons here in this crater.  My paladin's instinct tells me that there are maidens nearby that require our aid.  While my heart beats only for my lady Doloria, a damsel in distress cannot be ignored.Let us sally forth, Squire !  The ladies of Un'Goro require our aid!24706A moment of seriousness now, .  We have an important quest ahead of us.  The treacherous dragons that plague this valley will not cease their mischief until we destroy their repugnant brood mother.  Before we even attempt to complete such a task, we must ask the Light for aid.I have seen the Light manifest itself nearby, in the form of Spirits floating by the shores of Golakka Hot Springs.  Come, I must speak with them, and ask them for aid.24707The time we have waited for is upon us, Squire .  Un'Goro's brood mother will perish at my hands.  The gravity of our task weighs heavily on me, but with the power of the Light behind us, we are guaranteed to succeed.Are you ready to depart?24708One of the things I hate the most about digging is the fact that half the time, all you find is dirt.  That's why I've been spending most of my time out here tinkering instead of digging.Let me show you what I've invented: the Fossil-Finder 3000.  I just put the finishing touches on it.  If it works properly, it should find the largest fossils in the area.  I know, sweet, huh?Test it out and see if you can find some ridiculously big dinosaur bones.24709Hey wait a minute, this bone has pickax marks on it.  These aren't yours, are they?  No, I recognize this mark... this must be that blasted dwarf!  Gah!Let me step back for a minute and explain.  There's another archaeologist south of here named Durrin Direshovel.  He practices a reckless, devil-may-care brand of archaeology that offends even me.A priceless fossil, ruined by sloppy pick-work.  This is the last straw, Durrin!, go put an end to Direshovel and his negligent excavation.24710We need to make our way up the main path and through the cave to Tyrannus' rise.He will be forced to confront us there lest we make our way into the citadel proper.Go now, . My men and I will be there to stand by you when the confrontation with Tyrannus comes.24711We must press on, hero. We've come so far... we're so close to our goal.I must delay a moment to send Elandra back to the airship. I'm uncertain how we're going to escape with so many men lost and so few to keep our path in secure.Continue on. I will meet you in the Halls of Reflection.24712We need to make our way up the main path and through the cave to Tyrannus' rise.There, he will be forced to confront us there lest we make our way into the citadel proper.Go now, . My men and I will be there to stand by you when the confrontation with Tyrannus comes.24713Keep moving, the sword is close.I need a moment to send one of my dark rangers back to the airship. With all of our fodder gone, I will not be caught unprepared - we will need any help they can send.Go. I will meet you in the Halls of Reflection.24714Unfortunately, something's happened to one of my greatest inventions.  You've seen mechanical squirrels, yes?  Well, to get closer to the apes of Un'Goro Crater, I created a mechanical ape to blend in with their kind--I call her A-Me 01.She has been studying the local wildlife at Fungal Rock for several months, but she should have returned by now.  I fear the worst for her.Can you help me find her?24715\"...operational capacity... less than 5%... accidentally... punctured oil reservoir...\"\"...use coconut milk... rock... save A-Me 01...\"24717There's plenty of money to be had here in Un'Goro, you just need to know where to look!Apes may be common here in Un'Goro, but they're much rarer up north.  In Everlook, a gorilla hide fetches ten times what you'll get for it down here!I'm not going to send you all the way up to Winterspring - that'd be irresponsible - but I could use your help actually obtaining some hides.You'll find gorillas at Fungal Rock, to the northeast, near a waterfall.  Don't forget to check inside the cave!24718Looking around, you see bits of red fur laying around this part of the cave.  It appears to match the consistency of gorilla fur.Based on your conversations with Gremix, you know that he would almost certainly be interested in a red gorilla hide, if you were to obtain one.24719Stop, .  I could use the help of a  like you.Right outside this camp, there are raptors with deadly claws.  I've been using the claws for druid rituals, but it doesn't seem to be working.  However, I did notice that some of those raptors sometimes have white claws, when most have deathly black ones.The earth works in strange ways.  Maybe you could fetch me some of the white claws, and I'll try one last time?24720I'm sure you've noticed 'em, . They're everywhere!What am I talking about? Why, the crystals, of course!The crystals... They're all over the crater. Most people ignore them, but I have a strange feeling that they hold power within them.Say, I'm running a little low on the crystals I have here -- think you might be able to collect some more for me?  You'll find yellow crystals to the northwest, red crystals to the... oh, I'm sure you'll figure it out.24721High up in the cliffs above me there is a large crystal pylon.  Who placed it there, I cannot say, nor can I determine any reason that it would be built in such a strange place.Maybe you can make more of it than I can.  I personally don't care what it does, so you needn't report back to me, but perhaps one of the scholars in Marshal's Stand might be interested in what you discover.24722You've done us a number of favors, ... now let Gremix do one for you.  The attacks on Marshal's Refuge were terrible, undoubtedly.  They came without warning, and took no prisoners.  They were lucky that so many of them survived.A few weeks ago, I came across a crystal pylon in the cliffs to the northeast of here, east of Marshal's Refuge.  I think the pylon and the attacks may be related somehow.  Maybe you can investigate?  I'm sure someone in Marshal's Stand will thank you.24723Durrin's research touched on one area that intrigues me: a potential link between the titans and the dinosaurs.  J.D. Collie back at camp is always talking about titan this and crystal that... maybe she'd be interested.Before you report to her, you might want to check out the crystal pylon not far from here.  It's just up in the cliffs, to the west of here.  It's got crystals on it, and it always seemed to me like it might have something to do with the titans.24724247252472624727247282472924730You'd think that being chief digger for Marshal Expeditions means I like digging.  There might be worse things to do in this world... but none really leap to mind.We were supposed to be digging in Terror Run - FANTASTIC name by the way - for dead stegodons and diemetradons.  Well, there are plenty of live ones there too!  Wil and Hol are still all about studying this death trap, so we need those dinosaur bones.  Between you and me though, bringing some from live ones will work out just as well.24731Once, a long time ago, a brother of mine took some meat from one of Lar'korwi's kills. He didn't know it at the time, but Lar'korwi saw him from the forest. Lar'korwi followed my brother for days, destroying everything he touched. My brother, scared, finally decided to run from the Crater and leave Lar'korwi behind.Lar'korwi killed him not far from this spot.If you want to provoke Lar'korwi, find a fresh kill of his and take some of the meat from it.Start your search to the west.24732I'm actually surprised he has not come for you yet, . But all is well, for I have a final plan that will bring the monster to us.Being the dominant male gives Lar'korwi rights to breed with any female he chooses--and he chooses many of them. You'll find many ravasaur eggs to the west of here. Get close to them and you should provoke an attack by his mates. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed. Bring me two of those glands.24733This will be the most difficult part because there is some complexity to the plan.  Continue following the river to the north, and look for a bend in the river.  It was here I saw Lar'korwi last.  You will know you are in the right area because of all the bones from massive creatures that once wandered nearby.Take the meat you recovered and place it there.  Then, rub this mixture I created on the meat.If both lures mingled together do not bring Lar'korwi to you, then I know nothing else that will.24734You've got to help me, ! My friend, Ringo left earlier to explore the volcano to the north of here, and he has been gone way too long. I am really worried about him.Do you think you could find him? Why don't you take my canteen with you -- if you do find Ringo, I'm sure he'll need it!24735Ugh... It's so hot...I was exploring this area, when all of a sudden, the heat just became unbearable. I must be suffering from heat exhaustion.Please, help me get back to my friend Spraggle at Marshal's Stand. I think I'm well enough to follow you there.I am feeling a little out of it, so you can slap me if I'm feeling woozy.  If I do happen to faint again, just splash some water on me from Spraggle's canteen. That should work, I hope...24736I'm making a flying machine!I got stranded here, and I'm absolutely horrible at finding my way around. I'd take a gryphon or wind rider back to Gadgetzan, but those beasts just scare me to death.So, will you help me? All I have left to build is the wings, and I was thinking that the webby scales from the pterrordax in the Screaming Reaches to the west would be perfect. There's no way I'm going to go up against one of those, but you look pretty tough. Why don't you give it a try?24737I'm always looking for a quick way to earn a gold, . If you help me with my newest idea, I'll let you in on a little of the profit. How does that sound to you?I thought so!We're going to be making some glue. Head to the tar pits just north of here, and collect me some tar. Not just any tar, now, you'll need to get it from the beasts that live around the tar pits. As a bonus, if you use my tar scraper on their corpses, you'll keep your hands nice and clean.24740Welcome.  I'm Williden Marshal, and my sister and I run this expedition of explorers and scientists.  You have a moment?I don't like the look of those elementals on that volcano, .  We have too much equipment, too many notes... one crazed elemental could streak its way through our camp and do terrible, terrible damage.Show them that their new neighbors aren't to be trifled with.  And bring back the ash that they leave behind... we might as well do a little science while we're at it.24741Hobart thinks he's going to feed us on those tiny clucker eggs? Bah! We're going to get some real eggs!I've already set up some traps on the Raptor Rise up the path to the east. Take this bunch of wild clucker eggs and lay them in the traps. The spiny raptors will go right after the clucker eggs, and then you'll get to trade up to their larger eggs.Genius!24742I created a thermometer to take readings of the temperatures at the volcano, and I'd like to find the hottest lava flows.  It gives the measurements in degrees Kraklenheit!Here, take it, and take readings of the temperatures at the ridge whenever you see a hot spot!Hot spots usually take the form of a glowing, rocky pillar jutting out of the ground.  You'll find them around the base of Fire Plume Ridge... one trip around the perimeter will likely suffice.2474324744Bamm Megabomb? Who does he think he is? His spiny raptor eggs are no match for what we are about to recover!As you well know, each Town-In-A-Box is equipped with a micro mechachicken for just such a dietary emergency. Luckily for us, my keen intellect was able to deduce the location that our prodigious, pre-programmed poultry ran off to.Head north to the Scorched Gully. But beware, its circuit boards are fried and I imagine it's not so micro any longer!24745The inside of the card is scribbled with mad, detailed plans to infect most of Azeroth.

But don't you think we should be taking care of the pygmies that are creating them as well?At the three Oostan villages, Nord, Sor, and Ost, there are witch doctors: Gaahl, Malmo, and Teloch.Maybe you could take care of them? I don't want to be turned into a zombie!24946I'll give these pygmies one thing... they sure know how to party! But they're not so clever. I think I've discovered the source of their rockin' powers: Rockin' Powder!It turns out that this stuff, which turns them into world-class rockers, is also highly explosive. We must have it!So, while you're in there at Oostan to the east, make sure that you pickup a whole bunch of the stuff. Trust me, you're going to need it for what's coming up!24947We can't just rest on our laurels here, babe. We've got to keep this momentum going! People are talking about us.Unfortunately, they're also talking about this air-headed gnome, Kelsey, who's apparently been running jobs right alongside us. If we're going to drive her out of what's rightfully a goblin town, we need to seal the deal here.We're going to take care of Gadgetzan's pirate problem for them, for good. Head south to Lost Rigger Cove, I'll meet you there.24948We'll never be able to re-secure the fortress walls so long as Rageroar and his goons have access to artillery. I need you to fight your way across that chasm and take out his big guns.Orcs season their heavy machinery with coal tar, which makes them flammable. Take my torch and burn any catapults you see north of Northwatch.Then, torch those big blade-throwers in Rageroar's base camp! Those things have killed enough of our men.24949Let's not be wasteful here, babe. These pirates have tons of valuable nonsense just sitting around, waiting to be fenced. Can you believe they just sit on this stuff?I mean, why do they even bother taking it if it's just going to sit around? Stolen goods should be sold off and used to buy shiny new things.Anyway, be a dear and go grab as much of their loot as you can carry while you're out busting heads. Ciao!24950Alright, babe, I've got something bigger for you to take on here.We spotted the captain of the Southsea over on one of his boats to the south; that's to the south, and NOT the one we've been suicidally bum-rushing for the better part of several hours. He's sitting up there, smug and stoic, watching us war down here.I'll spare you the \"hostile takeover\" jokes. Get on his ship and beat the tar out of him, and we're done here!24951Now that we've got a good pile of fresh chunks, we just tie it to this rope...and now you're ready to go catch me a silithid.What? Don't give me that look, it's perfectly safe. Well, mostly safe. Okay, you might die painfully. But it'll be easy! Just throw this meat out there, wait for a bug to pounce on it, and then drag 'em back here by the rope!Go after one of the swarmers. I haven't seen the other ones go for hyenas before, and you should find plenty of swarmers around the edge of the pit.24952You need to get those boots down into the caldera to Hobart Grapplehammer.Now that they're infused with the leftover rockin' powder, they should have enough thrust to get you all the way there on one shot.When you're ready, activate the boots. Don't worry, they're automatically set to land you safely.I think.24953Now it's time for my plan to go into full effect. We've got the captured bug strapped up with as many explosives as it can carry, and with Soothfancy's mostly amazing mental powers, we're gonna drive that sucker straight down into the center of the underground hive.And then...BOOM! No more bugs!You get the personal honor of directin' the ugly thing. Go talk to Narain and get set up with your bug-pal.24954Volcanoth is the turtle god in the cave that these primitives worship.It's not really a god.But it is tough enough that I'm going to have to devise a new weapon for you from the one functioning boot we have left.I think that the age-old motto of \"fight fire with fire\" applies here. Plus, I like fire!Let's get some fire glands from Volcanoth's children. That should give me time to modify the rocket boot into something more fitting.24955As I may have mentioned, I'm trying to get these Dunemaul ogres to join the Horde..and  work for the Bilgewater Cartel as cheap local labor.To pull this off, we've gotta pay lip service to the actual initiation process and all that, or I'm going to catch flak later on. So I've gotten this charter drawn up, and slapped the initiation rites onto our own limited time offer labor stipulation contract.I've got a disguise for you here, so suit up and get all these signatures filled out.24956I have encountered the Rageroar clan before, . They are led not by an orc, but by a monster - a war-gorged fiend without a shred of decency or compassion. He and his lieutenants must be killed, not just to save Northwatch, but for the good of all of Azeroth.Karga Rageroar wears a helm. Execute him, , and bring the helm to me. It is of ... particular importance.Rageroar has made his camp across the chasm, east of here.24957Okay, babe. Like I said, the ogres are too dumb to know what signing that charter meant. Now we have to actually get them to come along with us, so we'll be procuring what is apparently beloved local flavor.Beloved local flavor for drooling idiots, I mean.Just pop on over to the Noxious Lair to the west, it's that big horrible pit full of dangerous silithid. Kill a bunch of the Centipaar silithid and bring back the pieces so we can hand 'em out, okay? Ciao.24958It took a lot of blood, sweat, and tears, but the Bootzooka, patent-pending, is ready for use!These no-good pygmies have been feeding our people to their \"god\", Volcanoth, and they're about to unleash it on our town!You have to get into the cave and kill that thing before it's too late!24959!Rise, !Welcome back to the realm of the living.  With the blessing and power of the Dark Lady, I have freed you from death's grip.You are no slave, .  You are free to follow whatever path you choose from here.  If you choose to serve the Dark Lady Sylvanas, I recommend you speak with Undertaker Mordo.  You will find him behind me, in the graveyard.24960King, peasant, or ... I don't care WHAT you were before.  I just need somebody with a working tongue.Being raised from the dead is strenuous.  Not everyone copes with it as well as you did.  In particular, there are three newly-raised undead who are having trouble coping right now.I want you to find them and talk to them.  It might be that they just need someone that they can relate with.You'll find them here in the graveyard.24961Earlier on, I saw a young Forsaken woman running towards the old inn.  She was screaming for her life, pleading to be taken back home.Not all of us are as resolute as others, .  Even so, we must accept our fate as undead if we are to rise up against those that would put us down.Take my hand mirror and show it to the young woman.  She needs to see what she really is, and join us in our cause.  Besides... we can use all the bodies that we can get.24962Ah, while you were off dealing with the mindless Scourge, this scroll arrived for you. I would think it's some matter of importance as it seems it bears the seal of the hunter trainer Xavier. I would take some time to read it before heading out again.24963Okay, babe, listen up. There's two ways to get people to do what you want. You can provide goods, services, and things people want...or you can beat the living daylights out of them.I've often found it's useful to do both at the same time, and you're pretty familiar with both methods by now. Take these little silithid treats, go and beat some ogres dizzy, and then give them the treat before you knock them completely dead, 'kay?24964I've been told that I'm supposed to train you how to be a hunter.  That's all well and good, but in my opinion, you'll get more training out in the field than you will talking about theories with me.Go out, get some more experience, and see if you learn any new tricks. Then you can come back and show me.24965Let's get some work done, shall we?As you grow in power, your connection to the arcane will deepen, granting you access to new spells.You'll see. Go, get some more experience, then come back and demonstrate what you've learned.24966A Forsaken priest is a curious beast, path an unusual course.$G His: Her; shadowy rites cannot come from the Light, so  seeks a more sinister source.Not only has the world forsaken us, ... it seems the Light has left us as well.  As the poem hints, however... we are not without power.Go, get more experience, grow your power. Return to me, and demonstrate what you have learned.24967Quiet down!  I don't want these novices around us to hear what we're about to discuss.Listen up... , is it? Soon, you'll learn something that'll change the way you operate as a rogue.  You'll be able to follow up on your attacks with a deadly finishing move. Maybe even slide a dagger between their vertebrae.To learn it, you just gotta get some more experience. Don't worry, you'll figure it out.24968As you continue your career as a warlock, you'll begin to hear the voices of fel power... they will reveal their secrets, teaching you new spells.I want to see you learn a new spell and try it out on one of the dummies here.24969If you want to become a stronger warrior, you'll need to work on your weapons.  You'll find stronger swords and larger shields out on your adventures, that I have no doubt about.But it isn't just your physical armory that will get stronger - you'll also begin to discover new techniques. Go, get some experience, learn something new, then come back and show me.24970While you were inside that cave, your big friend Darnell came by with some alarming news.Since the val'kyr arrived, we've seen more and more undead that chose not to join our forces under the banner of the Dark Lady.  They've been gathering at a small camp here in the valley, and now they've organized forces.They plan to attack Deathknell, .Darnell is just down the road, to the east.  Be careful, .  While those undead aren't completely brainless, they're still not quite right in the head.24971While you were taking care of matters for Executor Arren, I went off on an assignment of my own.  Shadow Priest Sarvis asked me to peek in on the Rotbrain camp.There's a reason why they're called Rotbrains.Their leader goes by the name of Marshal Redpath, and he's an absolute beast.Look, ... the attack is starting.  You're better in combat than I am.  Get in there and help out!When you're done, meet up with Shadow Priest Sarvis in the chapel.  Good luck, .24972These will need to be taken to my field agent, Deathguard Simmer.  This information contains the whereabouts of the last few holdouts from the Scarlet Crusade.  We will destroy these crusaders, once and for all.  And I have a feeling you'll be instrumental in that effort, .Take the road north out of Deathknell.  Soon after entering Tirisfal proper, you'll see a large manse.  Simmer's inside.24973One of our greatest struggles is obtaining the natural resources we need to survive.  Gold was scarce in Lordaeron, even in the height of the Alliance's power so many years ago.There is a gold mine to the west that has been overrun with spiders.  We need gold from the mine, but we can't very well get it while the spiders are crawling around in there.  I've not much manpower to commit to the task, so we'll just have to do it little by little.Get up there and see what you can do for us, .24974You work hard your whole life, and what do you get?  Killed by a plague.  Then you work even harder in undeath, and what do you get?  Money, yes, and a small estate with a few pesky hangers-on, but happiness?  Not so much.I'm lonely in my old age, .  I need a companion.  Use this leash on one of the murlocs at the Whispering Shore to the northwest.  You'll have to weaken it first before it can be leashed.  Then bring it back to me.24975What have we here?  You look like a fledgling .  If you hope to prove yourself to the Dark Lady, you need to learn the ways of the Forsaken.To the west you'll find a farm.  Humans infest the land like mold on a rotting corpse.  And worse yet, the Scarlet Crusade patrols nearby from their tower.  Teach those scum a lesson and steal 10 of their precious pumpkins.Once you have 10, bring them back to me.24976These pumpkins have a purpose, .  They'll be the delivery mechanism for my latest batch of plague, which should be a particularly painful and virulent concoction.  However, the plague requires a few rare ingredients.We'll need Marrowpetals, which grow at the bottom of Stillwater Pond, just to the east of here.  We'll also need Xavren's thorn, which grows on rocky cliffs to the northwest.  Finally, we need some briny sea cucumbers, found in the surf off of Whispering Shore.24977Harmless pumpkins, right?  Or so it would seem.  If we are to defeat the Scourge advances from the North and the human infestation from the South we need to start realizing the full potential of our gift of undeath.With a little ingenuity a simple pumpkin becomes an agent for our Dark Lady.  This pumpkin, laced with my latest formula, will prove to be quite a treat.Yet another Scarlet Zealot has been captured and is being kept outside, by the gazebo.  Take this pumpkin to the fool.24978Humans are notoriously fickle creatures.  The farmers to the west are no exception.  Sure, they may be plowing their fields peacefully now, but tomorrow, they may be raising their scythes against us.  The Alliance looms close by in Gilneas, and the power of Stormwind looms to the south... any of these could recruit these tillers and use them as a wedge against us.I want them dead.  See to it that it's done.24979Lieutenant Gebler:How curious that you would decide to take a prisoner... an undead one at that.  What were you thinking?  Do you think that, just because of the prisoner's former status, that she would be above the edicts of the Scarlet Crusade?This is most troubling, Gebler.  I would remind you that there are penalties for such behavior.  I command you to execute the prisoner at once.  She is no longer one of us.24980We need someone with \"initiative\" like yourself to drive the Scarlet Crusade to the grave.Prove to me you are capable of serving The Dark Lady by travelling west to the tower past the Solliden Farmstead and slaying 10 warriors of the Scarlet Crusade.24981Information we've received from Executor Arren in Deathknell contain all the details we need to wipe the human infestation from the lands.  According to the information, The Scarlet Crusade has assigned Captain Perrine and a brigade to the ruined tower southwest of Brill.Kill 3 of his zealots and 3 of his missionaries.  And while you're there, see if you can dig up any other information about what they're up to.24982Speaking frankly, the Forsaken of yesteryear were a sniveling, pathetic group.  We huddled together in decrepit old human buildings, hiding from the Scourge, cowering from the Alliance, and groveling at the foot of the Horde.Look before you now, and see the product of the new Forsaken.  We have made our mark here on Azeroth, and that mark will grow.  Our dominion will soon blanket the world!You want my advice?  Speak with Magistrate Sevren in Brill, down this road.  He runs that town.24983I need a fresh report from our Deathguard waystation to the east.I must know if more Scourge forces have slipped past The Bulwark and into Tirisfal.  Our vigilance on the border to the Plaguelands must be maintained - we can't let the Scourge get a stronger foothold here!Travel south along the road, then east at the fork to the waystation.  Speak with Deathguard Linnea.  She has the information I need.24988It's so cold, now.  The Plague of Undeath crawls through my veins like an icy serpent.  The mindless state will be upon me soon.  But no doomed destiny will prevent me from serving our Dark Lady.  When the call arose I sewed body bags for the fallen soldiers of Sylvanas's mighty army.Now my hands shake from the chill.  If you would bring me five duskbat pelts, I could sew myself a blanket.  Help me, , so that I can continue to serve the cause.24989You should return to Magistrate Sevren with the information I gave you.  He'll want it as soon as possible, so be swift.24990Lady Sylvanas has called upon the Royal Apothecary Society.  She has challenged us to concoct a new plague, a plague deadlier than any ailment on Azeroth. This new disease will bring our enemies - living and dead - to ruin.My studies show that the blood of beasts might prove to be the key. Here, fill these vials with darkhound blood so I can test my theory.24991As you're probably already realizing, the Royal Apothecary Society is a widespread organization.  We take our plague-alchemy seriously.  It is our belief that the more agents we have performing experiments, the sooner we will realize our objective.One of our agents performs his work at a small encampment to the north of here.  His name is Jerrod, and he could use an apprentice of your... stature.24992As far as you know, a worgen rogue roaming in Tirisfal is a new development.  This is something that Executor Zygand would certainly be interested in.24993These worgen must be dealt with, and quickly.  Our first priority is to eliminate any which may have infiltrated Brill.I want you to be on the lookout for any suspicious activity here in Brill, .  We know that these worgen can hide in the shadows, so look for any signs you can find... footsteps, kicked-up rocks... anything.24994My envoy just delivered me a bushel of gloom weed.  Gloom weed!  I don't need gloom weed, I need doom weed!  You can see the predicament that I'm in, .I'll make it worth your while to gather what I need. Bring back to me enough doom weed and I'll give you a suitable reward.It is my understanding that they like to plague the flora near the mass gravesite, to the north of the Brill graveyard. Hurry and be mindful of the gnolls in the area.24995While you were collecting samples for me, my experiments led me to realize that more reagents will be required for this new disease to spread properly.  Poisoning some hapless victim is child's play.  Plaguing an entire world proves to be a bit more complicated.I will need several scales from murlocs in the vicinity.  You will find the creatures ambling brainlessly along the coast to the north.24996I am to understand that another one of those foolish Dwarven Mountaineers has just been captured.  The deathguard has him stored here in this building, and they've assigned one of their own to persuade him not to escape.Why don't you go see how the Captured Mountaineer enjoys this special drink I made for him?  It contains a subtle hint of what The Dark Lady has planned for the rest of Azeroth.24997The mass graves within the forest to the west of us were made to accommodate the... impressive... number of deaths Tirisfal suffered when the plague first came.  The bodies in these graves have so far been spared an undeath, but the Scourge now send Rot Hide gnolls to gather the corpses and use them to bolster their armies.  This cannot be allowed!Your task is twofold: slay the Rot Hides at the mass grave and Garren's Haunt, and gather from them the embalming ichor that gives them life.24998Maggot Eye is a foul beast, even by gnoll standards.  He leads a band of renegade gnolls through the land, tearing up the glades and stealing whatever corpses he can find along the way.Those are our corpses!  We had plans for those!Maggot Eye resides just up the path from us.  Show him no mercy.  Mercy is for the weak.24999It seems that Jerrod has you hunting the murlocs to the north.  That's good... we can use their parts for our poisons.  I get a little worried sometimes, though...The Vile Fin spawning grounds are not far off Tirisfal's northern coast, so you'll probably notice several tadpoles among the adults on the shore.  If these impressionable young murlocs were to seek revenge against us... that could ruin us.  Go chase them, and show them that the Forsaken and the Horde are not to be trifled with.25000Hey, !Are you headed to support Corporal Teegan? He's in charge of keeping the supply routes open.He's got two of the most ornery dwarves I've ever met in charge of sundries. If you want to make an impression on those two crotchety hunters, you're going to need to show that you can hold your own against the predators around here.The raptors west of the hold here are especially vicious. Bring Goucho some fresh hides and you'll make an impression while supplying the troops in one swoop.25001My other assistants are making sure our proud new comrades are put into comfy cages and shipped to where they're needed most. For the Horde. Meanwhile, we've got one last item on our agenda.Sandscraper, the chief of the Dunemaul Clan, is probably too dumb to even be aware of what we're doing here. But I absolutely loathe unfinished business, babe. He's lurking in the den just over there to the west. Knuckle down, take him out, and we'll be good to sign off on this, 'kay?2500225003The strongest point in the mills is the Agamand Family Crypt.  With necromancy, Captain Dargol has raised the ancestors of the Agamands and plans to use them against us.This cannot pass, and you must stop it.  Travel to the Agamand Family Crypt and defeat the raised Agamand ancestors.25004The Scourge are trying to form a base here at the Agamand Mills.  If they do, then they can stage further attacks within Tirisfal.The orders have been given.  The Scourge in the Mills must be destroyed.Collect Notched Ribs from Rattlecage and Cracked Skull Soldiers, and Blackened Skulls from Darkeye Bonecasters.25005I have destroyed the remains you've given me, .  That is, all remains except for these...Devlin Agamand was weak and sharp-tongued in life, and was among the first to succumb to the plague.  He existed as a slave of the Scourge for a long time, longer than most.  As such, he may possess knowledge that would be of value to us.Bring his remains to Magistrate Sevren, and tell him what I've told you.  He'll know what to do.25006While the Frozen Throne lies dormant, the grasp that the Lich King once held over the Scourge grows ever-weaker.  His grip on a weakling like Devlin Agamand should be weak enough that we can remove it entirely.Speak with Shadow Priestess Malia in the manor on the east side of town.  She will assist you in the procedure.25007You've done much for us here, , but  of your caliber are needed elsewhere.To the east lies the Bulwark: a fortified barricade against the ravages of the Plaguelands.  The Bulwark protects us from Scourge invasions, and has allowed us enough sanctity to build up our forces here in Tirisfal Glades.Go, speak with High Executor Derrington.  He is an ally, and will doubtless appreciate whatever aid you can give him.25008You probably caught wind of some of them Hecklefang scavengers on the way in - they reek worse than ol' Durty Pete here. Worthless animals! They steal our kills, rummage through our supplies, and worse... they ain't good for eatin'.Go kill some.Then kill some more, if you want to.25009Though the strength of the Scarlet Crusade wanes, we are still at war.  The report Executor Arren sent me indicates Scarlet Crusaders have been raiding from the ruined tower in southeastern Tirisfal near the Balnir Farmstead under the command of Captain Vachon.Kill 3 of his zealots and 4 of his friars. It should prove to be a devastating blow to the Crusade!25010Shortly before you arrived at the Bulwark, I was approached by the most unusual young undead woman.  She swore enmity against the Scarlet Crusade, so I sent her to work on our enemies to the north.  You say you saw some dead crusaders earlier?  Those were probably her work.Go check up on her, and see if she can use any assistance in her vendetta against the Crusade... though I wouldn't be surprised if she's already killed them all.25011There isn't much more glory for you here on the Bulwark, .  You've done enough already.  There may, however, be further adventures waiting in Silverpine Forest.Speak with my bat man, Timothy Cunningham.  He'll give you a ride to Brill, free of charge.25012If you're headed back to Brill, you'll want to stop by Executor Zygand on your way out.  I hear there's some excitement going on in Silverpine Forest, to the south.  He'll know more than I do.Speak with me again when you're ready to head out.25013Hmm... this isn't quite there.  It needs something to give at a little more zing.  I've got it!  The spiders to the north have a potent venom that'll do the trick.  See if you can extract some for me, ?25014Inside this weathered stone chest at the back of Stonescraper's lair, you find a curious artifact.Shaped like a beetle, its surface is a smooth, brilliant blue, lined with gold. It looks mechanical, but unlike anything you've seen crafted by mortal hands, and very old.Megs will probably be interested in this.25015One of the native species in Kalimdor is the 'quilboar.' Prickly little buggers. Reason enough to hate this continent.The raids started shortly after we established our forward camps. Worse, those spiny fiends seem to thrive in this thorny hell of a jungle. I need you to help beat them back so we can re-establish contact with Forward Command.While you're out there, acquire one of those twisted branches their casters seem to be using to manipulate the jungle growth...25017For years, this valley has been sealed behind impenetrable gates. Now that the cataclysm has torn them down, the secrets within are ours to discover.There are yet some obstacles in the way. From within the gates, the bygone creations of the titans have awoken. They wander aimlessly across the sand, attacking any who approach.Someone needs to destroy the golems patrolling the valley; are you up to it?25018Listen carefully, . I don't know how those ogres got ahold of it, but that thing's a titan artifact. I'm no expert, but just that fact alone makes it probably older than the sand we're standing on.I also know that things like this are nothing but trouble. I don't want anything to do with it. Take it south, to the Valley of the Watchers, and give it to a blood elf named Andoren Dawnrise there. And don't ask any questions, babe, please.25019We are not the only ones who have discovered the value of the Southmoon Ruins. The dwarves of the Explorers' League have swarmed there, taking artifacts and inscriptions for the Alliance.I don't think I have to explain much further. We will not allow the discoveries here to fall into the hands of the Alliance. Slay as many dwarves as you can, and drive them from the ruins!25020At the Southmoon ruins, just east of here, we've made some finds. My colleagues have found stone shards, engraved with ancient writings, newly exposed by the shifting sands.The writings are in no known tongue, though they bear resemblance to markings we've seen on other ruins of the titans. Deciphering them could reveal many more secrets.Unfortunately, my colleagues are also busy defending the tablets from the Alliance. I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and retrieve the tablets yourself.25021To survive in de harsh desert, de Sandfury had to learn all de secrets of blood magic. You drink de blood, you get de power...darkest voodoo, yah? But dere be no room for holdin' back out here.If we gonna find de sword, we need blood. Lucky for ya, Mazoga be a traitor, yah? And dere be plenty of Sandfury trolls wanderin' over de hills dere.Go an' get Mazoga blood...plenty of blood...and we make de ritual to find Jang'thraze.25022I told him he was a fool, but Ambassador Gaines insisted he could negotiate an alliance with the quilboar against the Horde. Even if he succeeded, I for one wouldn't want to fight with those ... pig-men at my side.Well, Gaines hasn't returned, and General Hawthorne will hold me accountable if I lose one of our best negotiators to these squealing savages.Locate the Ambassador in this steaming mess of a jungle and rescue him if he's still alive.25023Alright then, grab onto the ladder. We gotta get outa here!We'll make a flyby of the town, and then I'm gonna get you to some old friends!25024The Alliance have caught back up with us at just the wrong moment, my friend. We took care of their ships, but they still have planes that are dropping their vaunted 127th Paratroopers onto the coast below.It's all that the battlesworn and scouts can do to hold the two ramps against their overwhelming numbers. I'm certain that if you were to aid them, the tide would quickly be turned.25025The blood speaks. I can feel its flow through the sand...drenched in death, a desert of suffering...There! The blood flows to the south, in a valley of bones. Zakkaru! Zakkaru, spawn of Makkari, the dark one who demands sacrifice... his father forced from Zul'Farrak, his ascension interrupted... he will taste blood once more...Go, . Zakkaru has Sang'thraze. Ya not be wanting him to keep it, trust me.25026Jang'thraze eludes me, mon... de blood is not enough.

She's been twisting the thorns of this crazy jungle to her own ends, and it was her orders that Gaines be \"torn apart and fed to the overgrowth.\" Nice lady.Let's give her a taste of her own. Take the Bramblestaff you recovered, and use it on Three-Tooth to take her out of the picture. Then kill the crones she's been training, to ensure nobody else can take her place.25028Teegan's a fool to think the quilboar caused this sudden overgrowth. Look around you. I've been watching these plants bloom and sprout daily - each generation is more mutated than the last. This isn't tribal magic - it's something primal. And dangerous.The day before last a great druid passed through our camp. Seek out Naralex, somewhere in the midst of this jungle. He'll know what to do.And bring him some plant samples from around the overgrowth to help his studies.25029The Agamand family was the most prosperous family in Tirisfal Glades.  I used to work their mills...before the plague.When the Scourge first came, the Agamands fortified their home and convinced those in their employ to remain and help them defend.  We were fools, but at least we were loyal fools.The Agamands, in their pride, doomed us to undeath.  And now they are minions of the Scourge!Serve the Forsaken by defeating the Agamands who fell to the plague.  Serve me by bringing me their remains.25030You sense a malign presence coming from within the skull of the beast.  Coleman Farthing may be interested in seeing this.25031The Agamand Mills, to the west, have been lost to the Scourge.  The Agamand family has been slain, and the entire residence has been claimed by the Scourge.This is probably the largest Scourge outpost in Tirisfal, .  If you think you're enough of a , head up there and speak with Coleman Farthing.  He's been doing his best to take the land back, and he'll need help.  Just follow this road, it'll take you right to him.25032Yes, I see the other half now, mon...to the south...We be close now, mon. It's in an oasis, buried in de muck beneath de water. Don't delay!25034I'd love to keep you here behind the lines, but it looks like you've been summoned to the front. Ambassador Gaines - remember him? - has relocated to Forward Command and in his latest missive he's requested you, personally, to assist him.You'll find our Forward Command operation south of here, in what's become known as the \"Fields of Blood.\"Be careful, . The Horde has taken to ambushing some of our officers en route.25035Vol'jin be callin' for an all out attack on da naga that have taken over our northern isle. Many of our men were already engaged with their forces near da bridge, but several of us are breakin' through their lines ta assault their isle itself.Speak to Jornun right 'ere to secure a ride to da isle. Once there, seek out Morakki, da Captain of da Watch. He will be tellin' ya how ya can aid in da battle.25036The Admiral will be pleased that Northwatch is almost secured, but if we're to keep a grip on this continent we're going to need to maintain the supply lines to the interior.Just before the assault I received the strangest of reports from Corporal Teegan, who's in charge of maintaining our contact with Forward Command. Says he's having trouble with the \"jungle?\" There's no jungle in the Barrens!Follow the upper road out of Northwatch and see if you can render any assistance to our wayward Corporal.25037Perhaps me agin' body is just growin' too picky after all dese years, but boar meat just ain't goin' down easy no more. More for da new recruits I be thinkin'.We just set out some crab traps, but if ya be willin' ta help an impatient old troll, I'd love ta have some fresh crawler meat right now. Dey're all around da island, but da best spot ta be huntin' them is off da eastern coast.25038Master want weeds. Us gots big hands and not good at picking. You help us and we not hurt you. Us need gloom weed. Many weeds around here and near road.When you have gloom weed you take to Master Holland in Brill.25039!  Listen up, I got somethin'... odd to discuss.I was out fishin' by Brightwater Lake when I saw the darnedest thing... some sorta wolf-man, running around Tirisfal.  Ya don't suppose that could be a... worgen, do ya?Anyway, I keep tellin' myself I should tell Executor Zygand about it, but I just get so scared when I talk to that guy.  Maybe you could talk with him?25041Respect the lion, ! A ferocious killer. You gotta admire the elegance of the beast... Muscle and claws... Running down its food... So primal...I'm sorry, my mind wandered. As I was saying, I respect these lions, but they're just murder on our patrols. I mean that literally. The men are afraid to go to the bathroom alone at night. Can you help make our camp a little safer?Barrens lions like to linger under trees.25042It's true what they say: An army marches on its stomach. And we've been marching a long way.I'm thinking if we barbecue up a few of those giant lumbering stormsnouts, we'll have enough meat to feed us for weeks.Stormsnouts are big and slow, so they should be easy to kill. Except... Hey you're not carrying any metal on you are you?25043The Horde has taken to calling this region the \"Fields of Blood.\" It's an apt name: these reeds run red with the blood of some of my best men.I've sent out recon patrols to crush the quilboar and report on the Horde troop movements, but not all of them return. They could use your support out there.Patrol the fields and seek out the Desolation Grunts that are causing us so much grief. Do not expect them to surrender; their Warchief has instructed them to fight to the death.25044I have not forgotten my brush with death at the hands of the quilboar in that filthy jungle. The General here has ordered some tactical strikes, but he stops short of genocide. I have no such qualms.Take this horn that I 'borrowed' during my negotiations. Blow the horn within the Bristleback challenge ring west of our position - you can't miss it. I want you to challenge the champion of the Bristleback, Sabersnout, to single combat. His death in front of his followers will leave them in utter chaos.25045Strategically, control of a region requires constant observation. See here on this map - I've identified a number of strategic hills, similar to this one, that the Alliance must acquire if we are to keep the enemy under our thumb.My scouts have already marked their location on the field. What I need is someone to spearhead their capture, and you're the  for the job.Seek out neutral grey flags on hills to the north, east, and south of the Taurajo Ruins. Capture one and defend it!25046The whisper continues:25047This badly broken figurine was discarded by its last owner.  However, with the right materials and your skill in jewelcrafting, it could be completely restored.25048If we want to convince Mister Noggenfogger to let us move more gnomes here, we've got to show him just how nice we are! I know just the thing.Gadgetzan's under blockade by pirates, but plenty of the goods that get blown off the ships survive intact... they just wash away. Most of them wash up in the shallows just south of town.If you could go collect those supplies for them, it'd help us make friends! And it'll keep that mean goblin girl over there from taking them and selling them.25049There's a big problem here! It's great that the ocean came in so far, because now ships can get to Gadgetzan. But now there's a bunch of nasty old sea giants encroaching on the town! I'm sure Mister Noggenfogger would appreciate us taking care of them for him.Don't worry, I won't ask you to do it just out of the goodness of your heart! Take care of them and I'll give you a reward!25050When the water came in, Steamwheedle Port to the east was flooded, and a lot of poor goblins are still stuck there! Now those mean pirates are shooting at any boat that leaves the docks here.But they won't expect us to fly! There's a hot air balloon by the docks. We can use that, fly over to rescue the goblins, and take care of the pirates, too. Mr. Noggenfogger will be so pleased!Go to the docks and hop in the balloon and I'll be right behind you, okay? I've got to get some rockets...25051The spiders that occupy Darkmist Cavern to the northwest are another vicious threat to us here. They are nothing the ogres cannot handle, but splitting our attention to them when Theramore's forces lurk nearby is a deadly mistake.I need someone to destroy the eggs inside Darkmist Cavern, to cut off this infestation. You will find the eggs in the deepest part of the webbed mines... along with their guardians.25052Well gosh, as you can plainly see there's this really big battle with these pirates here going on. We're doing our best to make sure they never bother Gadgetzan or our new gnomish homes there ever again!By killing them.So how about helping us? We really wanna make sure we kill more than green-nose over there and her awful thugs. I'd really appreciate it!25053You know, this place would probably make a great home for us gnomes if it wasn't so old and dirty and full of pirates! We're taking care of the pirates problem, but the awful and dirty problem needs fixing.I mean, no self-respecting gnome would ever live in such an ugly hovel like these buildings! So here, take this bottle of flaming rum and go burn those ugly shacks down for us!25054It's just really so wasteful that all these pirates have golden treasures lying around. Some of this stuff could be used for practical things! Like melting into wire, or intrinsic shielding matrices, or selling to other stupid races that buy gold just to keep it around.And speaking of other stupid races, I bet those greedy goblins are going to be taking all of it. We can't let that happen! Go collect that treasure for Gnomeregan!25056Have you seen the plagued bruins that wander to the west of here?  Those hides... so hideous, so diseased, so... perfect!Fetch me 5 of them.  I've got an idea for an anti-Scourge poison that's guaranteed to succeed!25057Our policy of conscripting non-violent criminals from the Stormwind Stockades has come back to haunt us, . Some of my less-scrupulous soldiers broke ranks after our victory in Taurajo and are looting the remains of the city.This is a breakdown in discipline. Worse, the desecration of their homes only spurs the enemy to fight harder when our ultimate goal should be peace.Take these manacles and bring the Taurajo looters to justice. Speak to them first, but you may need force to subdue them.25058The paratroopers have mined the beach!The Warchief asked me if there's anything we can do about that. I told him, 'You bet we can!'. I was thinking maybe you could take this satchel of grenades and detonate the land mines from a safe distance?It's how we do things, right?!25059The General is too preoccupied with the looters in Taurajo. Too soft! We ought to be focused on our next move against the Horde.There's valuable intelligence that might be compromised if we allow the ruins of Taurajo to continue to burn. While you're running the General's errand, dig around for any maps or notes you can find. I can speak a little of the orcish tongue - I'll be able to make sense of what you find.25060We received reports that a goblin shipwreck occured on this beach some time ago, with the survivors left to fend for themselves. We expected there to be a modicum of survivors, perhaps some even suitable for interrogation.What we found was a crew of Bilgewater goblins who have all become insane, delusional, and maniacally violent...to further degrees than is normally observed, rather.In short, they are useless and dangerous. Gnomeregan will be best served by cutting down as many as we can.25061Psst! Hey! Come closer, you fool, you expect me to read your mind or--oh. Come closer anyway!You've done a wonderful job advancing the agenda of Gnomeregan here, friend! And an amazing job of pretending you were only in it for the coin, simply splendid. But now Kelsey Steelspark could use more of your direct help.She's moved on yet again...she asked me to tell you to meet her far south, at Land's End Beach. I wouldn't keep her waiting, either!25062Gnomeregan previously learned that the Bilgewater goblins of the Horde survived a crash on an uncharted island near Kalimdor before arriving in Durotar. We initially came here to investigate what techniques and technology could possibly allow a hopeless pack of green-skinned imbeciles to survive such harsh conditions.While the goblins are at a loss, we still need to find out exactly what happened here. Search the beach for wreckage and belongings and bring anything that appears significant back to me.25063We need to obtain the object described in this journal, for certain. Extracting it from a chest would be a feasible matter, but the object itself sounds compromised, and unstable. Attempting to forcefully open the chest could be disastrous.Fortunately, we know where the key is...statistically speaking, at least. There's plenty of sea turtles at the east end of this beach. One of them may hold the key.25064Moraya has been lookin' for some help with tha raptors. Ya should talk to her on the other side of Darkspear Hold when ya get a chance.25065It's time to conclude this matter efficiently. From what we've determined, this mysterious object is in the possession of the \"smart\" brute described in the journal. We don't know exactly what's happened to this creature, obviously, so you should take caution.This... \"Meatface\" is hiding in the hills, near where these goblins bury their dead. Look for the graveyard and he should be just past it.25066This is ridiculous! Those gnomes just don't know when to stop!Goblin pride is on the line here! , you gotta jump into the Pride of Kezan and show them what's what!Let me know when you're ready!25067The rules are simple: Two men enter, one--wait. Sometimes there's women.Two people enter, one--Wait, no, sometimes it's more than two...and that means more than two come out--Alright, only rule is stay in the drome! There are no other rules!You're up against the biggest, baddest member of the Wastewander Bandits first. This'll either be a warmup or a bloodbath...it's up to you which!25068The creatures wandering these ruins are Earthen, the ancient ancestors of dwarves, made by the Titans to shape the world itself.The original Earthen broke down and went awry thousands of years ago, and these freshly uncovered ones seem no different. We may as well make use of these confused and unstable constructs.Enter the ruins and destroy the Earthen, and collect the jewels embedded in them; their magical energies will be both valuable and worthy of study.25069We are ready to enter the antechamber itself, . This is a momentous occasion.From the writings you've brought us, I believe these ruins were in fact once the grand entrance to Uldum itself. The quakes that ripped its doors open have probably collapsed the tunnels, but we may yet find amazing things hidden within.Search the ruins for anything intact that may be studied.  The thrill of discovery awaits!25070As you lay your hand upon the chest, a faint rumbling can be heard. The sound of grinding movement echoes behind you as the chest begins to shut itself.Something is approaching!25072We haven't just been camped here singin' songs with gnomes and playing with dangerous machinery, you know. My men have been trying to clear this hive out for a week now! Problem is, we've taken so many losses by now that the bugs have the advantage.Lucky for us, the bugs either don't like to eat goblins, or they like us so much they save us as treats, because nearly all my men are still cocooned up out there. I need you to go save 'em.25073You've be doin' quite well for one so young. I've no doubts you'll be makin' quite da name for yarself.Go now, northwest, across da shallows ta Sen'jin Village. Dere you'll be meetin' Master Gadrin. He'll likely have a task or two for ya before ya truly make ya way out into the Durotar wilds.Please remember, , we may disagree wit' the young Hellscream at times, but his intentions are noble, and it be very important that we remain united as one Horde. Make da Darkspear proud.25074Thanks in part to your efforts, we've stabilized the situation here. We need to turn our attention south, to Fort Triumph.Fort Triumph is the keystone of our operation in the Barrens - the vital land-link between Northwatch and Theramore.I'll pack up and head out separately. Report to Commander Roberts at the fortress and I will see you there soon. Together, we will secure the frontier!25075These bulky dwarven siege engines aren't cut out for the close-quarters fighting of the Battlescar.I've got some new designs I'd like to try out, but first I'm going to need some spare parts. There's plenty of wreckage sitting in the Battlescar. All I need is an enterprising  to haul it back for me.That's you, . I'm talking about you.25079Our shipments of saltpeter from Dustwallow have been held up, which means we can't manufacture our own gunpowder here.But I can retrofit our armaments to use goblin Blast-O powder. It's unstable, dangerous, toxic to the skin, and harmful if swallowed... but I think I can make it work!Get me a keg of the stuff by attacking one of those goblin sapper specialists who've been storming our walls.25080Okay! Using the spare parts you've found for me, I've got a framework roughed out for my versatile new assault vehicle. All I need now is a compact power supply.I've noticed that the indigenous wildlife here packs quite the punch, electrostatically speaking. Can you hunt down Thunderheads near the base here and get me an intact electrogizard? It might take a few kills to find a usable gland.25081The Horde has fought us to a standstill from their stronghold west of here. The fighting continues, even as the land breaks open under our feet.Someone's got to break the stalemate! I need you to venture into the Battlescar and help my men crush the Horde opposition there.In the center of the scar you will find a flag marker designating who controls the area. Scout out the flag. It'll be worth your while to claim the scar for the Alliance if someone hasn't already done so.25082Why high command decided that a silithid mound was the ideal place to build a fortress, I'll never know. Them lil' buggers are tunneling under our fortifications and setting back our timetables. We need to scorch 'em out!Take this here bucket of burning pitch and dump it on the silithid mounds right outside the main gate. They look like big piles of sand. Kill anything that comes out, but be careful,  - them nasties are likely to swarm you when you light those mounds up.25084A moment there, .We've got more problems here than just the end of the world as we know it. Our vigil here's threatened by the quilboar. We've been content to leave them be when they stay in the Kraul, sure, but every day they press further and further out towards our camp.Mahka, bless her green heart, wouldn't ever forgive me if I went out bashing heads in myself, but if you could help drive back those that're wandering near the camp, I'd appreciate it.25085Una here used to spend time in Camp Taurajo. She's told me about a quilboar that used to be captured there, named Mangletooth. Quite the clever one, for a quilboar.I've been tryin' to think what got these quilboar riled up so much recently, and it might be that Mangletooth escaped Taurajo alive. If he has, he's certainly calling the shots.There's a large hut up in the hills to the northwest. If you find Mangletooth there, cut 'im down.25086Can you do me a huge favor, ? My sister-in-law's uncle is in the Earthen Ring, and he's here in the Barrens studying the impact of the Cataclysm, down at Firestone Point. He says their camp is surrounded by quilboar and I worry that they might get overrun.Can you check in on Dorn Redearth for me? I'd hate for anything to happen to him, what with the close family bond and all.25087The Alliance owes a debt to the dwarves of Bael Modan, who built some of our earliest fortifications in the Barrens.Their commander, General Twinbraid, is a real stalwart. One of our best. He's on patrol south of here, keeping the Horde on their toes.I definitely want to keep him appraised of the situation here so we can coordinate our next move. Can you deliver this frontline report to him in the field?25089Darnell tells me that the two of you have already met.  That's good, because I'm sending you both into Deathknell.  Your work is done here.Speak with Deathguard Saltain in Deathknell, to the north.  He will tell you more of what you must know.25090Scourge have trickled into Tirisfal Glades and have infested this area.I need someone to beat back the rotting dead and ravaged corpses that have taken this small farm.  Scatter their bones and bring back their putrid claws.  The Deathguards will reward you.25091If you're looking for more work, I've got a line for you. I know an elf by the name of Trenton Lighthammer who's been obsessed with the sand trolls near here for years. He's dead-set on finding some kind of mythical sword made by them, and just a while ago he finally got a crew together to go to Sandsorrow Watch and look for it.Last I heard, they kicked the trolls out of one of their camps and set up shop there. Look for it to the west, near Zul'Farrak.25093These orcs were murdered in cold-blood by the Alliance down on the coast. We did nothing to provoke them.Their deaths should not be in vain, . Will you bring them justice?There are three SI:7 leaders down there along the beach. Bring me each of their heads.25094Splendidly done! But you'll be fighting more than mere humans!Your next opponent's a mean one...watch out for his right hook. And his left. I'd be wary of his fists in general.25095I hope you're ready for the next one, . One mistake could mean instant, painful death! But that's what the people pay to see, isn't it?I hope you're not afraid of bugs...25098True to his word, Thrall is going to get us going in the right direction to rescue our people. He asked to speak with you.Good luck, . We're all depending on you.25099Head back down to the coast and tell Kilag that I'd like for you to borrow Bastia. The panther knows the way to where your friends are being held captive.Go now. I will see you again before we make our move against the Trade Prince.25100Bastia will make sure that you get to where you need to go, goblin.25102Twinbraid's patrols always throw us right into the thick of danger. If it's not Horde ambushes, it's a quilboar hit-and-run.The problem is them lousy landquaker kodos. Big walkin' walls of fur, shakin' the ground... We can't see or hear an ambush creepin' up on our backside.Go scare 'em off from our patrol, here. Killing a few should drive the herd south and out of what's left of me hair.25103We've done a bang up job here. I'm gonna make sure these mooks finish properly and then head back to Gadgetzan for a bit.If you want to keep making a good impression on our Steamwheedle friends, or just make more money, you should head southwest of here. Bootlegger Outpost is set up on the edge of the gaping chasm.Talk to Zeke Bootscuff. I'd bet good money he'll need help.25104The patrol's been quiet today. And that's got me worried, .Ever since the Alliance sacked Taurajo, none of our positions are secure. You look like you can handle yourself - can you scout around for me?Check in with my son Marley outside the Bael Modan excavation, southeast of here. The site's exposed and susceptible to raids, and my son's too proud to signal for help if he needs it.25105Lila's pet Nibbler got into my workshop again!I was making a bracelet, to be delivered today.  The work was almost done, except for the gems.  I spent all night cutting them, but when I stepped out for a bit of breakfast, the little beast came into my workshop and swallowed every gem in sight!  The thing can digest ANYTHING, and trust me, you'd break your back trying to pick up its leavings.I need to get replacement gems fast; the courier is coming in tonight.  Help!25106Look at the chaos down there, ! I've instructed the foremen to save what artifacts they can. Who knows what treasures these tauren animals are like to make off with.Can you help get a handle on things? Kill the raiders and save what artifacts you can.While you're at it, look for my missing tools. A few quick repairs and I can get this flying machine up and running again.25107At the bottom of the chest, you find a large tablet. Made of a material resembling stone, but completely smooth and flawless, it is covered in strange writing.While some resembles the writing on the walls, other scripts appear completely different. Andoren would probably like to see this.25108Saddest story I ever heard told, . Feegly was one of our fastest diggers, until he got a hold of that - thing. \"The Tear of the Moons\" we called it. It changed him. Remade him. I wish it had stayed buried.Feegly was banished from Bael Modan but I've heard reports he's come sniffing around the dig site again. He's suffered enough, the wretched thing. If you find him down there, put ol' Feegly out of his misery.25109We barely escaped with our hides intact!The Trade Prince has a whole bunch of us enslaved and performing manual labor inside the cavern.Greely helped the seven of us to get out, but she was recaptured in the process., you're the only one crazy enough to walk into an exploding volcano! The assistant will be able to help you free the others.Hurry! This place is about to blow for good!25110Assistant Greely is clearly bewildered and intimidated. How will she help you to find a way to rescue everyone in this condition?Maybe if she were to drink one of those Kaja'Cola Zero-One drinks you saw, she'd be able to have a bright idea?25111Now that I know you're not squeamish, I've got another job for you. Have you seen the red-feathered birds swarming around the bones out there? Those are fire rocs. They'll light you up good if you're not careful.They're also pretty darn valuable thanks to their unique anatomy. Most of the hunters loafing around here aren't up to the task of killing fire-spitting buzzards for money... think you can handle it?25112I make my money around here selling animal parts. I've been perfecting a foolproof method of maximizing profit: The butcherbot!These little guys are programmed to harvest every scrap of usable material from the wildlife around here, on a case-by-case basis. He does all the work, and best of all, only I know how to get the goods back out of him.If you're interested in making some coin, take one of these guys for a spin. I need some glasshide basilisk parts; you'll find a bunch of them to the south.25115The hyenas wandering the wastes here might look scrawny, but they've got some of the strongest jaws you'll find! If you're not careful, they'll take a leg off in one bite. That kind of bone strength is a valuable resource, my friend, just waiting to find a buyer!Take one of my Butcherbots with you. Jaw separation isn't an easy task, and this little guy has been set up to know exactly what to do. Just bring him back when he's full.25118I don't know about you, but I'm not much a fan of spiders, much less the kind that come bigger than me. Loch Modan's a gorgeous place, but I'd say it could do without those horrid things waltzing around.Tell you what, I've got some spare coin, and you look like a tough one. If you head out and off some of those things for me, I'll pay you for your time.25120Okay, ! Let's take these artifacts to my father and give him our report firsthand.Thanks to your help my flying machine is ready to roll. We can fly there together and share in the glory.Talk to me when you're all set to move out!25121It looks like we've got more work to do! Having Mr. Noggenfogger ask us to take care of the rest of the pirates is a true honor.Since you've been SO helpful, why don't you meet me at Lost Rigger Cove? I've just got to slip into something a bit more comfortable, so don't wait on me. I'll beat you there, promise!25122You've got to get all the Kaja'Cola Zero-One that you can and make the goblins drink it to boost their morale and free them!25123This nightmare will never be over while Blastshadow the Brutemaster still breathes. There are a couple of problems though.One, being a warlock, he's got a succubus named Delicia Whipsnaps. If you kill Blastshadow quickly, the demon will go back to where it was summoned from.The second problem, since Blastshadow is a warlock, he has a soulstone that allows him to resurrect. You have to get his soulstone and destroy it so that he'll be dead forever!25125Okay, we have got to get out of here before she blows for good!Let's head out the other end of the tunnel on the north side of the mine. We should be able to use one of the mine carts for a quick ride down the side of the volcano.25126The first order of business will be to put a little strength in your backbone. I could send you out to the Barrens to hunt kodo, but well, in all honesty, you're more useful to us alive than dead.I believe you'll be of more use to us slaughtering the boars you'll find in the farms to the north and northeast of here.25127I must send you back into the fields again, . You will find large numbers of scorpids northwest of here. Bring me eight of their tails.The antidote for their sting is actually made from venom extracted from their stingers. We keep large quantities of antidote for scorpid venom on hand to heal young bloods just like you...But I'm sure you won't be needing any of that, will you?25128Hey mon, take a knee and hear me out.  We got a problem.A good friend of mine, Hana'zua, has gone out into the valley and he hasn't returned.  Last I seen, he was headin' north, where the scorpids hunt.  Maybe you go take a look for him?  The spirits be tellin' me that he's not well.25129! I thought I would die out here with none to know of it. While I was hunting the scorpids of the Valley, I came across a particularly vicious-looking one. Hurling myself at it, I managed to inflict a massive blow to its claw before it closed around my leg.I wasn't ready for its stinger though, and it sliced down and into my chest, cutting into my flesh and letting my blood. Please, you must kill the scorpid for me! My honor must be upheld! I fought it up on the plateau to the south.25130Seeing the deed you have done for me steels my heart. I cannot fall so easily!

Perhaps he can help me.25131I trust the Valley of Trials will teach you much, young .I was sent to the Valley to guide you, but I have discovered a growing taint here...One of the Burning Blade - a foul, demon-worshipping cult - has made camp here in the Valley of Trials.  He skulks in a cave to the north, and his vile familiars have spilled from its mouth to cause havoc.As your first task against the Burning Blade, I bid you, defeat these familiars. Slay many and, if you survive, return to me.25132Through my divinations, I see that an item of power - a medallion - hides deep within the Burning Blade Coven, guarded by beasts and black magic.

Can I count on you for another task?Some time ago I was surveying the cave to the north for minerals, and I left my favorite pick behind.  When I later returned to retrieve it I found the cave was filled with vicious beasts!  Will you go into the cave, the Burning Blade Coven, and get my pick?I left it in a chamber with waterfalls.  My pick has a spell on it so you can see it in the dark, so you won't have to worry about finding it... just what's guarding it!25136It sure gets hot out here in the Valley of Trials.If only I had some cactus apples, I could make my famous cactus apple surprise!

You saw the wreckage that it made of Tiragarde.  The devastation was even worse on the coast to the east of here.After the first wave, the beach was overtaken by angry elementals that came from the sea.  I sent grunts to take care of it, but the onslaught was too much.  I'm guessing you'll have a little more luck than they did.Beware the tides!25178 you tramp!

A Stonetalon native, he knows these roads better than his own hide. If we can wipe him out, resistance from the west might vanish.Find and kill Kona Thunderwalk, then report to Commander Singleton!25187The recent cataclysmic events have done more than wash a few boats onto our shore, .  The Southfury River has overflowed, and Durotar's entire western basin is now flooded.There are still people out there.  I've been searching for a while, but haven't been able to find anything.  Would you mind using my telescope and taking a look for yourself?25188My post is here on the tower, , and I cannot leave it.

As long as I refused to admit it, I recognize now: Kron is not returning from his crocolisk hunt.I've been working on a project... something that will memorialize Kron's passion for the hunt.  It's a crocolisk-tooth necklace... rows and rows of teeth, suitable to be worn by only the bravest young orc.  I will place it on his grave.Kron was brave, but he was not strong, like you.  Will you bring me the teeth for my necklace?25194Don' worry, Zen'Taji's not in any trouble.  He just been studyin' what happens when the river overflows.Ya see the big tall birds that stand on the riverbank?  Zen'Taji thinks they're in trouble.  The earthquake and the flood pushed the plainstriders over to this side of the water, but they can't fly back, and they're too scared to swim.They'll die if they stay here.  Zen'Taji doesn't like violence, but maybe YOU can attack them and scare them over to the other side.  Yes?25195Many creatures died when the water came rushin' into the valley.  The raptors, however, thrived.  They're clever predators, and they've been living off the misfortune of the other creatures.One of the raptors is particularly cruel.  He's killing the little animals and letting them rot in the water without even eating them!  He goes by the name of Screamslash, and if we're not careful, he could seriously disrupt the balance of nature.Travel north, slay him, and give his body back to nature.25196You should head north from here, .  Speak with Gor the Enforcer at the Dranosh'ar Blockade.  He's been placed in charge of securing shipping lanes for Orgrimmar, and Skull Rock sits right next to his precious dock.  I'm certain he'll be interested in picking up where we left off.25197What? You want to stay here to fight? Typical , wanting to stay and fight off the Horde while there's still a chance to run for it.Look, if you really want to save Northwatch, you should report to Admiral Aubrey in the tower behind me. He's keeping his ships here to fight, instead of ferrying us all away like I begged him to.Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to finish packing!25200That no-good Trade Prince Gallywix somehow managed to stow the whole Steamwheedle Sharks footbomb team away on the yacht.

After you do that, head to the platform control panel on the platform and set it to blow.25205My \"associate\" here has some plans for you that I don't agree with.  His actions are hasty, uncontrolled, and irresponsible, and you may end up paying for them with your life.Before you work with Gor, first listen to the tale that I have to tell.  It's a moralistic story - a fable - but I believe its lesson will prove valuable.  Speak to me when you are ready.25206Ignore the shaman, soldier.  Certain powers-that-be within the Horde demand that I keep him with me, but I assure you, that Thrall-loving farseer truly sees no farther than the borders of this hut.Elementals war against one another to the west of here.  I normally wouldn't mind, but I need that land clear to secure a broader shipping route to and from the Barrens.  The elementals are normally quite strong, but they are weakened by their attacks against one another.

Leave me, . Tell Silvia of what you've learned. Whatever is occuring in Dire Maul must be stopped.25209Within the High Wilderness to the south lay countless ancient ruins. It's there that the ancestors of the night elves fooled about with arcane magic, and it's there that the Gordunni ogres wander, searching for leftover scraps.You'll notice the forest is completely destroyed in that area; the ogres leave only useless muck in their wake, depriving the Horde of valuable resources.Go and slay the Gordunni there, . Secure the area for the Horde, and only for the Horde!25210A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass.The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers.25211Don't listen to Rharen. He's as addled as they come. It's his fault that the ale got captured!And what's more, I figure there's a bigger issue here than the ale being stolen. The fact that there's a bunch of orcs runnin' about Dun Algaz after all these years is ridiculous!Tell you what, . You head in there and be sure to drive as many orcs out of those ruins as you can. Dun Algaz isn't good for much anymore, but I'll be damned if we let them just sit in there.25213Sassy's over at the Slave Pits. She's there with the orcs getting ready to execute the final play on the Trade Prince., take the footbomb uniform up the road to the southwest and find her. I know she's going to want you to lead the charge!Ack, I'm starting to talk like the coach now!25214We really don't have time to rescue those that are incompetent enough to get themselves captured over and over. Still, since I have some extra rockets leftover, this problem should be a snap.Take these single-stage booster rockets down into the Slave Pits to the north and put them on the cages.The cage will lift off into orbit and those idiots will be freed.25215Predators will smell these dead naga from nearly a mile away. Soon we'll find ourselves fighting just to get in and out of the cave. Care to help me clean up?Just over the ridge to the south is Glimmerdeep Gorge. If you drag the corpses from the eastern exit of the cave over there to the gorge and cut them loose, the wildlife will pick them clean before they hit the sea floor. Just steer clear of the sharks as much as you can.25216If you're heading down the trench, I'd like you to check in one of our novice members for me.His name is Sam, but he's likely to embellish it a bit. He doesn't really understand how members of the Earthen Ring work, but he tries hard, so we try to give him the benefit of the doubt.Don't get too wrapped up in helping him with his crazy schemes. Just make sure he's still in one piece and let me know so that I can have a little peace of mind.25217Okay, I'll let you in on the real work, since you're looking at me so desperately.This rock is untapped! It's probably richer than a trade prince during a great war! I need samples. More samples. Samples from everywhere!I've modified my earth totems to drill through the sand and store samples of the rock underneath. Go find a nice spot and plant one.The shaking and rumbling will probably attract all the cute, curious wildlife, so maybe you can make some friends while you're at it.25218Fine! Fine. You argued me into it. You can help.I'm leaking air worse than a zeppelin stuffed with quilboar! My air valve must have come loose somewhere in the trench.I brought spare air balloons - make yourself useful and go fill one up, will ya? And find my valve! I'll need that too.I bet the crabs snatched it up... pinchy, greedy little things.25219I'm researching snails.Yes. Snails. When you're done laughing, maybe you can help.I'm sure you noticed the gigantic shellfish across the ridge... well, I'm pretty sure there's something inside it. It has several points that can only be mouths or entrances of some kind, and I've seen those sifting snails squeezing in and out.I'm thinking that we might be able to use the snails to gain entrance ourselves. That's the theory anyway.25220Been attacked by any of the eels along the ridges yet? If not, you will. They are vicious, bloodthirsty little monsters. They don't seem to show much of any preference in what they're biting.If you're going out into the valley, I'd appreciate if you thinned their population a bit. Not everyone here is as well equipped as you - we might not come back with just scratches.25221They're getting away!These are the same naga that attacked the boats and carried away our friends. We cannot let them escape!Take these spears and run them down with that seahorse of yours... don't waste your time dismounting, just keep after them and kill all that you can with the spears.I will try to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. Meet me at the far end of the ledge when you're done.25222Most of the other Earthen Ring that escaped the massacre on the boats have taken shelter in a cave a short swim down from the ridge. It's tucked midway up a huge rock formation, west of Nespirah, the gigantic shell on the horizon.  I need you to make sure they're okay. There's no telling how many naga might have attacked them as well.I'm going to hunt down that Fathom-Lord. I'll send word if I find the rock he's hiding under.25223I'd love to say that with the tides turning against us in Hyjal, every recruit helps our cause and so on... but to be perfectly blunt, most of you are nothing but a burden.If I had a copper for every peasant who got too scared when the cataclysm hit and now wishes to join our side... well, let's just say I'd be a rich woman.Fortunately we have checks in place to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Go and prove yourself to the fiery instructors below.  Hopefully you'll do better than the others.25224It is customary for new recruits to be sent on a difficult or sometimes impossible task.

I was staring into those deep brown eyes of his.25230We've found a brood of dragon whelps gathered off the road to the north, and they show the same illness as the stags.Green dragons are not simple beasts of nature, but the very guardians of the wild.

Slay the infected whelps, , and return to me.25232I've been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents here in Durotar.  To the northeast, you'll find a cave where the organization trains their new recruits.  I'm interested in what exactly they are teaching these neophytes.I only tell you this because you seem to be looking for work.  If you're interested in a little coin, sack the cave and return with their spellscrolls.The cave is somewhat hidden: exit Razor Hill from the east, and follow the canyon's eastern ridge.25233Cho'gall's Twilight Proveditors swear a blood oath that they will get their supplies through to the front, pledging a pound of their own considerable flesh for every pound of supplies they fail to deliver. They would rather die than fail.See to it that they do both.25234Prisoners of the Twilight's Hammer are forced to lug around sundries for the war effort, like common pack animals. I want those supplies, and if we can free a few poor souls from the Hammer's shadowy grip, all the better.Kill the slave drivers along the road to our south and nearby slaves should make a break for it.Search the packs they leave behind for anything valuable, and destroy anything you can't carry.25235Hail, . Care to lend a hand for the people of Darkshire?There's a huge ogre mound just down the hill there. The Splinter Fist ogres usually keep to themselves, but they've got a bad habit of attacking travelers. Just the other day I saw one drag off a poor man's horse for food... he was lucky it left him behind!The Night Watch wants to only risk its few members in the defense of more immediate threats, me included. But if you kill some of those ogres for me, I'll pay you for your deed.25236Our army needs water, and luckily the elements gave us plenty of that when the cataclysm hit.  The water that filled up the canyon to the southwest should do the trick.Unfortunately, the corpses of thunder lizards still sit at the bottom of the canyon, and their electrical discharges are a bit too dangerous.  I've got grunts that can lift them out of the water, but we need someone agile enough to attach the other end of the rope.  Are you my , ?25237As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems.Weeks ago, in the glade to the west, I saw the mountain giants distraught.

You know up until you \"dealt\" with Chip, she was dating him. Now she's going out with the Trade Prince!I just can't get over the fact that she betrayed you like that with your ex.

They're a war machine - a swarm of locusts moving up the mountain, devouring anything in their way.The parts of the forest they're not setting ablaze are being scoured of life in order to feed the mortal cultists.We've got to put a stop to the hunters canvassing Wolf's Run, not only to preserve what wildlife remains but to force the cult to march on empty stomachs. Look south of here, as well as up the road to the east.25256You, , stop a minute.My boss Spiketooth sent me to look for help and supplies.  You don't appear to be a merchant, but you can probably still help him out.  He's just to the southeast of here, next to the crashed cart.  Oh, and tell him I sent you... I want to make sure that he knows I'm not just slacking off over here.25257I own a couple gladiators that I put into competitions around Kalimdor.  You can see most of them chained up around here... we were lucky to rein these ones in after the cart broke down.Ghislania, that naga over there... she's lost her last three fights.  She could use a tune-up, or maybe just a little bit of thrashing.  Go challenge her, I'll bet even YOU are stronger than she is.25258Griswold, chained up over there on the cliffs, is my newest gladiator.  We found him just south of here, sniffing around with Northwatch soldiers.  I had my men nab him up, and now he works for me.He looks tough enough, but he hasn't really been battle-tested yet.  Go pick a fight with him so I can see if he's worth keeping around.25259I wouldn't normally keep a taunka as a captive, due to their close relationship with the Horde... but this one is a traitor, and a criminal to boot.  Exiled by his own tribe, he canoed down to Azshara and was found stealing supplies from Valormok.  He would have been put to the axe had I not been standing by, wallet in hand.Gaur is my winningest gladiator, .  I'll bet you 10 silver that you can't beat him.25260The flood to the southwest wiped out one of the few Burning Blade camps that still pockmark Durotar.  This one was led by a goblin named Fizzle Darkclaw, and believe me, we're better off without him.Darkclaw, however, did possess an orb that the Horde is interested in procuring.  Who knows why... I leave that to the warlocks.  All I know is that I need that orb.25261One of our more useful shaman, Margoz, knows more of the Burning Blade's corruption.  He speaks of a cave called Skull Rock in the mountains, just outside Orgrimmar, that shelters a large band of Burning Blade cultists.Before you go to Skull Rock, speak with Margoz.  He is wise and his council is valued.He is camped to the southeast, between the coast and Drygulch Ravine.Follow his advice, but whatever Margoz says, , I still want you to crush those cultists!25262.  The Burning Blade has infested the cave east of Orgrimmar known as Skull Rock.  Inside that cave they perform vile rituals, and burn their own flesh with Searing Collars.By wearing these collars, I believe the cultists attune themselves to demonic power.  But to confirm this, I must have a collection of the collars to study.Go to Skull Rock and gather Searing Collars from the cultists you find there.  Bring them to me, and I will uncover their secrets.25263The Searing Collars you brought me are powerful demonic implements.  Divining their origin is, I'm afraid, beyond my skills as a shaman.  We will need a warlock to study them.Take a searing collar to Neeru Fireblade.  Although he is a skilled warlock, he professes to use his powers to thwart demons, and claims his research in the occult is benign.  Be that true or false, we may need his aid against the demonic cult in Durotar.You may find Neeru in Orgrimmar in the Cleft of Shadow.25264Since the last great war when the Burning Legion was defeated, I have searched for sources of demonic corruption in orc society.  The collar you brought me confirms my fears.It belongs to the Burning Blade.Your role in this tale is nearly complete, .

Can you fly down there and find him? I've got a bad feeling that Goldrinn's shrine is in trouble...25269Have you heard of Lo'Gosh, the wolf ancient? In the Alliance tongue, he is known as \"Goldrinn.\"I don't need to tell you how important the wolf god has been to the Horde - his tenacity under adversity has been an inspiration to all of our disparate races.Southwest of here, down in the valley, lies a shrine to Goldrinn. My friend Takrik Ragehowl was refurbishing the shrine when I stopped hearing from him. I fear the worst.Please find Takrik and make sure the shrine is okay!25270The shrine has been taken, . We need the tenacity of Lo'Gosh now more than ever.These defilers - the lice-ridden wolf-men running rampant over the shrine - dishonor the memory of the wolf god. They arrived with the Twilight's Hammer, howling with their own twisted religion. They seek to corrupt noble Lo'Gosh to fit their own warped pantheon.Kill them! Kill them and bring me the tools of their worship, a kind of polluted incense. I must understand what they want with the shrine...25271The beasts you see here, they're no longer my brothers from Gilneas. They've been corrupted by some kind of madness, and they've taken over the shrine.They came when the Twilight's Hammer arrived in Hyjal, and they howl the name of some blasphemous mockery of our beloved Goldrinn. Forget about me - destroy these vandals before they continue to defile the shrine.As you destroy them, look for the incense they carry and bring me some samples.25272The actions of these feral dogs are beginning to make sense. The Twilight's Hammer fears the power of the ancients. They do not want Lo'Gosh to return.So they've summoned their own wolf god - a perversion of what once was. \"Lycanthoth,\" the corruptor., Lycanthoth is but a shadow of Lo'Gosh's power, but the beast must be destroyed so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense, and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay the monstrosity and free the spirit of Lo'Gosh!25273I think I understand what's happening here. The Twilight's Hammer fears that the ancients may someday rise up to oppose them. They'll do anything to stop the return of Goldrinn.This \"Lycanthoth\" is a twisted version of our beloved wolf god, summoned by the Twilight's Hammer to replace him.Bah! It is but a shadow of Goldrinn's power. , kill this beast so that the true ancient can return. Take this incense and burn it in the Maw of Lycanthoth east of here. Slay that beast and free Goldrinn!25274You're here at last, .  Just in time as well.News of Ragnaros' emergence has spurred a large wave of recruits to seek membership in the Twilight's Hammer.If you're to infiltrate the cult, the time is now.  We will need recruitment papers -- signed in blood by a referring Twilight member.

But first we've got to secure this valley. South of here, a group of ogres led by Gar'gol has set up camp in a stinking hovel.I wouldn't characterize Gar'gol as a 'threat' so much as an enormous fleshy obstacle thrown into our path to distract us from the real danger. Nonetheless, he and his goons will have to be dealt with.Kill Gar'gol's minions in Goldrinn's name!25279Yes, . I am Goldrinn, the one called \"Lo'Gosh\" in your tongue.

Here?This is far more serious than I expected. We've got to put a stop to this. I don't know if I'm ready to lead such an offensive, but I'm not about to let my fears get in the way of what needs to be done!I will rally our forces from Feathermoon Stronghold. Head to Dire Maul, make your way to the arena, and disrupt Cho'gall's activities; we will launch our attack during the confusion.25334Can ya feel how angry the elements be?

Let yaself get lost in da flames... let ya spirit peer into the true threat.25336Master Uzer'i's taught me in the ways of making spirit weapons of great power. I'll help you set on the path to make some, and you'll give me the chance to practice my craft.This vessel can shrink and trap a defeated creature inside of it. We'll need the muisek of beasts first; ironfur bears and longtooth wolves. Kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them before their spirits can escape.25337The next step is hippogryphs.As Master Uzer'i always said, hippogryphs have been loyal companions to the night elves for many years, an' their spirits are loyal and steadfast.I don't think they'll miss a few, and I don't care if they do. We need the muisek of 10 frayfeather hippogyphs in the wilderness to the south.25338The wandering forest walkers that can be found meandering through the forest are our next target, . Night elves have enlisted treants as allies to fight against the horde. Their movement may be slow, but their role as protectors is undeniable.Soon we will be able to use this power for our own benefit.Find three wandering forest walkers; kill them, and use the muisek vessel to shrink and capture them.25339In my day, I was a seasoned hunter. There wasn't any creature around that I feared. Until...I was out in the forest, sharpening my blade after a tough battle, when I was ambushed. Harpies surrounded me, and I barely managed to drag myself to safety.Even now, I can still hear their cries echoing...I was never the same after that. But the hate boils inside of me -- I must get even, after all these years.The Northspring harpies can be found to the west of here. , get my revenge.25340Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. She is pure evil; I have heard that her heart is one of crystal. She is void of any emotion aside from the hate she feels towards all others. You must face Edana and bring me back her dark heart.I have heard of a horn that harpies carry -- blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon the queen.Imagine her surprise when it is not her kin calling her, but her death.25341While you're down there cracking skulls...I've gotten reports that make me think these ogres may be more than the usual lumbering threat. The Warlocks among them have been seen carrying orbs, possibly items of empowerment.It would be easy to dismiss them as crude trinkets, but I need to make sure we're not surprised. Bring me back one of these orbs.25342We're lucky and unlucky here, grunt. Lucky that I had you bother to bring this back, and unlucky that my suspicions turned out to hold water. This thing's full of corrupted stench.It's far too new to be something fished out of the ruins, either. Someone is supplying these ogres, and we need to know who before this becomes a situation.Get that filthy thing upstairs to Swar'jan, the warlock on top of the guard tower. He's good for a few ideas; I'd listen to his suggestions, if I were you.25344There's no way the Gordunni made these. They're being supplied. Someone is giving them gifts of power, and we need to find out who.The upper-class Gordok that guard Dire Maul will know more about this. Orhan is no doubt having you thin their numbers, but I'll need one alive.Take the orb back. It's similar to a Soulstone, so I've made some...adjustments. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here.25345, next I must have you capture a creature that in appearance, may look quite fragile, yet its powerful spirit is what we are truly after. The faerie dragons that I speak of have served the night elves as their allies. We must capture one so that the horde may benefit from this strength of spirit as well.Here is the muisek, . Kill 8 sprite darters or sprite dragons, and capture their muisek. They may be found to the west of here.25346The mountain giants left the mountains to aid the night elves when the Burning Legion appeared in the world. You will know them by their massive size and the way the ground begins to shake as you travel along their rocky terrain.I am eager to harness power of that size. Kill 7 mountain giants, then use the muisek vessel to capture their powerful muisek.25349I have heard of your battle against the corrupted dragons, , and I thank you for your courage... but I have disturbing news.The dryads of the forest, though allies of the Night Elves, have always passed us by in peace.

Please, put a stop to these twisted dryads.25350If you have a moment, ...One of the students I was teaching has gone to explore the darkmist ruins to the south by himself. I warned him that it was too dangerous, but he was too excited to listen.  I had spoken with him earlier about an amulet that is concealed within those ruins.  Now, I fear that he may have run off in search of it, because of me...Estulan has forbidden us to pursue him. If you go there, could you please look for him?25352Wonderful work in the hovel, .

The Grimtotem are not to be trifled with or underestimated. Go back and slay them; let the rivers in Feralas run red with their dark blood.25363The gnolls... they are more than a nuisance.  They are a constant threat to the existence of this very camp!  It is irrelevant whether they are indigenous to Feralas or not; if we do not strengthen our resolve against them, we will find ourselves driven out of the entire region.The gnoll attacks against the camp have become more fevered as of late.  We need your aid in thinning their numbers; bring to me ten of their manes, and I will reward you handsomely for your effort.Go!25364Gnolls are unfortunately as resilient as they are brutish and stupid. I have driven back the gnolls time after time from our camp, and it is only our chieftain's mercy that prevents them from being wiped out entirely.Over the years, it has fallen into a dance of strength and dominance. When their numbers surge and they threaten the camp, the alphas, the strongest gnolls, must be slain.This will drive them back into the forest, and leave us is peace until they forget their lessons.25365Gnolls aren't the sharpest tools in the shed, but they will no doubt have some sort of documented strategy on their recent activity.  If we were to find those plans, then we'd have a clearer idea of what is making them so worked up.I want you to head back to the Woodpaw and find anything that might resemble their battle plans.  They have to have something; their attacks have been too coordinated to be done without them.  Find them, and return to me when you have them.25366With the battle plans of the gnolls discovered, all that now remains is to bring the plans back to Hadoken Swiftstrider in Camp Mojache.  Perhaps he or someone there can make further sense of what the gnolls are up to.25367From what scouting we have managed to muster, we believe that the foe south of the gnolls is an insect-like race.  Frankly, it is irrelevant whether or not they're sentient.  If they are driving the gnolls to frenzy against us, then they are as big of a threat - if not more - than the gnolls.Dive deep into where these Zukk'ash insects dwell; it is known as the Writhing Deep.  Thin their numbers and report back to me what you find, bringing back their carapaces as evidence of your handiwork.25368The other spirits and I are bound here by a cruel demon named Verinias. He is our captor, a twisted, mindless beast who devours our souls over milennia.The lure of the souls and arcane magic you've brought me should let you draw him out. Take this condensed essence to the dead tree at the far north of the ruins. Use it to lure Verinias and slay him, that I may finally be free...25369In surveying the Writhing Deep, one of our scouts reported seeing a giant insect - much larger than the other insects spotted - wandering about the twisted terrain.  Not only is it larger, it also seems to secrete some sort of aura that the other insects don't.  We've given it a name - Stinglasher.The innards of this beast would be invaluable to study as we figure out the best way to deal with this new threat.  Cut out its secretion glands and bring it back to me immediately!25370This is no mere natural occurrence, .  There must be a twilight presence behind our lines that we haven't accounted for.It's possible that whoever is instigating the elemental disturbance is using foul magic to hide themselves from our sight.Seek the aid of the faerie dragons that roam near the World Tree; they can see through any of our enemy's illusions.Feed them the juniper berries that grow nearby to gain their trust.25371If you are going to be making it anywhere in this kelp forest, we need to get you a reliable mount. I think I've come up with a better plan than the sea turtle, and it's not far.Tie off a lure at the rope just west of us, and then mount the seahorse that it will attract.Be warned, you may need to work hard to break the beast.25372This is the Heart of the Forest.

New life will bloom from the ashes of old.Thank you, . My time is done.25373I am proud of Mojache's reputation as a safe haven in the wilds of Feralas, but the camp faces many threats. The Gordunni ogres gather nearby in the northern foothills, claiming their territory and despoiling the wildlife.With the arrival of our brothers and sisters seeking shelter, I cannot let them linger any more. Go north and drive the ogres out.25374You may have seen this with your own eyes, but my longrunners have reported something disturbing to me. The gordunni in the hills have captured an enormous sasquatch from the wilds.I don't know how long it's been held, but ogres are not ones for hobbies. I fear they plan to unleash the tortured beast on Camp Mojache.Return to the deepest corner of the Gordunni Outpost and slay the sasquatch, .25375The gordunni are not known to tame animals. If they're learning, this is cause for alarm. While the sasquatch they've tamed may be the major threat to our camp, the gordunni who captured him should be dealt with as well. If left, they may simply capture another.Kill the gordunni tamers, and make sure the ogres know their efforts will not be tolerated!25377It is unclear what manner of creature scrawled the seemingly random markings on this piece of parchment, but upon close inspection, some of the obscure shapes begin to look like landmarks.Scanning the sea floor, you think you recognize a few points of reference, one being a nearby sunken ship. If your guess is correct, there appears to be treasure of some kind near the wreck.You cannot help but wonder what the scaly, serpentine figure on the map might represent....25378The dragons of nature... Heed her call, . Do not linger here. Her request for your aid is both a great honor and an omen of terrible danger.The place she spoke of is called the Emerald Summit.

The fire elementals unleashed here are unlike any I've ever encountered.Can you help us stem the tide of destruction? Slay the raging firestorms... before they engulf Aessina's Grove and erase all hope of someday reclaiming this mountain!25382The firestorms up ahead are unbound elementals in the purest form - something I didn't think could exist outside their own plane. Only very skilled summoners could unleash something like this., head into the Inferno and seek out Twilight Inferno Lords. They've got to be summoning in reinforcements as we speak. Silence them... For good!25383With that, I am the only one left.Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals.You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands.25384Thank you, . We owe you our lives.But if we're ever to see the surface again, we'll have to fight our way out of here. That means I'm going to need to craft some weapons and armor.Before you found me, I saw a soldier eaten by one of those orca up there.I'll wager that if you cut a few of them open, you'll find plenty of scrap metal for me to work with.If you don't want to swim up to them, I bet you could lure one down to you with some entrails...25385Help us, !

With the Twilight's Hammer shamed and the Gordunni left bleeding and broken, we'll be able to set our sights on the true battle with the Alliance here.It'll take time to build our forces enough to match the night elves infesting this place.

For Khaz Modan!25396As you witnessed, the dragon Ysondre has told us that the tears of the land can seal the portal from which this corruption stems.Her words ring true; in the glade to the west, I have seen the mountain giants distraught. They raged in frustration and wept, and their tears fell upon the stones as shining crystals.Though the giants weep no more, these stonetears must be what Ysondre referred to. We must gather them.25397The cliff giants of Feralas are extensions of the earth itself, .

Show them no mercy!25400Estulan, the Highborne up in the tower, is reclusive. I haven't been able to speak to him very much. He has, however, told me that the ruins of the High Wilderness to the south are full of Gordunni ogres.The ogres are not only a threat, they're destroying any forest and wildlife nearby. Estulan has also warned me of what might happen if they discover any artifacts of Highborne power among the ruins...Head south, , and slay any Gordunni you find!25401In addition to clearing out the ogres...Estulan mentioned something else about the ogres. He said the ogre warlocks may have some sort of orb, or other item of powerHe was terse about it, but seemed upset...he said there was \"no way they could be Highborne\", so I think he wants to know just where they got them. Bring me back one of these orbs.25402He's right. I haven't been among the night elves long, but I can tell these markings are completely unlike any kaldorei decorations...Estulan needs to see this. Take this up the tower to him. He may be surly, but don't be dissuaded; once he sees the orb, he'll realize it's an important issue.25403This is neither a crude ogre trinket, nor an ancient relic made by my kind. Its specific construction is new to me...and this fact disturbs me greatly.The wolf-girl will be sending you to Dire Maul soon, to fight the Gordok elite. They are the leaders of the Gordunni, and would know who is supplying these.Take the orb back, I've cast a few enchantments on it. Hold it up in front of a weakened Gordok ogre, and once you've captured him, bring it back here.25404South of here you'll find a solitary tower, known as \"Blackhorn's Penance.\" Upon it is bound a demon: Tyrus Blackhorn.You may think me mad for turning to an old foe for help, but Blackhorn was once a mortal, and I can't imagine he wants to watch Twilight's Hammer triumph.Speak with Blackhorn, and see if you can convince him to help us in our fight. He may yet redeem himself....Just don't set him free!25405You have done well, , but there is much more to do and I grow weary.I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to Earthen Ring leadership, pleading for their help.I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here.Speak to the leader of the men you've saved and do what you can to help them prepare for battle.The naga are scouring the waters for us. It is but a matter of time before they return - and they will surely come in even greater force.25406With the nearby ogres dealt with, we should take the offensive and press our attack into their territory.The Gordok ogres are the head of the Gordunni clan, ruling them from the ruins now called Dire Maul. They are stronger than the lesser Gordunni, but I have no doubt you can handle them, . They won't know what hit them.25407The Sentinels make up the bulk of our forces here, but a well-rounded night elf army requires more than just night elves. The creatures of this forest, our ancestral home, have protected us for centuries. We simply need to rally them.Take this whistle. Our allies know this sound, and you'll be using it to recall them.Before you start gathering creatures, I'd like you to recall a few of our wisps, just for practice. You can find them just outside the fortress, among the trees.25408We will decimate the Twilight's Hammer by corrupting and subverting them.

I need you to harvest some bileberries from the wailing weeds that surround this tower.My little pets will attempt to harvest YOU in return. Try not to let them agitate one another.25409Hippogryphs are majestic creatures. Some say they were created by Cenarius himself as a gift for the night elves. They're wary of other races, but they're intelligent enough to recognize a friend of a friend.I need more hippogryphs here so we can begin training some of our newer archers to ride them. Take the whistle again and rally the Frayfeather hippogyphs in the grove just south of the Tower of Estulan.25410Some people think treants are good for little more than fetching drinks in a war. Most of them haven't seen an entire defensive line scattered by what they thought was cover.And have you ever seen a peon try to chop one down and get surprised?

Be on the lookout for the Horde!25411The potion you created is vile enough to wake the dead. Which is its intended purpose.Slay a Twilight Inferno Lord and force the brew down his throat.

I can barely maintain this shape.I could help you, but please, help me pull myself together first. Once I'm more focused on this plane, I should be able to do it...If I could just leave this tomb, the soil itself outside is full of ancient arcane deposits, laying forgotten for centuries. Could you bring me some?25423You must be careful when you venture forth. Other spirits are bound to this place, malevolvent and hateful ones.

Please, gather the essence of the spirits, and bring it back to me.25424I thank you for freeing me, .  I will tell our allies of my findings.I suggest that you return to the emerald dragon that sent you.The Twilight's Hammer does not just seek to gain territory with this particular attack.  They're also after a prisoner.Fandral Staghelm is being held in the Barrow Dens.  The attack doubles as a distraction to free him.  To what end, I cannot tell.  Perhaps our dragon ally can shed some light on this.25426The first of Shandris's direct orders is to deal with the Woodpaw gnolls here. They've been spreading too far, too fast, and are becoming a threat to both the forest and our war effort.They know we're here. After we took this camp, we've been leading covert strikes against them. It's time to make a major blow; bring back ten of their manes, and we'll be ready for the next phase.25427Never underestimate a threat. These gnolls may seem like simple brutes, but there's animal cunning even among them.The gnolls run as a pack, and every pack has Alphas: The biggest, strongest, and most ruthless members that claw their way to dominance. They're the ones giving orders, so they're the ones we're going to slay now.They reside mostly around the Woodpaw Den, pushing the others around. Get out there and push harder.25428Now you will use our newfound knowledge to pull Thol'embaar into the mortal plane like a babe screaming from the womb. Then you will crush him.The ritual is simple: take this charred branch, tap it on the ground three times, and utter his name aloud.You must call him from within the heart of the Inferno. Destroy him, and bring his black heart back to me.25429With the gnolls out of the way, we're ready to take care of other foes. Our scouts have discovered what appears to be a hive nearby, extending deep beneath the ground.The insects of the hive are large and ferocious, and most likely pose an even greater threat than the gnolls. I want you to proceed to the hive with caution. Cut down a good portion of the bugs and bring back their carapaces for further study.25430The druids of Hyjal are not the only ones sworn to defend this land.  The emerald dragons have once again become a powerful ally to our cause.Speak to Alysra at the Ruins of Lar'donir, to the north, and see what you can do to help.25431Most of the insects we've seen wandering the hive have been enormous enough, but my scouts reported an especially huge one. It's supposedly a massive wasp, and it seemed to be directing the workers on the surface.I don't know much about these things, but if they're starting to wander beyond that pit in the ground, we need to put a stop to it. Kill this giant wasp and return to me.25432We dealt the Gordunni ogres a large blow at Dire Maul, but we haven't quite finished the job. My scouts have reported a group of them amassed in the hills to the north, gathering for some reason.It's possible they're interested in the Horde settlement nearby, but I don't want to take any chances. Scout the area, kill any ogres you come across, and report back.25433You may have seen it yourself, but other scouts have discovered an enormous beast being held by the ogres. Reports say it looks like a sasquatch, but if it is, it's the biggest ever seen in Feralas.The ogres are most likely trying to teach it to obey them. While that's almost comical, I'm not going to sit by and let them train that thing to roll over at their command. Return to the hills and slay it.25434The sasquatch may be a larger threat, but we also need to wipe out the ogres. The Gordunni have been a nuisance to us for too long, and Lady Shandris wants them completely gone.  Let's hope these are the last ones.Kill the Gordunni tamers that keep the beast chained, and make sure they know the price of their meddling.25436Something truly disturbing has occured. While on patrol, several of my scouts were ambushed by dryads.The dryads are close allies of the night elves and guardians of the forest. I assumed they were just frightened by the sight of worgen, but the sentinels I sent out afterwards were also attacked.Whatever is going on, I don't like it. I want you to go investigate as well. If even the dryads have been corrupted...put them to the sword.25437A dragon of the emerald dream... what have you gotten yourself involved in, ?I wouldn't keep her waiting if I were you. The place she spoke of is what we call the Emerald Summit. A path off the main road through the Lower Wilds leads up one of the high stone plateaus; there's a small shrine at the top.Good luck, . I hope to see you back safe.25438With that, I am the only one left.Even if I choose to remain in this world, I cannot rejoin the green flight. But this victory gives me hope. Perhaps, in time, I can find peace in a simple life among mortals.You must return to your people. Tell them that the dragons of nightmare are gone, and will no longer threaten these lands.25439These are the naga that took our people. I only need one to interrogate, kill the rest.Show no mercy, , for they would surely show us none.25440The Fathom-Lord is here, at the far side of the ruins. He's still injured from our last battle.I'll leave this pleasure to you. Make sure he doesn't get away this time.25441I have no fondness for snakes, and even less so down here. Fortunately for us, the watery elements still bend to my will for now.Take these globes and throw them at the ground to send the nearby water into a vortex, pulling in all the nearby serpents. The naga will most certainly turn the snakes against us, so keep the orbs close at hand.25442This pearl is unlike anything you've ever seen before. It radiates light, and if you are not mistaken, it radiates powerful magic as well.Earthmender Duarn back in Silver Tide Hollow will surely be interested in this.25447A severe illness has fallen over the creatures of this forest. While at first I hoped it was part of nature's course, it has refused to pass.The forest stags, normally strong and serene, have suffered the worst. Some waste away in weakness; others froth and rage dangerously. If I am to consult the spirits to learn more of this sickness, I will need the stags' antlers.25448My duty here is to watch over Telaron. Even without his meditation leaving him vulnerable, there's enough threats in this forest to keep both of us on our toes.That's why it maddens me so much that I don't have the opportunity to leave camp. More harpies than I've ever seen infest the northwest...foul creatures, spreading their filth across the ancient ruins uncaringly.They're a threat to this camp, and have no place in these lands. I'll pay you well if you get rid of them.25449My philosophy on leatherworking is that the work must be the best quality possible - no compromises. Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter is trying to sell you ocean-front property in Dun Morogh!In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have run across thick yeti hides. The Yeti are native to Feralas, with many found in Rage Scar Hold to the northeast. I want some, and I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that sounds fair, then we're in business.25450It's funny how things change. The northern yetis used to yield the best hides, but these...there's been a decline in quality, it seems. Maybe something nearby is making them sick.Luckily, the Feral Scar yetis to the southeast have flourished. I bet their hides are even better than they used to be!I would reward you handsomely for a stack of ten of their hides; bring them to me here, and we'll finish our business.25451You have found a pristine yeti hide that is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar.Considering that Pratt McGrubben at the Feathermoon Stronghold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him.25452I take pride in my leather work, and I feel it shows; quality should never be compromised.  Anyone who says that quality doesn't matter would also have you believe that the earth does not keep secrets!In my latest pursuit of high-quality materials, I have discovered thick yeti hides.  Yetis are native to Feralas, often found north of here in Rage Scar Hold.  I'll give you a choice of one of my leather goods for a stack of ten.  If that is agreeable to you, then we are set!25453I'm a bit confused. The Rage Scar yeti used to be the finest source of leather in these lands... but these pelts are weak and even rotted in spots. Some sort of illness must be plaguing the creatures.I'll have to rely on a different source. The yeti of Feral Scar Vale to the south have hides nearly as strong. They are also a great deal fiercer; do not hunt them without caution, .25454You have found what may very well be a perfect yeti hide.  You easily note that it is exceptionally thick and sturdy - more so than even the ones you've seen from the yeti in Rage Scar.Considering that Jangdor Swiftstrider at Stonemaul Hold is in the market for yeti hides, this particular one may be of considerable interest to him.25456Yeah yeah, I'm sure Felora wants you back. That woman has no respect for innovation. When I told her about the modifications I was making for my Earth Elemental, she nearly threw a fit.Go tell her everything's all well and dandy. And tell her she's not getting a share of my inevitable fortune either.She probably likes sleeping on the rock anyway.25458The leader of these forces must fall! The naga's offensive will be broken with no one to command them.I saw the coward retreat into one of the abandoned buildings here. Cut your way through the others and take his head! Lady Shandris will want to see it for herself.25459If there's one thing I can't stand, it's snakes. Any kind of snake - doesn't matter.While I was out searching for salvage, I saw a nest of sea serpents surrounding the nearby wreckage.I simply can't relax knowing that those awful creatures could slither up in here at any moment.Please, ! Do something about them!25460The effects of the Twilight's Hammer attack can be felt even here, this close to the world tree.As our forests burn, the very earth turns against us in a crazed frenzy.We can't allow the elementals to go unchecked.  Go and help our men take care of them.25462Do not fear the bears in this grove,  - I have pacified them for the moment.My concern at present is for the welfare of the bear cubs. The fires drove the little ones up the trees, where they've gotten stuck. We've got to get those bears safely to the ground!Flying creatures frighten them, so you'll have to climb the trees yourself. Look for footholds at the trunks. Climb the trees, grab the bear cubs, and toss them - GENTLY! - onto the target here.Nothing can go wrong with this plan.25463A Highborne mage named Estulan, estranged from his surviving brothers, has built a tower to the east where he trains young night elves in arcane magic.Were it not for Lady Tyrande's recent mercy towards his kind, his execution would be my duty under the law. He will be watched closely, but I will not deny aid to my Sentinels simply out of pride.I've sent Silvia ahead to the Tower of Estulan to begin an offensive against the ogres infesting the nearby forest. Report to her for further orders.25464Ragnaros is not the only powerful elemental that has re-emerged into our world.The dreaded Baron Geddon is leading the onslaught and we must put an end to this rampage.The Flameseer's Staff has proven powerful.  Perhaps it is powerful enough to weaken him to the point where our arch druids can bind him where he stands.Go,  and be careful.  Baron Geddon is a vengeful and treacherous being.25465Hey pal! I'm still working on a variant of a gnomish shrinking ray, using superior GOBLIN technological advances in its construction!  In an effort to avoid inconveniences for myself such as death, I'd like for you to try it out on some of the sea giants along the coast here.  You should find miniaturization residue on them after you shrink them - bring me back some!25466If I bet against my own better judgment and stay to run an engineering shop along the Forgotten Coast, I will need to deal with these pesky elementals.  Curse the powers of elementalism unchecked, I say!Fortunately for me, and now for you my hopeful agent provocateur, the elementals represent an ideal source of raw power for my Ultra-Shrinker refinement - give them the what-for I say!  When doing this though, be sure to save me the water elemental cores!25467You are pleasantly surprised to find that after being mangled and masticated by a sea crab, this map is still quite legible.It clearly indicates that a footlocker was buried in the Kelp'thar Forest behind a gigantic mollusk.A well-drawn sketch on the back of the map shows that the owner, along with his key, was eaten by an overgrown crustacean named Kliklak.25468You wouldn't know it from looking at them, but the lovely faerie dragons that inhabit this forest can be truly fearsome if trained properly. They can do amazing things to magical energy...absorb it, redirect it, even nullify it entirely.They're nearly harmless alone, but in large numbers, they can have a stunning effect on a battle. You can find some in the fields to the northwest, but be careful, the Horde is nearby.25469The mountain giants are our most powerful allies of the forest. They're carved from the land itself.Not many of our enemies are willing to fight off a walking hillside. It only takes a few of these to turn the tide of a battle completely.The mountain giants here have been afflicted by some illness lately, but I've seen a healthy group of them to the southwest.25471We will need to press deeper into Vashj'ir if we want to uncover what the naga are doing here.Go to the Lightless Reaches, the giant chasm bordering the Kelp'thar Forest to the west.  If you look across it, you should see a cluster of plant-life surrounding the entrance to Damplight Chamber.Once you're inside the cave, it's a bit of a ride up until you break surface, but I have friends there that should provide you a warm welcome.25472A powerful artifact known as the Flameseer's Staff was lost during the initial onslaught by the enemy forces.  It was an ancient bone staff that granted its wielder power over the elements of fire.Its fragments litter the area around us.  Find them and bring them to Malfurion.  Perhaps the artifact's power will still be of use.25473Sassy's been riding me to supply some Kaja'cola for the party that's being thrown in your honor later today.Oops, was it supposed to be a surprise? You didn't hear it from me!Anywho, with production down these last few days, this is all that I managed to get made. Would you take it to her?25475You have uncovered some sort of strange, egg-shaped device made from metal.  Fiddling with one of its knobs springs the egg to life, as it opens up into some sort of gnomish robotic contraption!  A voice from inside the robotic egg crackles to life.\"My name's Oglethorpe Obnoticus, and my homing robot has crashed!  I will reward you for its recovery; please take this beacon to the robot!\"\"I now have computed the coordinates of the robot for you; it is in a cave near Feral Scar Vale!\"25476The gnome's voice crackles once again from the robot:\"I need to move OOX-22/FE to an open, safe place so it can begin a lengthy take-off procedure.  It has built-in cloaking, but I need time on my end to make it operational again.  Escort the robot from its current location to, let's say, the main road!  That should be a perfect place, and long enough, to get things online!\"\"Escort it safely and then come talk to me in Booty Bay!  Oglethorpe Obnoticus - out!\"25477Greetings, friend.It is good to see that you survived your battle in one piece.While Erunak tries to scry a place of safety for us all, I shall assist you in securing a less strenuous means of transport.I have prepared this baitstick to use near a sea turtle. It is crude, but it should serve to bring one under your control.Once you've become comfortable with the animal, simply guide it back here to me.25478We are staging a relief effort at Westreach Summit for all of Thousand Needles.

If anyone has survived out there, they'll desperately need your help.May the Earth Mother smile upon you.25490, these fiends from the Twilight's Hammer are attempting to scourge this whole mountain clean of all life. Even now they trail behind this inferno, leaving death and ash in their wake.Arch Druid Hamuul Runetotem is behind the fires, trying to salvage the wilderness before it's blotted permanently from the map. Travel southeast, through The Inferno and down the road beyond. Find and aid the Arch Druid.On your way there, clear the roads by killing any Charbringers that you find.25491This land has been scourged by fire, but it may yet renew itself.Some seeds deep in the soil may have withstood the scorching heat here in The Flamewake. These durable plants are the key to this forest's regrowth. Please, collect some of these seedlings for me.25492In their efforts to decimate Hyjal, Twilight's Hammer has elementals scouring the earth in the wake of the fire.They're pulverizing the soil, rooting around in the ash, digging up any scrap of plantlife that survived and destroying it. It's like they're paving the way for... I don't even want to imagine.Stop them before Hyjal is devoid of life. Kill the lava surgers!25493I was stunned to discover that Twilight's Hammer had located - and imprisoned - the great turtle ancient Tortolla. As we speak he is chained above the murky waters of the Ashen Lake.Freeing Tortolla from his bonds will not be easy. But we will take it one step at a time.Head into the Flamewake and collect for me heaps of core hound entrails. I will explain why later.And beware of Nemesis the Usurper while you are there! His time will come, but we are not yet prepared.25494This little guy is a true menace now, isn't he?We're going to have to give him a nice spiked collar if he's going to be a fighting pup.The basilisk matriarch has made her lair off of the road to Winterspring.  Bring me her spiked hide and we'll fashion a collar for our little killer here.25496I don't know if you've picked up on this, but there's a bit of a rivalry between the ogre members of the Twilight's Hammer and the rest of us.For me... it's personal.This one ogre called Gromm'ko has a pet raptor named \"Butcher.\"  He's taken out the last three of my corehound pups.I think this last one will fare differently.  He's got a real killer's instinct.Go to the Seat of the Chosen and challenge Gromm'ko to a match between our two beasts.  Humiliate him for me, damus.25497Our situation is growing a bit desperate, r.We must focus our attention on the naga and their prisoners, but it would be folly to do so without being prepared, and down here that means finding a way to travel more quickly.These sharks are clearly fond of sea turtle. Let's see if we can turn that into our advantage.25498Ready yourself, . There's no telling how this might end up, but we don't have much choice if we are to rescue your friends.Take this sack and use it at the sunken anchor southeast of here. Once you've attracted a shark, do your best to ride it back to me here.If you can do that, you will have a most intimidating means of transportation.25499Before we go any further, we're going to have to get you into shape.Devotion to the Old Gods is not going to save you when some emerald dragon comes chasing after you.

We've been receiving reports back of deliberate attacks from some kind of murlocs down there.The Admiral has to stay here as more men report in from the shell, so I'm having trouble convincing him to get any significant muscle to help the divers. If you'd be up for it, I'm certain they could use your help.Come back and let me know if you get the situation under control.25537I have an idea. A brilliant idea! Those clown-looking fish have developed a symbiotic defensive relationship with the anemones. Having dismissed anemone disguise plausibilities, I've uncovered the chemical attractor that lures the fish.I have a gyrocoptic thermascrub extractor that I've brought down to take samples. Use it to extract the chemical attractor from several of the anemones, then bring the samples back to me for rapid synthesis and deployment.Go with haste! Brilliance is waiting!25538Marvelous creation if I do say so myself. Ready for deployment.Simply spray the clam divers with a bit of the chemical and they shall soon be accompanied by a protective aquatic companion. You can even spray yourself to similar effect if you so desire.Speaking of desire, I would highly recommend that you moderate deployment of the chemical attractor to minimal applications. Large doses could result in undesirable effects...Undesirable for you anyway. Likely very desirable for the fish.Away!25539Here to help with the clam diving?Get to it then. There are clams about everywhere just waiting to be dived.25540We have quite a stock of gathered clams to tote back to the cave, I was simply awaiting someone to do the toting. You've proven dangerous enough to be the sort.I highly expect that such a fine meal shall not pass uncontested by predators on the way back, so I'd make your trip as swift as possible.Thank you for your help, friend. It's been a pleasure.25541We've looted everything that isn't bolted down around here, but I'm not done yet. If we're bothering to do the Steamwheedle Cartel's dirty work for them, we're going to make as much cash as we can while we're here.I haven't seen many earrings on these pirates, so the gold must be in the next best place...their teeth. The Southsea musketeers and strongarms to the south are the higher-ups here; they'll be the ones with the adornment. Bring me back a good fistful of gold fillings.25542The fires are dealt with, but there are still Southsea pirates getting ready to board the Speedbarge.Time to switch to the other side cannon and sink them before it's too late!25543The fires are dealt with, but there are still Southsea pirates getting ready to board the Speedbarge.Time to switch to the other side cannon and sink them before it's too late!25544You've stirred up the hornets, . The ceiling is coming down on us! And their strongest fighters are taking wing on creatures warped and twisted by this world of flame.Get back out there and take them down! Watch out for flaming boulders.25545As we struggled not to drown, my men and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor.Erunak says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I'm inclined to believe him.If we're going to stand a chance, we'll need your help to recover our lost armaments. They should be lying on the sea floor near our shipwrecks.Hurry, , we're defenseless here.25546I'll need your help if I am to get these men ready for battle.Any decent leader knows that his men travel and fight on their stomachs. No food, no victory.These soldiers are weak from their recent ordeal. They'll need sustenance if they're to put up any kind of fight when the need arises.Speaking of traveling on stomachs, I've seen several crabs out there on the sea floor....25547We're as ready as we'll ever be. No sense waiting around for the naga to find us.I'll address the men, then we'll meet the enemy on our own terms and let fate decide the outcome.25548I've been charged with leading our military operations against the enemy.  A humbling task when you consider there are demigods walking among us.I'm going to have you carry out a series of hit-and-run attacks behind enemy lines.  It will be important that you keep the enemy off guard and weaken their numbers ahead of our main force's attack.Your first target will be the Ascendant's Rise, where the most highly trained Twilight's Hammer devotees have achieved a partial elemental state.25549The mad prophets of the Twilight's Hammer congregate in the area just north of the Ascendant's Rise.It is said that their dark visions are granted to them directly by the Old Gods.  Whether or not that is true, they provide tremendous spiritual guidance to the cult.  Attacking the Sanctum of the Prophets will deal a devastating blow to the enemy's morale and if we're lucky you might run into one of the Firelord's own emissaries while you're there.25550The magma giants who serve Ragnaros are kept in line by their king's heavy-handed rule.  Were we to take care of him, the rest will surely fall into disarray.Without the giants, the fight on the ground will get a lot more even.  Perhaps even tilt to our favor.But felling the magma monarch will be no easy task.  Use these drums to enlist the help of the great Tortolla who is capable of holding off King Moltron for an eternity.  But holding him off won't be enough -- and that's where you come in.25551With his gatekeeper gone, you've given the Guardians of Hyjal access to Sulfuron Spire.Ragnaros will have no choice but to defend the main entryway to the Firelands himself.Go through the Twilight's Hammer portal at the Sanctum of the Prophets and meet me inside.  Malfurion and Hamuul will also aid us while the others continue to fight the enemy outside.25552This egg you recovered is an alarming sign, .  The Twilight dragons are usually raised from stolen eggs from other dragonflights, which are then modified through dark magic.This \"natural\" egg is evidence that one of their matriarchs has become a viable broodmother.  We must destroy her before her brood spreads.Go to the Ascendant's Rise where they claim these aberrations are kept and slay one of the juvenile drakes.  We will use its skull to lure out its mother.25553We've located the matriarch's feeding grounds south of the Ascendant's Rise.She will be extremely angry to have lost one of her drakes.  Place the skull there near the carcasses she devours.  If she's anywhere in the vicinity, she will come out and attempt to exact revenge.We will have a surprise waiting for her.25554If we are to banish Ragnaros back into the Firelands, we will need to gain access to Sulfuron Spire.Only the most trusted members of the Twilight's Hammer will have been entrusted with such valuable information.Go search the Ascendant's Rise for any written tomes you might find.  Foul as they are, we cannot waste the opportunity to learn about our enemy's weaknesses.25555According to these tomes, one of Ragnaros' most powerful lieutenants serves as the sole gatekeeper to Sulfuron Spire.You won't be able to defeat him alone.Sound this horn when you engage in combat with Azralon and any of our forces in the vicinity will come to your aid.You must hurry, .  It won't be long before the Firelord realizes what we're up to.25556That foul traitor...I should've known better than to trust his kind. My hunt for Sul'thraze has blinded me.Forgive me, . Mazoga has fled inside of Zul'Farrak, the heart of the Sandfury civilization.If you truly seek the sword, you must pursue him. Do not go alone; the entirety of the Sandfury tribe lies in wait behind those walls, and they will not welcome you.I will stay here. My search for the blade must end. Should you find it, keep it; I must give up before I am consumed.25558This is it.This is where we make our stand.We must defend this ship to our last breath, and make these cretins think twice before approaching it again!May our blades strike fear in their hearts!25559We're not the only ones interested in these ruins, it seem. Of all things, we've got blood elves after our dig sites.I'd expect them to wilt in the heat without all their fancy fountains and cushy pillows, but they're surprisingly scrappy, and they're trying to drive us out of the Southmoon Ruins by force.It's time to crack a few heads. Head over there and teach those elves not to mess with us!25560Without any defenders, the Firelands eggs are vulnerable.Take wing once more and smash those eggs! Simply rush over them to crush them. Search all the nooks, crannies, and side-caves. Hurry!25561The fires may be dealt with, but those Southsea pirates are still getting ready to board the Speedbarge!, you need to go back to Mazzer Stripscrew and get on your boat. Use the cannon to sink them before it's too late!25562The fires may be dealt with, but those Southsea pirates are still getting ready to board the Speedbarge!, you need to go back to Griznak and get on your boat. Use the cannon to sink them before it's too late!25564You've done us a great service, , so I'm going to let you in on a little secret. The men you've saved today aren't your everyday Stormwind troops.We belong to a special detachment of elite soldiers sent here not only to contend with the Horde, but to investigate the massive geological disturbances originating from the nearby sea floor.I tell you this because our top secret equipment lies in the bottom of some of our wrecked ships here.That gear must be retrieved!25565We've had our first big find in years here at the Southmoon ruins. My lads have dug up stone tablets, engraved with ancient writings.The glyphs on the tablets are like nothing we've ever seen, but I have a hunch we can connect them with titanic scripts found at other digsites. Imagine what a breakthrough like that could mean! I need you to go to the Southmoon ruins and help us collect the tablets; the other lads can't leave, lest the blood elves take our site!25566I studied these ruins for years trying to find a way in. We even took a good chunk out of the gate, only to find impenetrable walls beneath. Now the cataclysm may've wrecked everything in there something fierce, but it's done what we couldn't and opened a way in!I'd like you to have the honor, . Head on in there and see if anything's been left uncracked. Be careful though... there's no telling what, or who, might be stirring in there.25574We've identified the general direction where the infiltrators have been coming from, thanks to your work.Now we just need to shut down their camp and put an end to their operations this side of Nordrassil.Take this horn.  It will signal one of our emerald drakes to swoop down and give these Twilight cultists a taste of the flames they so madly worship.25575The weapons the Twilight's Hammer uses against us are crafted by Forgemaster Pyrenduis within these very halls. The metal slices through armor like cheese in the hands of its wielder. Yet, when captured, the steel turns brittle and shatters.So be it, . I'd rather see those cursed arms smashed than delivered to our enemy.Seek out the crates of Twilight arms in these caverns and smash them to pieces.25576Here we are deep within the realm of the fire god and what do we find? The little puppets of Ragnaros, scurrying around to do his bidding.These Dark Iron laborers are finishing and packaging the weapons Twilight's Hammer hopes to use in their conquest of Hyjal. I don't care if they're here of their own free will or if they've been brainwashed or kidnapped... They're a foe of our beloved wolf ancient and they should pay the ultimate price.25577These searing guardians are murderous! We destroy them, and within minutes, they reignite from the ashes.I think there's a way to destroy them permanently, but we'll need someone who can fight through the front ranks., kill the searing guardians and take their smoldering cores to the nearby anvils. Smash them on the Twilight Anvils, and destroy them for good!25578I will take Fandral to Moonglade swiftly.  I hope to return soon so I may continue to aid in the battle.In the meantime, report back to Ysera and inform her of these recent developments.25579Our escape from the shell can't have gone unnoticed, but either the naga at these ruins weren't informed or they don't consider us a threat. I don't intend to take the opportunity for granted - we strike now.I need you to slip into the lower level of the ruins to our west and take out as many of their patrols as you can. We cannot risk any of those patrols finding out about our occupation of this cave - make sure none escape.25580I've taken the liberty of performing some preliminary scouting. The naga may not be aware of our position, but they are not entirely unprepared for intruders.Beyond their patrols, they have set up magical sentry devices that will warn them of unwelcome guests. Fortunately, they seem to have sacrificed quality for quantity, and there is definitely a window in which the devices can be destroyed before their alarms are answered.I trust that you can see to this before our other soldiers arrive.25581Look-- is it?--I need your help. I know most everyone in this cave thinks that we're not in a position to be worrying about anything but our own hides right now, but I cannot dismiss my ancestors so readily.All I want from you, while you're out in the city proper, is to keep a watchful eye out for objects of significance. The statues interest me especially.25582This cave is our only refuge. There's no help on the way. Whatever happens, this cave must remain safe or we are all sure to die down here.We need a forward post to launch our attacks from. Something defensible.In the eastern portion of the ruins on the lowest level, scout the north end of the gardens, the passage leading under the main structure just west of the gardens, and the cluster of buildings at the southeast corner of the ruins, under the bridges.Bring me back any information you can.25583All around you lie the remnants of a fierce battle. The naga skeletons are no surprise, but the weapons and remains of their apparent opponents are somewhat more unexpected.Amidst the bones, you spot a strangely prominent piece of metal jutting out from one of the skulls. It's difficult to tell what sort of weapon it might have once been part of, but it stands out sufficiently to prompt you to retrieve it as evidence.Surely someone back at the cave would be interested in this revelation.25584It'll be crucial to reclaim each of the ancients' shrines, .Follow the road west of the Verdant Thicket, into Wolf's Run.We have operatives stationed there.  Aid them in any way that you can and work your way to the first shrine.The wolf god was known to the elves as Goldrinn and to the orcs as Lo'Gosh.  He will be a fierce ally in our fight against the enemy.25585Now it's time to do something about those darn cannons up on the bluffs to the east!If you'd be so kind, hop into your boat and cruise on over to the Southsea Holdfast.

Or perhaps you're acquainted outside the ring?I wouldn't back down now if I were you. This is the grand finale...25592I've been able to help some of the survivors make it to the cave, but it's starting to get hairy out there. If we didn't have enough problems, some glowing murlocs started creeping up from the nearby crevice to attack the stranded survivors.The men up there are warriors--they won't go down without a fight--but they're much worse for the wear after that damned shell.If you have any breath left in your lungs, get up there and take out some of those murlocs. Hellscream's eyes are upon you.25593A lot of the men haven't made it to the cave yet. It's a safe bet that they're stranded at the vents on the ridge above us.We found some spiralung shells on the way here. They don't produce much air, but it was enough for us to make the cave.I need to stay here to count heads and get them back on their feet as they arrive. Do me a favor - go collect those spiralung shells, get them to any of my men that are still up on the ridge, and give them a swift kick in the arse so that they get moving.25594It was that darn crab!Here I thought that all the exercise from walking here was making me super buff! My pack just kept getting lighter and lighter. But no! That crab snipped a hole in my bag and all my parts were falling out the whole way here.Please, help a good lookin' goblin out, will ya? Go back and help me pick up all of my stray parts. I'm sure those conniving vicious little crabs ran off with some of them too.25595Were they trying to starve us all to death?! Not giving prisoners food is just despicable.We need to get these soldiers fed. The best prospect I spotted on the way here were those giant grouper.

Last I heard, she was fighting off the assault.25636Mack is fading in and out of consciousness.If he's going to make it, he's going to need all the help we can muster.I know a good recipe for turtle soup that's sure to warm him up.Bring me some turtle meat and I'll handle the rest.25637Fathom-Lord Zin'jatar has sent word that the Kvaldir leader has shown himself. I would like you to make your way to him at the far end of the terrace above us, on the middle level of the ruins: Nar'shola Terrace.Kill any Kvaldir that stand in your path on that terrace. We want the echoes of this defeat to ring in their minds so that they will dare not return to threaten our purpose here.Your devotion does not go unnoticed, my battlemaiden. Go knowing that you have my blessing.25638The note in this bottle is soaked through, but still legible.In it, the author claims to have escaped from some sort of undersea naga prison.He is clearly in fear for his life, and you can't help but wonder if it might be one of your recently abducted shipmates.At a loss as to how to locate the escapee, you determine to share the find with Erunak.25640Ve have discovered ze vhereabouts of ze gigantic goblin bomb zat you discovered at Silvervind Refuge.You remember Boog? Ze gnome you rescued from ze orcish vagon of agony? Vell, he and Minx have tracked ze bomb down to Windshear Mine. Go zhere immediately, ! Zey'll be expecting you.25641I've done all I can for you. Muisek stronger than the hippogryph just isn't within my power to work with yet, so I won't make you deal with the disaster that could bring.But while you've been busy, I've fully readied the hippogryph muisek. Take it to my master, Witch Doctor Uzer'i in Camp Mojache. He can create powerful weapons with it, and hopefully he'll be impressed by what I've done.25642Keep your head down, . No need to draw unwanted attention.Looks like the orcs are piling that balloon up with some type of ore from the mine. Get in there and take the ore from the orcs. Bring me back whatever you manage to grab and I'll ship it off to the professor for examination.Before you go, a word of advice: you can avoid the Krom'gar pretty easily in there as (1) they're dumb as dirt and (2) they can't see anything if they're carrying ore. Of course, you need to kill them to get their ore.25643I have been beset by visions, . Visions of an icon of great power falling into sinister hands. I see an amulet, held by the ancient elves...sitting forgotten while its surroundings turn to ruins, until it is captured by demons through treachery and malice.Every night, these sights flow through my dreams. The spirits are warning us. I am too old, and the camp's braves too occupied with guarding us. I must beseech you to follow my visions to the south, to the Darkmist Ruins, and seek out the amulet.25644The egg is unlike any that you've seen before.  Its translucent shell appears to bend the light around it.Accompanying it, you find a note describing the arrival of a fertile broodmother at the Ascendant's Rise.Perhaps you should show this to Aronus.25645The soft glow from the pedestal brightens, and you can see a simple chain left behind. This must be the amulet Sage Palerunner sent you here for...25646The Horde has overrun Windshear Mine. I'm not sure what these orcs are hauling out of here or why they're here, but I know that it can't be good. Get in that mine and take out the management. Without goblin overseers, these peons will be even more worthless.While you're inside, keep your eyes peeled for any other information about the Horde operation in the mines.Good luck!25647You've discovered a parchment with an impressive looking Horde seal imprinted upon its page. Unfortunately, the rest of the document is completely illegible as it is in orcish.Take the letter to Boog. He might know what to do with it!25648Hmmph... it looks like your services are being requested elsewhere.  Ag'tor Bloodfist is looking for recruits to assist the Horde's ventures in Azshara, north of Orgrimmar.I'm sure you still have work to do here in Durotar, and I understand that they'll shortly be asking for your help in the Barrens.  I wouldn't be going anywhere yet if I were you, but if you're itching for some manifest destiny... Azshara awaits.25649The good news is that Minx is fluent in orcish and she's nearby. Head back into the mine and find her. She's probably deeper inside, standing around being useless.Don't forget the parchment!25650The letter is actually an order from Horde high command. Someone named Overlord Krom'gar has issued a \"strip job\" on this mine in order to obtain something called azure iron flake. Presumably this flake is obtained from breaking down the ore.It gets worse. They plan to mix the azure flake with the explosives sitting inside the huge bomb outside and blow up Windshear Hold.We don't have a moment to lose, ! Take this translated copy of the letter and return to Boog! He'll know what to do next.25651So, I've been thinkin'...If someone's out-of-their-mind-guano-crazy, do they know it?Case in point, I coulda swore that I'd collected a barrel of gunpowder from the cannonballs around here, but it's nowhere ta be found.I distinctly remember lifting the cannonballs from them Gilblins just west of here.Maybe they're right... maybe I really have lost it.25652We don't have a moment to lose, . You're going to have to commandeer that hot air balloon and stop it!How? I have no idea! We don't have time to argue details! Grab onto that rope ladder and climb up! Just start banging on stuff once you're inside!If you somehow manage to stop the balloon and survive, report to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold in the west.Good luck, we're all counting on you. Now if you'll excuse me I'm going to RUN FOR MY LIFE!25653Nemesis... destroyed.I feel rejuvenated.Powerful.Awakened.Tell Ysera my strength is hers.The Twilight's Hammer will fall.25654Edana Hatetalon is the queen of the Northspring harpies that reside in the ruins to the west. It is her malicious will that leads the harpies to defend their nests among the ruins of our people.The harpies can call to her with a horn they carry - blowing it by the Hatetalon stones, in the northern part of the ruins, will summon Edana.Show no mercy for these foul creatures. Slay her, and bring her dark heart to me.25655Skylord Omnuron has been too gentle with the Wormwing harpies. He allows them to share a perch on this mountain just because they're creatures of the air. Well , not all creatures of the air are created equal.When the attacks on Hyjal began, the Wormwing went into a frenzy. They're up there right now, assaulting a sacred shrine they once claimed to revere.I'm not troubled. Now we have a reason to drive them from Hyjal, don't we?25656There's a pattern to these Wormwing attacks. While groups make a showy assault on the shrine itself, others swoop into the nearby nests and make off with eggs from all the flying creatures of Hyjal.These animals are under our protection. Before we find out why the Wormwing are doing this, it's up to us to rescue as many eggs as we can from their talons.25657So, seein' as ya been so kind to me, I'm inclined to let you in on a special secret.I've found the biggest shiney of all, no more than 50 steps from where we're standin'!Only one thing stands between you, me, and great fortune - and his name is Gnaws.Don't fret now - I've got a plan.Gnaws loves his grubs, so I've loaded one up with that gunpowder so as to make like a trap of sorts, ya see?Just set it floatin' up in the reef. Once the shark is dead, we're rich!25658My lady, I have a request from the High Priestess that I am to pass along to you. Many of the city's defenses remain from long before it sunk beneath the waves, and some of them are but a trivial task to reactivate, were it not for the countless Kvaldir that stand in our way.We are told you are to be fighting on Nar'shola Terrace above us. You would do my lady a great service if you would but touch some of the devices as you pass. Your noble blood should prove more than sufficient to reactivate them.25659The Kvaldir leader has shown his rotting, ugly face but a short swim from here, down this hall to our west. We kill him now and the Kvaldir occupation of our once beloved city shall be ended.Beware Battlemaiden, for he is no weakling. He has many Kvaldir at his command. Some Sira'kess Sea Witches have been dispatched to weaken him during your attack, but they will be interrupted if you let any of his Kvaldir attack them.Show no mercy, Battlemaiden.25660You think I'm going to just let you go after you killed me like that, mon? No way! I didn't create a piratical mercantile empire out of nothing just to see you bring me down.You're going to help me get back to life. Find my ex-wife, Ajamon, on the north side of the Holdfast. Just follow your nose. She'll be wherever the stinky brewing cauldron is.25661Fine, I be helpin' ya. He not gettin' outa payin' me alimony that easy! 'Sides, there be the baby he had with me sistah ta take care of!First thing we needin' is the innards of his closest friends. That'd be his cap'ns.Go down there an' pay the three of them a visit.25662Yesterday morning I dispatched a squadron of huntresses on a mission into Windshear Crag to obtain information about Horde operations in Stonetalon. Field intelligence reports that they have all been captured, including their squad leader, Huntress Illiona.Head east into Windshear Crag and slay the Krom'gar infantry that occupy the crag and take from them their keys to unlock the Horde cages holding our sisters.Do your best to locate Illiona once you've freed the huntresses.25663Although the guardian of all winged creatures is no longer with us in body, I sometimes hear her voice in the whisper of swaying leaves., we ask much of you as you set out to preserve this mountain. Before going on, take a moment to reflect.Take this offering of nectar to Aviana's burial circle, a circle of stones just outside the main door of the shrine. Perhaps some time alone with Aviana's memory will help sharpen your focus.25664A winged visage? Could it be...?, there's no time to waste. You may have been speaking to Aviana herself, trying to return to us.I'll need something from Aviana's past to reach out to her. High atop the ridge overlooking this shrine, you'll find a series of huge nests belonging to Blaithe, an ancient bird of prey that was once her consort. For ten thousand years he's been mad with grief.Go to one of his roosts, and use this call to summon him. Kill Blaithe and bring me one of his feathers.2566525666Make no mistake, , that is one clever shark. You don't survive down here as long as he has without a little extra smarts.What I'm saying is he won't be fooled so easily again. We're going to have to change our approach a bit.I won't bore you with the details just yet. For now, I need you to collect a bunch of the innards from these giant sea grubs.Think you can handle that?25667The wendigos in the Grizzled Den to the southwest of town have long been a thorn in our side. They're never quite strong enough to threaten Kharanos directly, yet they prey on travelers, mountaineer patrols, and supply convoys.I'm going to be withdrawing my observers from the Grizzled Den because I need them on the troll front. Would you help my men finish culling the wendigo population? Without strength of numbers, they won't be able to attack us.25668With the Frostmanes making trouble to our east, the wendigos have sensed our weakness and grown bolder in their raids. Only one of the four most recent supply wagons has made it here safely. The wendigos made off with the rest, stashing it in the Grizzled Den, a cave southwest of town. If you're willing to go down there and recover the stolen supplies, you would have the gratitude of all the townspeople and the mountaineers defending Kharanos.25669Prepare yourself, ! The Warlord comes! Kill him and take his key. Use the key to release me.Should we make it out of here, report the following to Lord Fallowmere at Windshear Hold:The Horde has aborted their plans to destroy Windshear Hold due to the efforts of one of our heroes. They now plan to move the bomb to Battlescar Valley and drop it on our armies battling the Horde at that location.They must be stopped!25670If ol' Gnaws had heels he'd be on 'em right now.Fortunately for you, I think like a shark.Gnaws is mad as all get out and we're gunna use that to our advantage.Here, I found this chain while out treasure-huntin'. Use it to tie off to that harpoon gun.When Gnaws sees ya he'll be consumed with rage - that's when we strike!You try to finish him off and I'll sneak in there and grab the shiney.Hurry, , before he grows them teeth back!25671The Horde's numbers swell as reinforcements from Ashenvale and Azshara arrive. There is no diplomacy to be had with the beasts. This is Hellscream's Horde and Hellscream's Horde wants our blood! We will not sit idly by and allow them to take our land and kill our people. We must act!We must thin the Horde! Consider it your daily responsibility.Venture forth into Stonetalon Mountains and slay as many of the Horde as you are able. Let them know that the Alliance will not surrender!25672These organs be a good start, mon, but we still be needin' lotsa other tings. Normally, we'd be gettin' stuff from family now, but dats only me and my sistah's boy, and Tony ain't worth it!So, we be substitutin' some stuff. Lotsa carcasses, in fact!Deep down in the Shimmering Deep, there's tons of dem from when the water came rushin' in. Killed all of dem creatures. Go down there and bring me up some.25673Mr. P is sick, . Won't you help him? All you have to do is find his hat and batteries and he'll be all better. I'd go get them myself, but I can't leave Mr. P alone!His hat was stolen by the meanies in the Venture Co. over at the water wheel and his batteries are hidden around Windshear Crag. You'll just have to look real hard for those!Would you kindly bring Mr. P's stuff back so he can teach those baddies in the Horde a lesson?25674This is actually an old orc city... one of the oldest on Azeroth.  That is, it was until the ogres pushed us out.Today's Horde refuses to be pushed over by ogres.  My troops and I took the town back by force, and the ogres who once lived here now work as my servants.  Now, our real work begins.You look strong enough, but I'd like to see some proof.  Kill one of the ogres that still besiege us, and return to me.25675I saw your handiwork down there, .  How'd you like to hunt some more ogres?We only enslaved the ones we could catch.  Most of the strongest ogres still brood in Dreadmaul Post, plotting our demise.  Our guards can handle the scattered ambushers, but we are not yet firmly entrenched, and will buckle quickly under a coordinated attack.Go south to Dreadmaul Post and send a message, .  Slay the strongest before they get any ideas.25676We don't have any hope of taking the Nethergarde Mines from the Alliance... at least not yet.  Nethergarde is well-defended, and their supply routes are established and strong.  Our goal, then, is to damage their economy.  We can't take the mine by force, but with surgical strikes we can drastically reduce the mine's efficiency.I have men creating a distraction outside the mines.  Head east, sneak into the mines, and speak with Rofilian Dane for your assignment.25677All over this cavern you'll find unguarded piles of ore, just waiting to be tampered with.  Our first choice would be to steal the ore, obviously, but that requires mine carts, protection, and labor... three things we just don't have.  So instead, we're just going to ruin this little mining party with a little bit of highly corrosive solvent.Take this bottle - CAREFULLY - and pour it onto those heaps of ore.  'Cause if we can't have this ore, then neither can they.25678It costs the Alliance approximately fifty gold to train a miner, two hundred to train an engineer, and three hundred to train a foreman.  Every Alliance goon that we kill isn't just a military victory... it's a financial one.Now get down there and destroy their workers!25679The next phase of operations takes place deeper within the mine.  Speak with Tak'arili for your next assignment.  Just follow the mine cart rails to the southeast, and follow the curve around.  You'll see him at the entrance to the mine's upper chamber.It's been a pleasure doing business with you, .25680First things first... it looks like we got ourselves a problem.  These miners down the pathway to the right have been runnin' around like a chickens without they heads on.  My best guess is that they dug too deep and found somethin' nasty... a demon, an elemental, or some kind o' tentacley beast.Tak'arili don't like surprises.  Find out what the problem is and take care of it, then we get ourselves back on track.25681The tunnel ahead, headin' west, will take you straight to Chief Prospector Hondo's office.  He's the big cheese around here, and Tak'arili's heard tell that he's a darn fine miner.  That's why he's gotta die.There's just one problem: the pathway is completely FILLED with those pesky Nethergarde flunkies.  That's why you gotta disguise yourself.  Hop inside this box here, and sneak down the pathway.  Hopefully you won't draw too much suspicion on your way to da killin'.25682We be done here, mon.  Only thing left to do is send a report to Okrilla.  You doin' anything right now?25683I meant what I said, .  You helped me, now I'll pass on what I know.A demon hunter recently came through here, but only briefly.  He was headed south, speaking of demons.  Normally I'd have slain the night elf on sight, but he didn't seem to be Alliance scum, and anybody who kills demons is useful to me for the time being.You should check in with Lynnore and Drazial, a pair of blood mages I sent down that way.  They've camped in the back of an ogre cave.25684I admit, we haven't picked the most... convenient of spots to perform our studies, especially for passing adventurers who wish to enter and leave at will.  Our agreement with the ogres is tenuous, and I'm afraid we can't convince them not to attack you when you draw near.However, I can allow you to attune yourself to our bloodstone teleporters.  Simply place your hands on the stone to my right, and you will be teleported outside of the cave.  Then use the stone outside to teleport back!25685To perform the ritual you've requested - and perhaps some more rituals in the near future - we're going to need blood.  The Blasted Lands are filled with every type of reagent we might need for our blood magic... it's just a matter of the correct combination.Basilisks and hyenas, even amounts.  And we're going to need plenty of it.  Head east, to the center of the Blasted Lands.  And don't forget... you can use that teleporter!25686Our goal is to find the demon hunter, Loramus Thalipedes.  Let me know when you are ready to begin the blood ritual, and then stand back.25687Loramus Thalipedes is dead.  Well, let me step back... that's an assumption on my part, but I do know that his body lies in three pieces.If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse.  All three pieces are nearby... the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves.  In fact, one of them is in that chest, down the ledge behind me...25688Up on the bluffs above our comfy cave is a powerful altar.  A powerful DEMONIC altar, guarded by cultists, but powerful nonetheless.  If you can reach it, you can use it to bring Loramus back to us.The altar will likely resist your efforts, so you'll have to protect Loramus' body while the ritual completes.  Bring the demon hunter back to me afterwards.25689I was hunting a demon named Razelikh, when his ogre lieutenant Grol assaulted me.  I was caught unaware, and I died... but so did Grol.Razelikh plans to return to the Blasted Lands and overwhelm the lands with his demons.  Even now, he is preparing to summon his legions to eliminate us.Deliver this to Wazzik at the Dark Portal, to the southeast.  He will guide you.  Quickly!  We haven't much time!25690Contrary to popular belief, blood elf bloodmages do NOT drink blood.  We eat normal food like everybody else - something which can be hard to come by in the recesses of an ogre stronghold.The ashmane boars in the central valley of the Blasted Lands are, if nothing else, convenient for eating, as their meat does not require any cooking.  Would you hunt these boars and help us replenish our foodstores?25691Loramus wants us - er, YOU - to gather granite chips from these chunks of rock around the Dark Portal.  I don't know what he'd want rocks for, but I have my suspicions, and they're not pleasant ones.Use this pick and look for small outcroppings of rock along the edge of the portal's blast radius.25692Thalipedes wants demon blood.  Personally, the stuff doesn't even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that's neither here nor there.Luckily for you, the area around the Dark Portal is crawling with demons.  Infernals, felhounds, felguards... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.25693That's all that Loramus asked of us.  When you see him, make sure you let him know how much of a help I was.  I fear he will not see my hand in this.25694The only reason you see me standing aside Alliance soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity... however slightly.  We have been charged with protecting the Dark Portal from unauthorized travel, and with the recent cataclysm, we are particularly susceptible to an attack.  We've already heard reports of black dragons in the area...With my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check.  Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants.  Slay them.25695I have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for.  I've seen the Alliance periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there.  I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting.  My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed...25696Oh, right, I received a notification from someone a few days ago.  The Reliquary, was it?  They're looking for someone to... do something...Ah, here it is!  Yes, Rohan Sunveil of The Reliquary is seeking able-bodied adventurers to assist with an archaeological expedition to the south.Here, take this with you.  Why don't you go speak with that elf?25697When my master helped me to take my eyes out, he gave me the gift of sight... a sight much greater than yours, or even of these blood-craving elves.  My sight allows me to see objects of demonic power, such as the Amulet of Allistarj.Allistarj himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside the Serpent's Coil, to the east.  Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to Razelikh's perch.25698Sevine's amulet is in the hands of a murloc, far to the east, on a shelf that overlooks the Shattershore.  How it ended up in that murloc's possession, I cannot say, but I can state with certainty that you will find it there.I feel a stronger connection with Sevine than with the rest of Razelikh's servants... possibly because she built the Altar of Storms, upon which you resurrected me.  Bring her Amulet to Lynnore, along with the rest.25699Grol... the ogre who tore me apart.It would seem that Grol's body has changed hands several times since we died together, but it no longer rests with the ogres.  His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east.  His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to Razelikh, and therein lies our chance to stop his madness.25700The enchantment on these amulets was not complex.  Together, their power will grant you access to Razelikh, the amulets' creator.I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and Loramus.  Speak with me when you are both ready.25701Hero, listen well.First, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northeast.  The usher will take us to the top of the rise.  Once there, I need you to help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear that I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to.  The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.If we succeed, speak with Wazzik.25702Rockpool... attacked.  Naga turn, take village, villagers.Salt-Flop escape, but others do not.  Go south, talk to Chief Neptool.  Maybe he survive.25703The Bloodwash naga and the Rockpool murloc have lived among one another for as long as we could remember.  We have always had our differences, but never provoked one another.  Why, then, would they turn on us?You see what they do now?  They enslave us, sacrifice us, force us to fight one another.  I will stop them, ... and you will be my weapon.25704There's only one ting left dat we can do. Ya gotta slay someone with the big mojo in Tony's presence.No, not me!Ol' Magus Tirth went crazy when he tried ta stop the waters rushin' in at the Cataclysm. Now he be hauntin' the area just south of the Holdfast.Take dis soul stick an' use it on his corpse, mon. Then bring Tony back an' we be gettin' him back in his body.Ya can use me spirit portal ta get down there an' back.25705Neptulon the Tidehunter is our god.  He was the god of the Bloodwash, too, but they have turned their back on him, it seems.  They now choose to worship only Azshara, their naga queen.  You will see likenesses of Azshara littered around their settlements, carved out of seastone.That weapon will do.  Send it through their Azsh'ir idols.  They need to be reminded that our father Neptulon is the only one who truly rules the seas.25706No number of naga deaths will bring back the Rockpool tribe, but any amount of revenge will help the spirits of my people rest more easily.Many of the more powerful Bloodwash have set up a fortress in the caverns to the northwest.  Slay them, in the name of the Rockpool.  The remaining Bloodwash have erected gladiatorial pools and Azsh'ir altars on our beach, where they pit my people against one another and worship their false god.  Slay them, in the name of the Tidehunter.25707The Rockpool tadpoles left upon this crate appear tired, scared, and nearly dried out.  They need to be taken to the water, and quickly.Perhaps if you can drag this crate across the beach and into the Forbidden Sea, far off the coast of the Red Reaches, then they will have a chance of escaping, and the Rockpool murlocs may live on...25708Based on what you're telling me, it sounds like there aren't many survivors... just restless spirits.  The least we can do is give them their rest.Head back to the Shattershore and vanquish the worgen ghosts that still remain.  Doing so should release their spirit from this world and allow them to pass into the next.25709The other thing that concerns me about those shipwrecks is all the vultures that they've attracted.  Knowing how those birds operate, they've already picked the bones clean, but still... we can't allow them to further desecrate the bodies of our friends.Before I brewed, I hunted.  Here, take this bow, and more importantly, these arrows.  They've been laced with a little concoction that should give those bonepickers a surprise.25710Nethergarde has stood steadfast for years against the demon onslaught that plagues this land.  Our watch is never-ending, our vigilance unfaltering, and our courage bottomless.We have held these lands since the portal opened, but now these Horde insects have the insolence to stand in our way!?  We have protected THEM as well as we have protected ourselves!Let's see if you've got a hand for combat.  Slay one of the Horde's Okril'lon scouts that nibble at our perimeter.25711The Horde are a nuisance that we will deal with, but they are proving more difficult than previously expected.  You are to put a stop to this.To the west of Nethergarde, the Okril'lon main forces press on our defenses.  They currently hold the Nethergarde Mines, and they mean to move into the supply camps and, eventually, the Keep.  Thin their numbers and delay their advance, .25712Lungertz is a strong leader, but he is proud.  He understates the pressure that the Horde is really putting on us.  Without our mine... Nethergarde is penniless.We need to move the Horde forces from the supply camp NOW, and doing so means killing their commander, Captain Metlek.  He's not a strong leader, and prefers to bark orders from the back lines, but even so, his death might buy us the victory we need.25713Say there... , is it?  I've got a proposition for you which involves explosions.  Interested?I couldn't help but overhear your conversation with the quartermaster.  You see... I've been working on an explosive device.  It's not very effective against other creatures, but devastating against artillery.  If you're heading back into the field to visit those orcs, find some enemy supplies and give this thing a try.  Who knows... maybe they like explosions too.25714It's time for you to visit the Watcher.  He's been in a bit of a mood lately, and I'm not quite sure why.Head up to the top of the mage tower and check in with him.  I don't have any work for you here, but I'm certain that he will.25715We've seen countless ships sail past the shore to the southeast, but most pass by inconspicuously.  Several days ago, however, a powerful storm carried several of the ships to shore and left them wrecked.I'd bet a pint of Nethergarde Bitter that they were Horde ships if I didn't love Nethergarde Bitter so much.  I can pay you gold, though, if you'll go check out those ships and report back.25716You may have already run into some of the Shadowsworn cultists that dwell in the caves just to the southwest of Nethergarde.  They do not impress an immediate danger upon our fortress, but I fear that they are planning something more dreadful than you can imagine.The low-ranking members carry spell foci that might hold an answer.  Bring some back to me intact, if you can wrench them from the cultists' hands.25717The Reliquary is focused on the acquisition and preservation of magical artifacts.  Our particular excursion is focused on the demonic artifacts that are hidden in what used to be the Tainted Scar.A worgen druid has taken residence in the scar and is coaxing a forest to grow.  He seems to be failing, however, as the area is still infested with demons.Anyhow, his forest stands in the way of our excursion, as do these demons.  Slay the tainted ones, then return to me so we might deal with the druid.25718Your demon-slaying down there bought our scouts enough time to get a good look at that druid.  My intelligence tells me that his name is Marl Wormthorn... a rogue Gilnean druid of substantial power.  He resides in Maldraz, the large, twisted tree at the center of the forest, and is protected from harm by some strange force.  Whether that force is of demonic or natural sources, we have yet to determine.Speak with Elijah.  He may have some more information for you.25719We need a way to get Wormthorn's attention.  Something to break him out of his trance.  Something that's guaranteed to work.The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.25720Wormthorn's unnatural forest threatens our excursion's progress.  His trees' roots break our picks, his moss grows over our excavation sites, and his animals attack my men.  When it comes to digging, I'll take a demon-infested wasteland over a forest any day.Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance.  Return to me when he is no more.25721I'm here because Muradin himself knew that this survey needed someone to keep these buffoons on their toes. They're all too scared of the wildlife to do a thing! If I'm to get them off their duffs, I'm going to need some cleanup done.We've got an elemental problem, first off. The flood did such a number here that the water itself's gone hysterical.I bet you've never slapped the sense into an entire lake before, but I'm askin' it of you now. Whallop those elementals but good for me.25722The destruction of the Stonewrought Dam was no small thing, . We're here to find out just how bad the damage is. A mighty load of water's rampaged through here, and if it's disturbed the earth too far, we could be in for worse later on.We can tell a lot from studying the sediment of the flooded area. I need as many soil samples as I can get, so if you could head out there and collect some more, I'd much appreciate it.25723The local wildlife's all messed up from the flood, it seems. This fen used to be full of crocolisks, but I haven't spotted a single one.What I have spotted are threshadons. Never used to be any here, so the flood must've swept them all right out of Loch Modan.Lucky for us, because they're tastier than crocolisks, and I'm running low on provisions. Bring me back some threshadon meat for the camp, and I'll gladly pay you for it.25724The cataclysm has thrown the balance of power in Dun Morogh into question, . Without warning, a wave of troggs emerged from the caves near Gnomeregan and overran the Frostmane trolls. The trolls have been migrating east ever since.There has always been a Frostmane presence up on Shimmer Ridge, to the northwest, but with the migration, the trolls now surround us. We can't allow the trolls to use this position to their advantage. While my men hold the line in the east, strike against Shimmer Ridge.25725We're good on provisions, but we're in need of some medicine. Half the camp's fiercely hung over, and a remedy's in order.Luckily, I know a good folk remedy taught to me by my dear old mum. We just need some local ingredients.Gather me some fenbush berries, if you would. They keep to where there's water and shade, so look along the shore and near other plants.25726Alright, I need you to help me find my dumpy level.What's that look for? That's right! I said my dumpy level! It's a piece of significant surveying equipment!I didn't name the bloody thing, alright? Go look it up! All I did was leave it on a rock long enough for one of those horrible oozes to swallow it up. The place is crawling with 'em, but one of them should still have it inside.25727The Dark Iron clan is up to no good out here. And if that surprises you, you're thicker than the addled blotters over in that tent. Muradin may pay lip service to those sooty cretins back in Ironforge, but out here all bets are off.We had a raid against the camp last night, and one raid is too many. Their leader's a stout fellow by the name of Glowerglare, and he's hiding in the cave on the south bank of the river.Bring me Glowerglare's beard as proof he's no longer a threat to us and Ironforge.25728Now Mr. P just needs an angel to help him navigate. Will you be that angel, ? With you helping we can go out into the crag and kill bunches and bunches of Horde! Waddya say? Come on, ! PRETTY PLEASE WITH SUGAR ON TOP?If we kill enough Horde, Mr. Fallowmere will buy us all ice cream!25729Come in, ! Are you zhere? I have noted on ze map that you are near ze Cragpool Lake vater vheel, is that correct?It vould appear that ze Venture Co. has holed up at ze vheel. Have a look around vhile you are up zhere. If you happen to zee a traitorous gnome by ze name of Gerenzo Wrenchwhistle, put your boot firmly up his keester for me and for Gnomeregan! I vill pay handsomely!25730By order of people not wanting to get themselves devoured whole by a really huge fish, Cragpool Lake is OFF-LIMITS! Someone decided to up and put a huge, dwarf-eating fish in the lake.It is strongly recommended that you stay out, however, if you are the heroic type and have a few friends around, do us all a favor and kill the damned thing! Maybe I can get some fishing done then, eh?If you manage to actually do it, meet me back at Windshear Hold for a reward.-Ol' Irongoat25731It's time to get to the bottom of this. We need to interrogate the matron of these beasts, Marion Wormwing. We'll capture her alive. Here's the plan:The harpies communicate across the ridge using a series of signal fires. If we extinguish one, Marion is sure to come investigate.You fight her as a distraction while I sneak up behind and grab her. I'll leave the questioning to you. Let's get her, !25732We did it!Gnaws is down, and I have our shiney!That's good news.Darn shiney is cursed treasure - makes everyone who touches it a skeleton.That's bad news.These cursed pirates say the Gilblin King has the secret to remove the hex.That's good news.I can't step foot outside the reef or I'll be cursed forever.That's bad news.25733Thelgen Rock's an important site here. We need to use it to study the bedrock formations an' such.Of course, it can't be that easy, so Thelgen Rock's also full of giant cave stalkers. Big as a dwarf and twice as hungry. Like I said, these fancy-lads are researchers, not warriors, so if I want them to get anything done you're gonna have to help me clear the filthy bugs out.Kill as many of the blighters as you can and I'll make it worth your while, .25734I'm feeling slightly less wobbly now, so I'm going to start setting up the level for my final measurements here. There's one last thing I need from you.There's a seismograph set up deep within Thelgen Rock to record any movements in the earth. If things have been continuing to shift since the cataclysm, this'll tell us.The seismograph's at the very bottom of the cave; find it and bring the record it's created back to me.25735Thelgen Rock over yonder is something of a natural wonder. It's the only known source of incendicite in the world!The stuff's rare, highly sought, and ridiculously explosive. Hit it with a steel mining pick and you'll set off a fireworks show that'll put a room full of goblins to shame.Luckily, I've developed a spark-proof pick for such tasks. I'll loan it to you if you bring me back some incendicite ore, and I'll split you in on the profits, of course.25736This is all that's left of the huge elemental that attacked you: a frothing orb of water that continues to fight your grip.Forba might appreciate seeing proof that you helped stop another threat to the camp.25737From what I've learned about these water-goblins, this should work.I've crafted a shark-tooth necklace from the items you scrounged up. Not only is it a shiny trinket, but it's a memento of Gnaws' death. There's no telling how many gilblins were eaten alive by that monster.Offer the necklace to the gilblin leader. In exchange, I need an artifact called The Pewter Pounder.And be quick about it, kid. I'm already beginning to miss my flesh...25738Not bad, , assuming it's the real thing. I'll hafta send one of my boys out to make sure your story checks out.In the meantime, you're gunna do a little somethin' for me, see, 'cause this little trinket ain't worth givin' up The Pewter Pounder - not by a longshot!My cousin, Gilblingle, has had his eye on my throne for years. Dumb as a bag of coral, that one - but still dangerous.You take him out, and then we'll talk.25739Was traveling up Webwinder Path, coming from Northwatch Expedition Base Camp in the south. Ambushed. Not by Horde. Spiders. Big, ugly, hairy, nasty spiders.Fought off dozens, maybe hundreds. Lost count. Overtaken by their queen. She took a chunk right out of me. Barely made it out alive. Might be dying.More of my men coming. Must provide safe passage. Kill spider queen.25740The dragon Sethria must be stopped. We know that her roost is south of here, along the southern cliffs of Hyjal, but beyond that we know little else.I have sent Thisalee on a fact-finding mission to Sethria's Roost. She specifically requested your help - evidently you made quite an impression with the young druid.Meet Thisalee just beyond the tunnel leading to Sethria's Roost. And remember, this is a fact-finding mission - don't do anything crazy!25741Poisoned travelers are becoming a common occurrence around Windshear Hold. Why just the other day a Northwatch Captain fell prey to the spiders of the Webwinder Hollow. He would have died to the poison had it not been for my anti-venom. Sadly my stock of anti-venom is almost completely depleted.If you're heading south towards Webwinder Hollow, would you kindly recover Deepmoss venom sacs for me? You should be able to acquire them from Deepmoss spiders.25742A deal's a deal.I present you - mysterious  stranger - with the one and only Pewter Pounder.You may approach and receive this illustrious gift.There, now, while it may look to be a simple hammer to the untrained eye, there are surely many hidden properties that will only manifest themselves when the appropriate situation arises.Take good care of this treasure, stranger. It has been in my royal possession for... well... days, now!25743This is no magic solution to my curse! It's just a hammer!I may be crazy, but I'm not stupid.There's NO WAY I'm gunna use this to break my shiney - not after all I've gone through to get it.But that means I'm stuck down here for eternity...I had just learned to sail, you know.Ohhh... I can't decide.Here, you take the hammer and I'll just set the shiney down and look the other way.25744, great job defending the Speedbarge!

This place crawls.Let's start slaughtering these dragonkin and worry about why they're here later.25747The Admiral used the information you gathered for him to make a forward post under the terrace to our west. He's been preparing there for some kind of attack against the naga.You should go to him immediately and inform him of the scope of what you've witnessed. Our force is small, and I fear for our soldiers if we charge in too recklessly.Take my sea horse. It knows the way.25748I see. The news you bring is grim, but I was not entirely unprepared for such possibilities. Without any effective scouting of naga numbers, I knew our plan was risky, but that's why we established this forward post.Let me put it to you plainly, . If we do not keep the naga off-balance, they will bring the fight to us. We do not have the structures or the men to mount a defense, so that is not an option.We need more time. Can you thin their numbers to the south?25749I overheard your conversation with the Admiral. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Can you bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time?25751Hello! I've been scrambling, scrambling to prepare for the Admiral's assault. He's got high hopes and high plans to blow all kinds of things sky high! ...or water high? That would do.Blowing things high takes EXPLOSIVES! I don't have explosives. It's saddening. Very saddening.I've been properly inspired to improvise though, and the solution has become apparent. The bulbs on the seaweed hanging from the ruins contain a surprisingly volatile gas. Maybe you might gather some for me? Pretty Please?25752We have everything we need to begin the attack.If your claims were correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the attack. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga.Kill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old-fashioned way.25753That was a disaster! Most of our men went down to spears before making it anywhere near the rendezvous.We're only going to be able to hold this position for so long before the naga overrun us. We need to get out there to the southwest and save as many of the men as we can find - do anything you can.They won't last long. Please hurry!25754Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.We'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did.One of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of this round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins.Up for some scouting?25755Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment.I will tend to these soldiers - you need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden.Please hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time.25756If we're going to get those oil drilling rights, we need to know what the Horde is offering. How can we win if we can't do them one better?!Their negotiator, Trackmaster Zherin, is up there talking with one of their khans right now.

There's got to be a way around that armor plating!Run out there and fetch some of the Twilight armor plates that are waiting to be installed. We'll figure out how to beat this.25760The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past.I've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade.Perhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance.25761We have to stop these juggernauts before they're completely encased in armor. Right now they're vulnerable, but only if we pry aside the plates and hack at the marred flesh beneath.Take my shiv, and jam it between the plates of armored juggernauts to deprive them of their armor.Once they break from their trance, you're in for a tough fight - keep prying loose that armor and stop those juggernauts!25762What do we have here? A ? Come to steal our land with your honeyed tongue and promises?You do not fool me. I have lived a long time, and I know what dealing with your kind means. But the khans do not listen to their elders like they used to.Since you are here, I will put you to use.

Kill the kobolds and take their special cheese.Bring it all back and I'll cook up a masterpiece!25838With your help, we've managed to push toward Frostmane Retreat. Our forces will soon be in position to dwindle down the Frostmane trolls' reserves, leaving their village open to attack.That's where the Gnomeregan covert ops team comes in. Their technicians have figured out a way to deploy operatives behind enemy lines without alerting the Frostmanes to our presence. Head to Steelgrill's Depot, just northeast of town, and speak with Delber Cranktoggle. He'll tell you more about it.25839The cataclysm has brought our enemies closer to home, so the chief of Gnomeregan covert operations asked me to build a device to dispatch personnel quickly and quietly to any corner of Dun Morogh.Behold, the ultrasafe personnel launcher!With a jolt of electricity and the benefit of a VLD parachute system, uh, that's 'very late deployment' for you laymen, this baby'll get you to the front in no time.

Battok will be in the village, just east of here.25841Delber's technicians have been up day and night helping us prepare for this strike. Aside from building and tuning the personnel launcher, his men have prepared the covert operations air wing for a strike on Frostmane Retreat.

Hellscream's armies show no mercy and no compassion, killing anything that stands in their way.But no more! Take the armaments you brought for us and find Grimtotem in battle with the Horde. Give them the weapons of the Alliance and watch as they destroy their Horde assailants! Go, there is much work to do, ally.25848By the time that we received word that Hellscream had sent another mag'har orc to oversee the Horde troops in southern Stonetalon, it was too late. Camp Aparaje was burned to the ground and all Grimtotem in the area incinerated.Now the Horde have four of their most fearsome generals commanding the battle for Greatwood Vale, including the mag'har, General Glubgok.You must travel to the ruins of Camp Aparaje, south of here, and kill the generals.

Your first mission in Southern Barrens should be fairly straightforward.Two days ago we received a distress signal from Commander Walpole.

I'll forward news of our alliance with the Grimtotem to Northwatch command.25853I'm in charge of supplying this dig. It's not that bad, but having to pick up and move out so fast wasn't exactly ideal!Archaeologists need tools, you know. You can't run around pulling up priceless antiquities with your bare hands. If you're going back to the dig site, can you bring back the tools that got left behind?25854Have you heard some raptors are intelligent enough to be domesticated? It's true! I've seen hunters tame them.It gets quite lonely out here, you know, even with Wenna to keep me company... a pet's just what I need to brighten my spirits. A little baby raptor would be the best!If you're out there slaughtering the adults, would you mind bringing me back some mature eggs? You can tell if they're ready to hatch by the wobbling.25855I've been coming up short on parts recently for my engineering projects, and the other day I finally saw why: the Mosshide gnolls have been making off with them!I don't have any idea what they could possibly want them for, but I need those gizmos back. They're probably strewn all over the marsh by now, but if you see any, could you gather them and bring them back?25856I've skinned crocs in the wetlands for years, . Things have changed though.You see, not to bore you with a sob story, but when the cataclysm flooded Menethil Harbor, our house went with it. My wife and kids don't have a place to stay, and I need to make as much money as I can to get us under a roof again.I've been skinning crocs 'til I was too tired to move, but I still need more skins to sell. If you bring me some croc hides, I'll pay you a bit for them.25857I've been tempted to go after the big kill... the largest crocolisk out there, Horrorjaw. His hide alone would be enough to get my family out of this hole.But I'm no fool. One mistake and I could lose a leg, or my life, and then where would my wife and kids be? Still homeless and without a father to care for them.It's not my proudest moment, but I'll pick my family's safety over pride any day. Please, ... hunt Horrorjaw for me. You'll find him in his shady pool to the north, lurking.25858Lady Sira'kess has begun preparations for the ritual of summoning, but the Crucible of Nazsharin has been stolen from us. The Kvaldir have surely taken it with them as they retreated to shallower waters.Speak to the caste leaders to secure a war party, and then lead them in retrieving the artifact from Biel'aran Ridge to the east.I trust you my Battlemaiden, for you have never failed in any task that I have given you. As I am revered to the Queen, so are you revered to me. Go with my blessings.25859I know that you, like our revered lady, have unfortunate streaks of mercy that you succumb to at times.

I will cheer you on though, of course.25860We are to begin the ritual immediately, and you are to see to it that we are not interrupted.Slaughter any Kvaldir that enter the temple.

That won't be true for long, now will it?Clear out a good deal of Highland raptors, and I'll have a nice reward for you.25865You seem trustworthy enough to help me out with my real problem, . I was sent here by Ironforge to recover a shipment of gold ingots.The ingots are part of the Ironforge Royal Treasury, stamped with the royal seal... only an idiot would steal them for profit, far too easy to trace. Oddly enough, this area is full of idiots: Mosshide gnolls.I don't know how many gnolls you've fought before, but they're foul and brutal beasts, and dangerous. I need you to slay them and recover the missing ingots.25866You may have seen them while you were out, but the Dark Iron clan has been spotted in this area. They're never up to any good, and it looks like they're kidnapping the Mosshide gnolls for some reason.I don't know what their game is, but we're putting a stop to this before more foul play occurs. Go and stop them.And if you're worried about fairness, try askin' them politely first and see how far that gets you.25867I know we were just attacking the gnolls ourselves, but I'm not about to let the Dark Iron capture them as slaves. For one, we found the thieves and took back what was missing, so justice is served; for another, whatever work the Dark Iron will be putting them to isn't something I want to allow.Either way, the gnolls need to be freed. The trappers should have keys on them, so use those to open the cages.25868I've found out who's pulling the strings on this operation here. Yorla Darksnare is directing the Dark Iron dwarves from a camp to the east, and it might've been orders to have the gnolls steal Ironforge's gold in the first place.What's more, she's a wanted criminal... she's been inciting rebellion and attacks against Ironforge since Magni was still alive.She can't slip through our fingers this time, .

Why Nespirah would submit to the naga, however, is beyond my understanding.We can enter Nespirah's body cavity through a small tube near the exit to this cave.

The trade lanes aren't far, so there might be a chance of success, but I'm wary to let anyone get their hopes up.In truth, we don't have any other options. We're not likely to last much longer here. The naga will find us eventually, and... well... you saw how many of them there were.You should go find the two of them on Biel'aran Ridge to the southeast. I'll keep everyone here safe as long as I can.25894Hexascrub came out here with a balloon of some sort that he retrieved from one of our ships. He tried to float it to the top, but those Muckskin Scroungers came out of nowhere and swarmed the thing.He's got an idea for another balloon, but we need to make sure that the past doesn't repeat itself. I need you to kill off those gill goblins. Or at the very least, enough of them to make them a bit more wary of us.25895We must always come prepared. Prepared with gear. Prepared with plans. Prepared with gear plans!All of the ships in all of the Alliance fleets stow a survival kit. A lot of our tools came from a survival kit. My balloon came from a survival kit too! But now it's gone. I need another survival kit!There's a ship to the southeastish. Let's hope that the survivors were dumb and didn't take the survival kit. More survival kit for us!25896Ah, Battlemaiden. You carry with you the word and the will of our Lady. I might ask a favor of you...I need Fathom-Caller Azrajar and my Tide Priestesses to return so that we can begin the ritual. Can you carry my will to them as such? You should find them spread upon the temple terrace. Azrajar will be at the stairs to the north.25897Survival kits never have any rope. It makes no sense! No sense at all.I bet those Kvaldir have rope. They're always riding around in boats, tying knots, dressing in nets. Go take some rope from them! I must have it for our plan to work. Absolutely must.25898All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Fortuitous.Jorlan already swam up to catch it. Swam up and stopped to wait for it. He said you'd get the honors though. Jorlan's nice like that.Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Alliance ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.25899The fiery army that caused so much devastation up the hill has retreated east of here. Only the Scorchlords remain in action. If we can punch a hole through their lines to regroup with Captain Irontree's forces, the whole offensive may collapse., I'm in no shape to continue fighting, but you look like you can do some damage. Slay those Scorchlords and regroup with Captain Irontree!25900I can't believe that Nespirah would willingly allow these naga to take residence inside her shell.  As I see it, one of two things has happened: they have convinced her to willingly join their cause, or they have weakened her to a point where she cannot fight back.  Either one is bad.Here in this chamber, I should be able to communicate directly with Nespirah.  Let us find out for ourselves.  Speak to me when you are prepared, .25901Reinforcements! I thought we were going to fight this out to the bitter end.Very few of the Guardians of Hyjal remain, and our supplies are running out. The battlefield around our holdout here must be littered with serviceable arrows.I know it's beneath your abilities, but can you gather up our spent ammunition? It's the only way we can replenish our supplies!25904My Nemesis. Still lives.The servants of fire still come.We must pursue. Into their den.The ogres know the way.Slay the Field Captains.Recover the Glyph of Opening.This is the way.25905The rams we raise and train here at Amberstill ranch have long been the mounts of choice for Dun Morogh's mountaineers. Aye, there're a few here, but not enough to guard my family and all the animals.A few brave Frostmane raiders have taken to stealing our rams under the cover of night, taking them south into the Tundrid Hills. Would you be willing to help return them? You'll need to get fairly close to them and give a sharp whistle to get their attention. Their training will take over from there.25906Memorize the glyph.Take it within yourself.Draw it on the ground before the flamegate.East of here.Enter the Firelands.I cannot come with you.But my children await. Inside.Find Garunda Mountainpeak within the realm of flame.25907It will take me some time to break through this barrier and communicate with Nespirah.  In the meantime, you can save some of those men that the naga have enslaved in the pits below.This should come in handy.25908I may be unable to communicate directly with the beast Nespirah, but I can still feel some things indirectly.  For example, I can clearly sense that Nespirah is not happy about the naga's presence here.When we first entered Nespirah's body, I saw dozens of sentinels and enchantresses patrolling the central chamber floor.  Perhaps some of the ancient one's pain will be alleviated if you remove them.25909Everything in my body tells me that Nespirah is trying to speak with me, but I cannot hear her.  Perhaps the naga have done something to her voice.Nespirah's voice may be suppressed... that means... we need to find a voice for her!I've got it!  The Idra'kess have been known to train deepseeker crabs as battle companions.  Use this net to capture a crab, and bring it to me.  You will likely find them prowling the chamber's outer edges.25910This cavern is an abomination, . And it's filled with horrors from the depths.I don't want any of these - things - getting through the portal to the outside world. Slay everything!25911They'll probably send a skiff over, which may take a bit. I'll stay here to make contact.You need to return to the cave immediately and let them know that rescue is on its way. We can only hope that the naga have not found them yet.Go. Swim fast, .25912The world is unraveling around us, . Old enemies seek to destroy us from one end, while ancient forces close in on the other.I have seen better days - brighter days, and I long for them...Across Stonetalon Peak lies the ruins of our old outpost - now overrun with darkness. If you happen to go that way, could you search for my sketch book? It holds many happy memories. I would reward you well for its return.25913As the Horde were marching upon Stonetalon, I noticed that some of the sentinels had fallen ill. Not long after, they started acting strangely. When the first tentacle burst from the ground the ill sentinels began attacking us. We lost the outpost shortly after...The sentinels in the peak are now nothing more than shells - husks for something far more sinister. I want you to put the sentinels to rest and retrieve their glaives. Each glaive returned can identify a fallen sister.25914Tendrils are bursting forth from the earth and terrorizing Stonetalon Peak. My sentinels are hardly making a dent in their numbers.I suspect that there is a force at the heart of Stonetalon Peak that controls the tendrils. Perhaps if we can put a stop to that force, the tendrils will return to the depths from whence they came!25915The dark usurper Nemesis fled here when the fires of Hyjal receded. We are not yet strong enough to defeat Nemesis, , but we may be able to turn his own strength against him.I will send a child of Tortolla with you, one of the children you freed earlier from the Twilight's corruption.Search the depths of this cave for a Nemesis Crystal, and allow the young turtle to examine it.See me if you lose your companion!25916A trained shaman has the ability to communicate with the four elements of earth, fire, air and water.  This is known.What is not as widely known, however, is the presence of a fifth element.  This element is not as clearly described as the other four, but it has to do with the shared... commonality between all living creatures.My theory is that the crab, as a creature of the sea, is close enough to Nespirah that, with the elements' coaxing, we can convince it to act as Nespirah's mouthpiece.25917Nespirah has just informed me that we are not the only people fighting inside of this shell.  A small group of Alliance slaves has escaped and is currently fighting off the naga on the other side of the shell, up on the ledge that overlooks Nespirah's heart.Go find them, , and see what help they can lend us.  With their aid, we may be able to rouse Nespirah from her torpor.I will remain here, should you need anything.25918I honestly don't know how we've survived this long.  The naga took my armor and weapons, and left me with rags and a mining pick... and THAT snapped in half long ago.If we're to stand any hope of turning the tide, I'm going to need something to fight with... as will my companions, though they may be too proud to admit it.I've seen weapon racks in the naga storage areas nearby.  I'm not accustomed to fighting with a trident, but it'll sure be better than fighting with my fists.25919I see.  So the creature wants our help waking it up, is that it?With hundreds of slaves already picking away at her pearls, the beast seems to be a pretty heavy sleeper.  You might have better luck, though.My suggestion?  Look around the creature's flesh for signs of weakness.  Maybe that weapon of yours will find a ticklish spot and force the beast to come to its senses.25920My time in the pearl pits, however short, has made me curious about the naga's goals.  Yes, I now know that the naga want to use Nespirah as an engine of war, but if that's the case, then why are they enslaving men to mine her pearls?Assuming we escape this creature's hull, I would very much like to study these objects.  The pearls we found in the pits were much too large to carry, but I've seen the warlords and prophets occasionally carrying around smaller ones.25921My men are flagging, .  We won't last much longer against these naga, I'm afraid.  With the Idra'kess' weapons, and Nespirah's pearls, we should be ready to bust out of here.Follow the wall to the southeast, and look for a ramp to the upper chamber.  I assume their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening.  Hopefully both.If you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers.25922Thanks to you and the Captain, Nespirah has full control of her body... but most of the naga don't know this yet.  Once we make our escape, she will activate her biological defenses and destroy the naga from within.Make yourself ready... I will now tell Nespirah to begin the countdown.25923Your turtle companion can use this newfound power to render the two of you invulnerable for a short period of time. You can \"turtle up\" to avoid the worst of Nemesis and his fury. To do so, simply invoke this totem.This is all I can do for you. Together, you and a Child of Tortolla must defeat Nemesis, once and for all. Finish the Usurper!Return to me if you lose your turtle friend.25924Listen up, !A new landmass has emerged off the coast of Eastern Kingdoms and we are engaged in a critical battle for control of the island!Victory there will leave Stormwind completely defenseless!Now is the time to strike!Report to the docks at once for transport to the battle.Every warship is engaged, so you'll be boarding a mercenary vessel commissioned by the Warchief himself.25925We must attempt to establish communication with Farwatcher Glen, to the south. Our Darnassian glaive throwers are at your disposal, . Use them to cut a swath through the encroaching Horde forces and clear a path to Farwatcher Glen.I only hope we're not too late to save the Glen. Should Farwatcher Glen be intact, find Hierophant Malyk and inform him of our status.25926The mirebeasts to the west are not my brethren... they are symptoms of the earth's disturbance, a foulness of rot given form.You would not understand... they take the shape of my kind, infested within with decaying spores, forcing out flourished life in the swamp. They take all and leave only rot. Nothing left, nothing left!Soothe my mind, . Slay the mirebeasts, cleanse the land, and perhaps my mind will settle.25927Flame has threatened me for far too long... far too long... but it is no longer the little ones, no longer mere gnats...The fields burn! The hills and highlands scream, , they scream. The elementals brought here consume all life in their wake.They cannot stand, they cannot stand. Stop them. STOP THEM! Destroy the bringers of flame...25928I'll escort the children of Tortolla out of here and seal up this accursed portal.I'll leave it to you to inform Tortolla of our victory. Simply step back through the flamegate. The ancient will be pleased!25929Greetings, . I am Erunak, a fellow survivor of this savagery.I'm afraid your travails have only just begun. The naga have been scouring these waters, attacking anyone that still lives.You are not yet equipped to survive here, but I can remedy that.Just outside this ship live a special breed of starfish. Bring me some of them along with a conch shell. I'll prepare an enchantment that should help you grow accustomed to your environment.25930I am told that before the great upheaval the Charred Vale was a valley, closed off to the sea. One has merely to look to the south to see that the Charred Vale is no longer a valley and in fact has become an area of great volcanic activity.Salsbury here has configured a device that will allow us to ascend the volcano. Use it to get to the top and assess the goings on.I will keep in touch with this Gnomecorder device, which Salsbury has so kindly gifted upon me.25931Be very careful, . You do not want to rouse that black dragon.Now, look around you. If this is a nest then there must be black dragon eggs nearby. Search the premises for eggs and destroy any that you see.Return to me should you find and destroy Seldarria's eggs.Goldrinn watch over you.25932The reports I'm sending Captain Tharran can't really convey the amount of trouble the Frostmanes have created for us. Your assault on the village has started to relieve some of the pressure. The raids are still frequent, but the trolls don't have the numbers they once did.Even so, my men are tired and their morale is flagging. Would you help us keep watch for the Frostmane raiders? They could turn up at any time.25933Thank you again for all your help here, .I have a cousin who used to work in the mines beneath the Gol'Bolar Quarry, but he hasn't been able to work since troggs flooded into the mines and took control. The quarry and its camp are just to the southeast of the ranch. Would you be willing to check in with the foreman there and see if there's anything to be done?25934Good day, citizen, allow me to introduce myself. I am Salsbury, soon to be the world's first gnomegen. Malyk has assured me that as soon as my work here is complete he will grant me the gift of the worgen.So with the introduction out of the way, I've a request!Within the Charred Vale, south of here, roam newly created fire elementals. I desperately need a rare blazing heart of fire from one of the fiends. Get it for me and you bring me one step closer to becoming a gnomegen!25935Ah, a new arrival! Good that you're here ! The pups are hungry and we're completely out of food.Thankfully they love dragon meat, which fortuitously exists in abundance within the Charred Vale, south of here.Be a good  and fetch me several pounds of black dragon whelp filet.25936You are now able to move about this realm more freely and without fear of drowning.This is where our work begins.First, you have many allies nearby who are drowning as we speak. As I saved you, you must save them.I have enchanted the shell you brought me. Use it to rescue your friends.Hurry now!25937Mining wasn't the only thing going on in the quarry, you know. I led a team of Explorers' League excavators recovering priceless ancient artifacts.I managed to escape, but my colleagues were much deeper in the mine and didn't survive the initial trogg attack.They took great pride in their work and they risked their lives to learn more of our history. If you're going into the mines, take this pick with you and see if you can find anything in the digs the prospectors started.25938I've received a disturbing message from Nijel's Point in Desolace. It would seem as if the great upheaval has created some new problems for them, which they are ill-equipped to handle. I was given no further information.Report to Office Jankie in Desolace. She will direct you to Nijel's Point.Good luck, .25939The elementals rampaging across Direforge Hill are setting the very land beneath them ablaze. In a marsh such as this, fire can find many places to smoulder through the deep moss and peat.You must quench the fires before they spread further. Take this flower... blessed by nature's rain, it will let you douse the fires.The blossom may also prove useful against the elementals themselves.25940We might have a chance to beat these flames back thanks to your work in the Inferno.Still, more wildlife is threatened. Keeper Taldros ran north through the flames, to Whistling Grove.See if you can help him!25941You have done well, , but there is much more to do and I grow weary.I have expended a great deal of energy sending a distress message to Earthen Ring leadership, pleading for their help.I must rest if I am to be of further use to us here.Speak to the leader of the men you've saved and do what you can to help them prepare for battle.The naga are scouring the waters for us. It is but a matter of time before they return - and they will surely come in even greater force.25942Many good warriors have been lost today.If what the shaman says is true, then we must act swiftly or we will add to their numbers.The naga are out there, scouring these waters looking for survivors.We are not yet ready to fight, . You must buy us time to make preparations.Find the naga that hunt us and delay their efforts.25943I'll need your help if I am to get these orcs ready for battle.Any worthy leader knows that his warriors travel and fight on their stomachs. No food, no victory.These warriors are weary from their struggle out there. They need food before they're ready to overcome a naga attack.Speaking of traveling on stomachs, I saw plenty of crabs out on the sea floor...25944As we struggled not to drown, my orcs and I were forced to abandon our weapons and much of our armor.Erunak says to expect a major attack from the naga soon and I believe him.If we're going to be victorious, we'll need your help to recover our lost equipment.You should find it scattered around the sea floor near our shipwrecks here and to the north.Make haste, . The enemy could arrive at any moment.25945You're in Hellscream's army now, , and in Hellscream's army we kick butt and take names. Gone are the days of our people starving in the streets of Orgrimmar as we sign treaties with elves. We take what we need now. Kalimdor belongs to the Horde!The Alliance attempts to stop our expansion every chance they get. Unsatisfied with owning most of the Eastern Kingdoms, those pig-lickers want it all!Overlord Krom'gar has called for more troops in Stonetalon. Get on the caravan west of here and go!25946This helm and its associated components are marked with the seal of Stormwind. It was no doubt cast off from an Alliance ship that suffered a similar fate to yours.Looking closer, this seems far too intricate and sturdy to be everyday diving equipment. Perhaps Nazgrim can make some sense of this...25947I recognize this helm, . You were wise to bring it to me.The Alliance have a special unit, trained and equipped to explore and fight beneath the sea.It would seem that they are in this region to do more than just defend against our attack.There must be more of these down here, and if you can find them it could turn things around for the Vanguard.25948It is time, .We are as ready as we ever will be!I shall address the Vanguard, and then we shall swim into the sea to meet our fate.25949The time has come to make our stand, .We'll defend this ship to our last breath, and make these naga scum think twice before approaching it again!For the Horde!25950You're the  everyone's been talking about? Good to meet ya, love. Let's have a butcher's hook.Well, enough rabbit, right? Let's get down to it. I need you to swim out northwest to the Sira'kess Front and read and write them snakes something quick.Nothing fancy. They're looking for a bother, and we'll give 'em a right good one in the ol' boat race.25951Get to the bridge on the east, quickly. Lady Naz'jar and the Fathom-Lord should be there with whatever forces remain.Follow our Lady's direction, as always. Hold the bridge until we can complete the ritual.Once our allies arrive, the Kvaldir will be doomed.25952Our escape from the shell can't have gone unnoticed, but either the naga at these ruins weren't informed or they don't consider us a threat. I don't intend to take the opportunity for granted - we strike now.I need you to slip into the lower level of the ruins to our west and take out as many of their patrols as you can. We cannot risk any of those patrols finding out about our occupation of this cave - make sure none escape.25953I've taken the liberty of performing some preliminary scouting. The naga may not be aware of our position, but they are not entirely unprepared for intruders.Beyond their patrols, they have set up magical sentry devices that will warn them of unwelcome guests. Fortunately, they seem to have sacrificed quality for quantity, and there is definitely a window in which the devices can be destroyed before their alarms are answered.I trust that you can see to this before our other soldiers arrive.25954Look-- is it?--I need your help. I know most everyone in this cave thinks that we're not in a position to be worrying about anything but our own hides right now, but I cannot dismiss my ancestors so readily.This was one of the royal cities of the elves in the days when Azshara was queen. In this city lie the keys to lore long lost and artifacts of unimaginable historical value. All I want from you, while you're out in the city proper, is to keep a watchful eye out for objects of significance.25955This cave is our only refuge. There's no help on the way. Whatever happens, this cave must remain safe or we are all sure to die down here.We need a forward post to launch our attacks from. Something defensible.In the eastern portion of the ruins on the lowest level, scout the north end of the gardens, the passage leading under the main structure just west of the gardens, and the cluster of buildings at the southeast corner of the ruins, under the bridges.Bring me back any information you can.25956All around you lie the remnants of a fierce battle. The naga skeletons are no surprise, but the weapons and remains of their apparent opponents are somewhat more unexpected.Amidst the bones, you spot a strangely prominent piece of metal jutting out from one of the skulls. It's difficult to tell what sort of weapon it might have once been part of, but it stands out sufficiently to prompt you to retrieve it as evidence.Surely someone back at the cave would be interested in this revelation.25957The shard you recovered looks to be of naga origin. I had hoped to find a strong focal object like this for a spell I've been working on that would allow us to glimpse into the recent past.I've enchanted the blade, but you'll have to take it to a place where we know its owner was. I want you to travel back to the site where you found it and use the blade.Perhaps we can uncover more behind what the naga are doing here. Or even better, maybe we'll uncover a weakness that will give us a better chance.25958The Captain used the information you gathered for him to make a forward post under the terrace to our west. He's been preparing there for some kind of attack against the naga.You should go to him immediately and inform him of the scope of what you've witnessed. Our force is small, and I fear for our soldiers if we charge in too recklessly.Take my sea horse. It knows the way.25959I see. The news you bring is grim, but I was not entirely unprepared for such possibilities. Without any effective scouting of naga numbers, I knew our plan was risky, but that's why we established this forward post.Let me put it to you plainly, . If we do not keep the naga off-balance, they will bring the fight to us. We do not have the structures or the men to mount a defense, so that is not an option.We need more time. Can you thin their numbers to the south, under the far terrace?25960I overheard your conversation with the Captain. I know what we're doing sounds insane, but we really don't have much choice. There are people back at that cave that are depending on us.I've stationed lookouts on various ledges in the immediate area. They're burning ammo fast on the scattered naga scouts. Bring them more crossbow bolts to buy us some extra time.25962Been all over the place. Blown all kinds of things up. I thought I might have some trouble carrying on the trend, what with the water and all, but it's all just a matter of inspiration.I found something volatile enough to make bombs out of! There's a bunch of kelp hanging under the terrace to the southwest. Normally kelp stores gas that makes it float - this kelp produces a different kind of heavy gas. It keeps it hanging, but also makes for great explosions.Gather me some?25963We have everything we need to begin the attack.If your claims were correct, you would do well to make sure you cling tight to your mount as we make the run. Anyone who gets caught in the open water isn't likely to out-swim a naga.Kill as many as you can as we make the attack run and we'll rendezvous on the broken ledge of the southern terrace above once we've expended our explosives. Hopefully by that point there will be few enough that we can finish them off the old-fashioned way.25964That was a disaster! Most of our men went down to spears before making it anywhere near the rendezvous.We're only going to be able to hold this position for so long before the naga overrun us. We need to get out there to the southwest and save as many of the men as we can find - do anything you can.They won't last long. Please hurry!25965Vicious louts... they did a lot of damage with those spears.We'll hold here as long as we can for all the men to make it. I need someone to scout their numbers to see how much damage we did.One of the biggest groups of them was around the corner on the northwest portion of this round terrace, and the other was a bit farther to the north in the small tunnel, also on this middle level of the ruins.Up for some scouting?25966Look, I know this is asking a lot during a time like this, but I need you to tear yourself away from this defeat for a moment.I will tend to these soldiers - you need to find the location of that battle with the Kvaldir General to the west that you told me about. You should be able to glimpse more of the Battlemaiden's experiences from there. I have a strong feeling that the key to defeating these naga will lie with that Battlemaiden.Please hurry - I will do everything I can to buy you time.25967You'll have to catch me up more later. Right now, we need to get out of here before more naga push in. Make your way back to the forward post on the level below us.Take my sea horse. We will meet you back there shortly.25968Toldrek and Fiasco left to find a way to contact help. The trade lanes aren't far, so there might be a chance of success, but I'm wary to let anyone get their hopes up.In truth, we don't have any other options. We're not likely to last much longer here. The naga will find us eventually, and... well... you saw how many of them there were.You should go find the two of them on Biel'aran Ridge to the southeast. I'll keep everyone here safe as long as I can.25969Fiasco came out here with a balloon of some sort that he retrieved from one of our ships. He tried to float it to the top, but those Muckskin Scroungers came out of nowhere and swarmed the thing.He's got an idea for another balloon, but we need to make sure that the past doesn't repeat itself. I need you to kill off those giblins. Or at the very least, enough of them to make them fear us.25970It's a short swim to the top. Not much trouble really. Hard to get any supplies up there though. Too heavy.All of the ships in all of the Horde fleets stow a survival kit. I had a balloon from the old survival kit, but it fell on hard times recently. I need another survival kit.There's a ship to the southeastish. Let's hope that the survivors were dumb and didn't take the survival kit. More survival kit for us.25971Survival kits never have any rope. It makes no sense! Rope and bombs, that's all they should store. The rest of this stuff is just a waste of space.Except maybe the balloon. That's coming in handy right now.I bet those Kvaldir have rope. They're always riding around in boats, tying knots, dressing in nets. Go take some rope from them! I must have it for our plan to work. It is non-optional.25972All done! I'm confident it will work. And not a scrounger in sight to pop a hole in it this time! Well played.Toldrek already swam up to catch it, all concerned about currents and what not. He said you'd get the honors though. Nice guy - don't know how he lasts.Go to the top with the balloon, take the flare gun from the crate, and scan the horizon for Horde ships. If you see any, fire the flare towards them. That's it! All there is to it.Swim. Float. Flare. Rescue! That last part's my favorite.25973They'll probably send a skiff over, which may take a bit. I'll stay here to make contact.You need to return to the cave immediately and let them know that rescue is on its way. We can only hope that the naga have not found them yet.Go. Swim fast, .25974So, you're the  everyone's been talking about? It's good to finally meet you.Well, enough talk, right? Let's get down to it. I need you to swim out northwest to the Sira'kess Front and kill those naga real quick.Nothing fancy. They're looking for a fight, and we'll give them one! Well, you will.25975We've got our reinforcements, but we still need to find a way to pay them. That kind of action doesn't come cheap.Up on Deepfin Ridge to the northwest, the slimy gilblin have stolen all sorts of treasure. I think that it's time to reclaim some of it for the cause.25976Blood and thunder! We have our reinforcements, but they still need to be paid.

Not that they've got any nutmegs mind you.25978Khurgorn tells me the cataclysm upset the balance of the elements all over the world. Helm's Bed Lake, to the south, used to be beautiful and tranquil, but it is now overrun with agitated water elementals. When they started to leave the confines of the lake, I sent my troops in to keep them busy, but most have been frozen in blocks of ice.If we can break them free, they have a good chance of recovering. I cannot spare the men for a second expedition out onto the lake. Would you be willing to try?25979The elements are in turmoil, . The cataclysm stirred up the long-dormant water spirits of Helm's Bed Lake, just to the south. They're angry, confused, and unwilling to hear my pleas.I have tried everything I know to calm them, to persuade them to stop lashing out and attacking the sergeant's mountaineers.It pains me to say this, but no other options remain -- we must kill the elementals.25980, the naga are after our forces.

Perhaps the naga have done something to her voice.Nespirah's voice may be suppressed... that means... we need to find a voice for her!I've got it!  The Idra'kess have been known to train deepseeker crabs as battle companions.  Use this net to capture a crab, and bring it to me.  You will likely find them prowling the chamber's outer edges.25990A trained shaman has the ability to communicate with the four elements of earth, fire, air and water.  This is known.What is not as widely known, however, is the presence of a fifth element.  This element is not as clearly described as the other four, but it has to do with the shared... commonality between all living creatures.My theory is that the crab, as a creature of the sea, is close enough to Nespirah that, with the elements' coaxing, we can convince it to act as Nespirah's mouthpiece.25991Nespirah has just informed me that we are not the only people fighting inside of this shell.  A small group of Horde slaves has escaped and is currently fighting off the naga on the other side of the shell, up on the ledge that overlooks Nespirah's heart.Go find them, , and see what help they can lend us.  With their aid, we may be able to rouse Nespirah from her torpor.I will remain here, should you need anything.25992I honestly don't know how we've survived this long.  The naga took my armor and weapons, and left me with rags and a mining pick... and THAT snapped in half long ago.If we're to stand any hope of turning the tide, I'm going to need something to fight with... as will my companions, though they may be too proud to admit it.I've seen weapon racks in the naga storage areas nearby.  I'm not accustomed to fighting with a trident, but it'll sure be better than fighting with my fists.25993I see.  So the creature wants our help waking it up, is that it?With hundreds of slaves already picking away at her pearls, the beast seems to be a pretty heavy sleeper.  You might have better luck, though.My suggestion?  Look around the creature's flesh for signs of weakness.  Maybe that weapon of yours will find a ticklish spot and force the beast to come to its senses.25994My time in the pearl pits, however short, has made me curious about the naga's goals.  Yes, I now know that the naga want to use Nespirah as an engine of war, but if that's the case, then why are they enslaving men to mine her pearls?Assuming we escape this creature's hull, I would very much like to study these objects.  The pearls we found in the pits were much too large to carry, but I've seen the warlords and prophets occasionally carrying around smaller ones.25995My men are flagging, .  We won't last much longer against these naga, I'm afraid.  With the Idra'kess' weapons, and Nespirah's pearls, we should be ready to bust out of here.Follow the wall northeast, and look for a ramp to the upper chamber.  I assume their leader is in there, or perhaps the key to Nespirah's awakening.  Hopefully both.If you feel strong enough, head up to the top of the shell and look for some answers.  Hellscream's eyes are upon you!25996Thanks to you and the Legionnaire, Nespirah has full control of her body... but most of the naga don't know this yet.  Once we make our escape, she will activate her biological defenses and destroy the naga from within.Make yourself ready... I will now tell Nespirah to begin the countdown.25997A cadre of Dark Iron spies have taken over Ironband's Compound to the south, beyond Helm's Bed Lake.

We're gonna need to ward you against the tower's defenses. To do that, we're gonna need some gems the Boulderfist shaman have taken a liking to. They took 'em from the tower, but they're not gonna stay in their possession for long.Get one of them gems an' bring 'em to Kryten--he knows the spell to enchant it.26038Here's what you're looking for: Trelane's phylactery, Trelane's orb, and Trelane's ember agate.All three should be in chests within the tower.  You shouldn't have a problem opening the chests on your own; you just have to be careful of the ogres.You'll need to have your weapons at the ready.

I'm choosing the third option, do nothing. So far, so good.You need parts? Plenty from the left over junk scattered about in this mine. You just gotta go get 'em.Good luck! Maybe if you get those parts we might be able to show our faces at Krom'gar Fortress.26046Dontrag can explain it better than me. Basically, we're stuck between a rock and a hard place. Can't do anything down here due to all of the things that can kill us and can't go back to the base due to all of the things that can kill us - you know?Perhaps if we worked together we might be able to get this mess sorted out. How about you get started by clearing out some of these elementals that have apparently killed everything in the mine, ok?26047These two are USELESS! When they first arrived I thought we were saved. Not so! Instead, Dontrag and Utvoch took one look at the mine and concocted some idiotic plan that involved standing here until... until we all died, I guess. You don't look nearly as useless. How about you lend a hand, friend? I've got dozens of peons, scared out of their gourds, hiding in the Deep Reaches. Find them and get them out!26048Whew, that was tough.

Find one and recover its beating heart!26061If I am to invoke voodoo, I will need several special reagents. Bring me horns from the Stonetalon rams of the region, ! Without the horns we are done for!26062The final ingredient for the voodoo ritual is a special type of crystal called resonite. It can only be found in the Boulderslide caverns, west of here.

The cold it emanates will cause major shrinkage on those monsters and then you'll be able to destroy them.26066It would appear as if we are running out of big, stupid orcs to send at the enemy. This is a problem. Thankfully, I may have a solution.Take this whip and head west to Boulderslide Cavern. Within the cave you will find a filthy nest of kobolds. Use my whip to subdue the beasts. Once subdued they will do whatever we ask them to do.Return to me when you have amassed a sizable army of kobolds.26067Ah, it is done!

Our scouts in Battlescar Valley report that the night elves are preparing their own weapon of mass destruction and hiding it within an ancient tree. They will never be given the chance to use their weapon against us.You are to escort the bomb to the Sludgewerks for refueling and then to Cliffwalker Post, from which we will detonate the bomb and kill all of our enemies.Go now, . Report to Jibbly Rakit when you arrive at the Sludgewerks.26075We have a little problem...We built the Sludgewerks near a wyvern habitat.

He has assured me that he will bring back proof that the night elves do not harbor a weapon of mass destruction. We shall see.While we await this proof, you will assist our army in the valley. We have prepared a large number of siege tanks for this purpose. Our demolishers are poised for attack.Take the elevator down to the base of the outpost and take control of a Krom'gar demolisher.

Now that we've made our mark, the next phase of our conquest will occur over months rather than minutes.There is much work yet to be done, and I will spare you the tedium of waiting for our fortifications to trickle in. Travel to the east, to Hammerfall. The orcs there will no doubt have use of your aid.26085While our engineers work on getting the bombers ready to fly again, our guards and mountaineers continue to fight the invaders.They've been out there since the incursion began, without so much as a chance to catch some sleep or have a meal. Ironforge's defenders are among the best on Azeroth, but even they have limits.Take these banners and plant them in banks of loose snow. Remind the men what they are fighting for and help keep their morale high.26086Where is that hunter?  I sent Orako to Underlight Canyon to prepare a recon report a week ago!  Sure, he's a handful, and I didn't mind getting him out of my hair, but I need his report.Say, what's your name?  ?  Would you be willing to go track him down?  It seems strange to send a  to find a hunter, but I'm running out of options.26087Shooting fish in a barrel is easy.  Shooting fish in an ocean is a little harder.Have you seen the murlocs down in the canyon, ?  They don't shoot at all!  They have little balls full of glow-juice on their heads that make the fish come to THEM.  Hey, we should try that!Go south, and kill the crabs and groupers in the canyon.  They have lots of glow-juice in their skin.  I've seen it!26088Here, I got you this hat.  It has a light on it, and it will make fish follow you.

We must reclaim the land for ourselves before the Horde has a chance to creep further.26094My chief engineer tells me that he's managed to get one of the bombers repaired and airworthy. Take these bombs with you, and look for the repaired bomber at the start of the runway.Once you're airborne, use the bombs to do as much damage to the attacking Dark Iron dwarves as you can. I've heard rumors that they're preparing to deploy a new kind of war golem. Keep your eyes peeled for those golems and make them your highest priority targets.26095The Syndicate in Stromgarde do battle with our contingent of militia there. In order to urge the rabble to fight our more disciplined troops, the Syndicate leaders have placed a bounty on our soldiers, awarding gold for each Stromgarde Badge gathered off killed militiamen.We want those badges retrieved - we cannot allow the cutthroats to take trophies from our brave fallen!Enter the Syndicate-controlled area of Stromgarde and hunt them for our badges.26096We think that we have a use for the merciless ones that your friend from the cave delivered to us. But I need a preservative for it.Down below in the Scalding Chasm are some mushrooms with the properties that I need. Bring some back up to me and I'll see what I can do.26097At the heart of Battlescar Valley stands an ancient tree - a tree that has withstood the force of ages and has served as a place of peace and learning for generations. My kin have studied druidism at the grove, alongside the night elves, for as long as I can recall. Now I am to believe that the tree holds within it an Alliance weapon of mass destruction?Krom'gar is wrong and I will prove it!I have sent my son, Orthus, to Thal'darah Grove in search of this weapon. Go there now and meet him.26098Druid corpses litter the room. Something seems amiss, as you see no signs of a struggle.  Bloody drag marks lead in from the doorway.You pry Orthus' death grip open to find something disturbing in his hand: a Krom'gar General's insignia.Take the Krom'gar General's insignia back to High Chieftain Cliffwalker.26099He was a good boy, . Young, loving. He would have never killed any of the young druids. They were his friends! No... Not Orthus.The General must be called to answer for this crime.

Together we will end this nonsense.26102With you leading the way, we've finally broken the momentum of the Dark Iron attack. General Grimaxe, the Dark Iron leader, is attempting to rally his troops from the center of their lines on the frozen lake to the south.He stands atop one of their new dark iron golems, shouting orders to his men. If he succeeds in rallying them, they may still be able to overpower us. You must prevent that, . Destroy the golem guarding him, then kill General Grimaxe himself. He is the key to our victory.26103Submarine fuel is expensive!The powers-that-be in Gnomeregan were generous enough to deliver several fuel barrels, but we're burning through it faster than expected.  That means we're going to need to improvise.It's a well-known fact that sea creatures are full of all kinds of interesting chemicals... like oil.  Take this device up to Kothrun's End and stick it into the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  If we don't get more submarine fuel, their oil might be our only hope.26105The Horde has spies in this area?  Darkbreak Cove is nearby, and inside lies the Pincer X2!

Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done.26107Our race's gift of shamanism stirred me from a years-long lethargy. Now I provide for all here, crafting the same boons that gave me newfound strength.The Highland raptors are cunning and fierce beasts. Their spirits can grant our warriors great strength. Bring me raptor eyes, so I may make the amulets as Tor'gan taught me.26108The highland fleshstalkers to the south are even fiercer than the others of their kind. They possess not just strength, but true cunning.When I was trapped by lethargy, even the amulets of strength failed to move me. But Tor'gan used the hearts of the fleshstalkers to imbue me with spirits that conquered my doubt, freeing me.Our soldiers deserve the guile of the raptor. Collect the fleshstalker hearts for me, .26110It's funny. Kin and I have been through so much together, and here we find ourselves back in Arathi, like so many years ago.We broke up a plot to create a new plague right here, her and I. It doesn't look like the Horde learned their lesson, because they're all over this farm yet again.Their undead courier is shuffling around as obvious as daylight. If you want to help, find the courier and bring back whatever they're carrying.26111I now imbue you with the energies of the corrupting faceless.Swim down to my luring totem in the trench to the northeast. Release the energies through it. Bring back the brain of their leader.Call forth to Ick'thys the Unfathomable... it will come!26112So just how did all those Dark Iron warriors end up here, on the doorstep of Ironforge, on the verge of invading our city?Does not 'Empress' Moira, a member of our esteemed Council of Three Hammers, rule the Dark Iron? This cannot have happened without her knowledge and consent. This was no ragtag band of rebel dwarves, but a well-organized and fully equipped invasion force.I have prepared a report on the battle for the airfield. Take it to Ironforge, to the High Seat and confront her!26113The Horde have held Go'shek Farm to the east for a long time; it's never been of much concern compared to the rest of our problems here. But there's been reports of undead activity in the area.Anything more alarming than shuffling peons over there warrants investigation. This isn't the first time the undead have been up to no good at the farm, so I've sent my best scouts there to check it out. Report to Quae and Kinelory and they'll fill you in.26114Expansion...control of territory... these undead aren't cooking up anything new, but they're planning to roll over all of Arathi. We need to disrupt their plans.I'll keep a lookout from up here. You go with Kin, and get those invasion plans. We're not going to let these walking corpses even know what day it is out here.And keep her safe, you hear me?26115Stand by me, , and watch as our mighty weapon destroys our enemies!Learn what it means to be Horde!26116All right, .

You obviously did a good job protecting her.Refuge Pointe will want to know of our success. I'm going to stay here with Kin and let her catch her breath. Go on ahead without us.26118The ambassador's betrayal will long haunt me. You must arrest him before he can do further harm, or worse, before he can escape and start planning the next attack. Ironforge is not safe with Ambassador Slaghammer free inside the city.Take these manacles and go to the Dark Iron embassy. It's just to the north of the High Seat, around the rim of the Great Forge. Arrest Ambassador Slaghammer and return with him.26120The Dragonmaw orcs nearby are fast becoming a nuisance. Their suicidal attacks on the grove are merely annoying, though they provide my sentinels with some needed practice.My scouts, however, have seen them rounding up black dragon whelps in nets. The last thing these lands need is a crude revival of dragon-taming. Strike out to the east, , and cut down the whelpstealers; make sure their folly does not come back to haunt us later.26121You are seeink spies up above?  This is not good... not good at all, comrade.Return to Korthun's End and destroy them, my friend.26122Have you ever smelled submarine fuel, ?  It's nasty stuff.  Unfortunately, we need to burn huge amounts of it to get the Verne to move, and it's both bad-smelling AND deadly to the local wildlife.  We need to be more environmentally conscious.The sea creatures nearby have particularly oily flesh.  Take this device up to Seabrush - just above this cave - and use it on the corpses of terrapins, remoras, and hammerhead sharks.  Their oil might save the lives of hundreds of other sea creatures.26124The Alliance has spies in this area?  Tenebrous Cavern is nearby, and inside lies the Horde's new submarine, the Verne!  The Alliance must not be allowed anywhere nearby!Someone in the cavern will want to hear of this incursion... after you finish slaying some more of these scheming Alliance spies.26125You saw spies up above?  This is not good... I won't have it.Return to Seabrush and get rid of them before they start trickling into our hideout.26126How much do you know about fuel, ?  Constructing the perfect fuel is a tricky job, as there's plenty of factors to balance: chrono-pyroxidation parameters, tempero-incendiary variables, conflagrational siltification criteria... and that's only naming a few.Hopefully the samples you brought me can be combined in the right proportions to create... the perfect bio-fuel.  Use that table over there and try combining some samples!  Bring the result to me when you're done.26127I and everyone else thought these fools were just Dark Iron up to no good, but these nutters are fullblown cultists!The Twilight's Hammer wants nothing short of the destruction of the entire world. They've thrown their lot in with Deathwing and Ragnaros, and they've got a history with the Dark Iron.But it doesn't matter who they are, what matters is they're in Dun Modr and they need to get out! I'll not let any past here. You get in there and crack some skulls!26128I've defended the Thandol Span from being destroyed before, against the Dark Iron themselves. And so did my father, and his father before him...The only Dark Iron that managed to give me the slip ran straight for the bridge. Something's amiss, and I'm betting when we get there we'll be waltzing right into an ugly trap.I could use your help, , for Ironforge. Are you with me?26129Listen, .  For the first time since the civil war I agree with Greymane.  Now is the time to put aside our quarrel.It sure doesn't look like these beasts care much whether you're a rebel or a royal.Send word back to Greymane.

It is being controlled and its life energies slowly consumed by something immense beneath us.There is a cave known as the Undershell down below L'ghorek. In that cave are three powerful ogre magi that are maintaining a ritual connecting the thing below with the ancient. You must kill these three to disconnect L'ghorek.26131I've been waiting for the council to hear my plea for hours, and it's not looking good. Moira's greatest desire seems to be to paralyze the council.Meanwhile, Loch Modan suffers. Our enemies are many and our resources are few. Please, , perhaps you will hear me if the council will not.

Once I have done that I will go to the bombing site and begin the process of regrowth. Perhaps one day a new grove will bloom - a grove infused with the spirit of my child and the fallen night elf youths.If you wish to travel to Desolace, I hear word of a blood elf named Furien seeking adventuring partners. Perhaps you should seek him out.Farewell, friend, I will never forget you.26135What you told me of the naga before has been plaguing my mind. Who are these allies they're summoning? Do they really think they can defeat the Tidehunter?Escaping this cave brings a degree of relief, but our purpose here remains. I'm hoping you will be willing to seek answers from the Battlemaiden one last time.There's only one place that I can think of where they would have taken the artifact - the temple atop the ruins. It's sure to be well guarded. Proceed carefully.26137I'm sure you've seen just how bad the damage to the Loch is by now. The damage spreads further than that, I'm afraid; all that water had to go somewhere, and it went down into the Wetlands.There's a lot of fine dwarves down there trying to help out, and they need supplies. That's why I sent two of my mountaineers ahead with a cask of ale along the path into the Wetlands.I haven't heard back from them since they set off down the road to Dun Algaz. Would you mind checking up on them?26138There's a group of night elves that call the wetlands home now.

THE CENTRAL TEMPLE. THEY WILL IGNORE... YOU. YOU ARE BENEATH... THEIR NOTICE.USE... THE ELEMENTAL'S POWERS... TO DESTROY... THE TWILIGHT DEVOTEES... AND... THEIR... FACELESS OVERSEERS.26157I need you to pass on a message for me.Kasim Sharim is an old blood mage that knows a great deal about the demons of the Blasted Lands.  Though you wouldn't know from looking at him, he's quite old, and very powerful... if a little eccentric.  As of late, he spends his days in the back of the Serpent's Coil, a cave not far from where you killed those cultists.Please, deliver this message to him.  He will know what it means.26158Did you have fun fighting your way to the back of this cave?  I admit, I haven't picked the most... convenient of spots to perform my studies, especially for passing adventurers who wish to enter and leave at will.However, I can allow you to attune yourself to my bloodstone teleporters.  Simply place your hands on the stone in the back corner, and you will be teleported outside of the cave.  Then use the stone outside to teleport back!26159Like any good bloodmage, I perform my magic with blood.  All blood is different, and the Blasted Lands has several useful flavors, if you know where to look.For our purposes?  Basilisks and hyenas, even amounts.  We're going to need plenty of it.  Head west, to the center of the Blasted Lands.  And don't forget... you can use that teleporter!26160I suppose you want to know what we're doing.  Here's the short version - a version at which I happen to be an expert:The Shadowsworn cultists wish to summon the demon, Razelikh, back to the Blasted Lands.  We cannot allow this to happen.  So we're going to summon him ourselves, and then kill him.  A task not as simple as it sounds...Let me know when you are ready to begin the blood ritual, and then stand back.26161We need Loramus Thalipedes, the demon hunter.  He knows Razelikh's true name, and as you know: if you know the name of the demon, you have power over it.  The problem is that Loramus has been killed, and his body torn apart.If you bring me the pieces, we still have a recourse.  All three pieces are in the west... the Dreadmaul ogres hide them in their caves.  Move quickly, for much like Grimeo, Loramus also owes me a debt...26162Up on the bluffs to the west lies a powerful altar.  A powerful DEMONIC altar, guarded by cultists, but powerful nonetheless.  If you can reach it, you can use it to bring Loramus back to us.The altar will likely resist your efforts, so you'll have to protect Loramus' body while the ritual completes.  Bring the demon hunter back to me afterwards.26163Razelikh plans to return to the Blasted Lands and overwhelm Azeroth with his demons.  Even now, he is preparing to summon his legions to eliminate us.  With these three amulets, we have the method to summon him... but no way to destroy him.Deliver this to Grimeo at the Dark Portal, to the southeast.  He will guide you.  Quickly!  Time is short!  And so am I!26164Kasim wants you to gather granite chips from these chunks of rock around the Dark Portal.  I don't know what he'd want rocks for, but I have my suspicions, and they're not pleasant ones.Use this pick and look for small outcroppings of rock along the edge of the portal's blast radius.26165Sharim wants demon blood.  Speaking personally, the stuff does not even seem like blood to me - more like liquid rot - but that is of no consequence.Luckily for you, the area around the Dark Portal is crawling with demons.  Infernals, felhounds, felguards... they've all got what you need, in copious, pustulent amounts.26166That's all that the gnome asked of us.  When you see him, make sure you let him know that this task ends my debt.  I will not suffer his requests any longer.26167To summon our demon, we need three amulets, and the first is the Amulet of Allistarj.Allistarj himself is dead, but he locked his amulet up in a trove inside this very cave.  Along with the other amulets, this relic will give us access to Razelikh's perch.The amulet is close to the entrance.  I recommend using the teleporter.26168The second amulet, Sevine's amulet, is in the hands of a murloc, far to the south, on a shelf that overlooks the Shattershore.  How it ended up in that murloc's possession, I cannot say, but I can state with certainty that you will find it there.Bring her amulet to me, along with the rest.26169Grol... the ogre.It would seem that Grol's body no longer rests with the ogres.  His body, along with his amulet of power, is in a wrecked ship off the Shattershore, to the east.  His amulet is the last... once combined, the three will give us access to Razelikh, and therein lies our chance to stop his madness.26170The knife is ready.  Loramus is present, and he knows what he must do.  I must now take the three amulets and use their enchantment to grant you access to Razelikh, the amulets' creator.I am prepared to perform the ritual on you and Loramus.  Speak with me when you are both ready.26171Hero, listen well.First, we must travel to the Deathly Usher, who waits at the northern foot of the Rise of the Defiler, to our northwest.  The usher will take us to the top of the rise.  Once there, you will help me defeat Razelikh, for I fear I am not strong enough to defeat him alone.Most importantly, I need you to hold the stone knife, and do not use it until I tell you to.  The knife will trap Razelikh's soul within its new, eternal prison.If we succeed, speak with Grimeo, the draenei.26172Contrary to popular belief, ancient and powerful bloodmages do NOT drink blood.  We eat normal food like everybody else - something which can be hard to come by in the recesses of a hostile cultist stronghold.The ashmane boars in the central valley of the Blasted Lands are, if nothing else, convenient for eating, as their meat does not require any cooking.  Would you hunt these boars and help me replenish my ever-dwindling foodstores?26173The only reason you see me standing aside Horde soldiers is because our duty outweighs our enmity... however slightly.  We have been charged with protecting the Dark Portal from unauthorized travel, and with the recent cataclysm, we are particularly susceptible to an attack.  We've already heard reports of black dragons in the area...With my men focused on their duty, we need someone to keep the area demons in check.  Around the portal you will find three demon lieutenants.  Slay them.26174I have orders from... higher up... that you would be suitable for.  I've seen the Horde periodically referring to a stack of papers on that barrel over there.  I'd like you to take a look at those papers and find out what it is that they're plotting.  My duty and station prevent me from such a questionable task, but a newcomer like you might be able to slip in unnoticed...26175Other than what you've seen, the Portal's been surprisingly quiet.  There isn't much more work I can give to you, I'm afraid.If you're looking for trouble, you might try the Gilnean fishing village to the southwest.  Surwich, I think it was.I know we're supposed to be friends with the Gilneans, but really?  Worgen?  I had enough trouble getting used to the draenei.26176You've helped us quite a bit here. If you're leaving, I'd ask you to take this status report up to Thelsamar.Follow the road just north, and you can't miss it. Mountaineer Kadrell will want the report.26177Fresh crab legs have always been one of the King's favorite foods.  We have had good luck catching fresh crabs in the canals over the past few weeks.  Do you think you can lend me a hand and catch a few of them for me?  Be sure to catch them alive, they are no good to me dead, the King requires the freshest catch we can muster.26178We must move decisively against the wolvar if we're to have a chance of survival. However, I worry that in our zeal, too many of them will be slain.The Snowfall Glade wolvar have as much right to exist as do we. You and I will see to it that they get that chance.If Elder Ko'nani hasn't asked you already, he will ask you to deal with them.  While you're upon the glade to the north, I'd like you to bag up their pups and bring them back to me.26179This explains the buildup of Venture Co. employees and equipment we've seen in Mulgore. Those goblins... their company is expanding too quickly for their own good. It's how they say, show a goblin something, and you can hear the scales in the background.Greedy little things, they are. Unfortunately for their business enterprise, we tauren cannot allow them to conduct their operations in our lands. Go to their mine northeast of the ravaged caravan and send them a message.26180According to the documents you salvaged from the caravan, the Venture Co. created many plans to attempt to drive us from our lands here, so that they could have free reign to plunder our lands.The depths that they would sink to accomplish their goals disgusts and appalls me. I want the mastermind behind their plans killed. His name is Supervisor Fizsprocket, you will find him at the Venture Co. mine east of the ravaged caravan. Bring me his clipboard, we shall see if we find out anything useful.26181YOU MUST RETURN... TO... THE DARKBREAK COVE. ERUNAK STONESPEAKER AWAITS... YOU WITHIN.I DIE NOW....26182YOU MUST RETURN... TO... THE TENEBROUS CAVERN. ERUNAK STONESPEAKER AWAITS... YOU WITHIN.I DIE NOW....26183I am forever in debt to our King for all that he has done for us.  One thing I can do for him is make his favorite drink!  Lucky for us, the ingredients we need to make this wonderful drink are located right here in Stormwind City.  Apple trees can be found in every district of Stormwind.  These trees are too tall to pick the fruit from, but lucky for us the apples have fallen to the ground and are easy to retrieve.26184Not surprisingly, most of our citizens in Surwich did not come to the Blasted Lands for the pleasant atmosphere.  They came following the dream of an idealistic druid: Marl Wormthorn.  Wormthorn believed that the Tainted Scar could be healed, and attempted to grow it back.It looks like he was wrong.  He grew his forest, but the land is still plagued by demons, and his great-tree is twisted and gnarled.I'm still hopeful.  Maybe if we head into the Tainted Forest and clear out some of the taint...26185I believe that the taint of the Blasted Lands has finally exerted its influence over my friend Wormthorn.  His experiment has failed, and his great-tree now only serves as a focus for the demons to rally around.The tree must come down, and Wormthorn with it.  Speak with the Cenarion Observer on the other side of town; she should have some idea how to proceed.: the act we are about to commit must not be made known to the townspeople of Surwich.  Morale is low enough as-is.26186We need a way to get Wormthorn's attention.  Something to break him out of his trance.  Something that's guaranteed to work.The few types of wildlife that managed to make a foothold in the Tainted Forest are, without a doubt, affected by the land's latent energies.  Your task is to collect their body parts and find a way to combine them into a vessel.  If Wormthorn's trance is druidic, or even if it is demonic, a large enough vessel of tainted animal flesh should be able to break it.26187When word gets out about what we've done... there's no saying what the citizens of Surwich will do.  They cling so closely to Wormthorn's dream......but still, it must be done.  Take the demoniac vessel and use it on Marl Wormthorn to pull him from his trance.  Return to me when he is no more.26188My grandfather told me stories about his battles with a strider named Mazzranache. He told me of its demonic red eyes, razor-sharp talons and venomous bite.As fortune would have it, while traveling across the plains, I encountered it, and it took a nasty bite from my shoulder. He was as terrible as my grandfather described. I have gathered all the parts of the remedy I need to cure myself... except a flatland cougar femur.I grow weaker by the moment... please, help me.26189When we hauled up here to get away from the raptors, we put ourselves right next to a whole slew of Dragonmaw orcs!I've heard the stories in Menethil, how the Dragonmaw are even cruder barbarians than other orcs, how they strangle black dragons with their bare hands... I don't know how much of it's true, but I know we can't just let 'em sit up here in the hills.You've got the chops for it, . Head east to the Angerfang Encampment, take care of those orcs, and make sure you get their leader!26190If there is one meal I know the King likes, it's fresh catfish.  Catfish are easy to prepare but hard to catch.  That's where you come in!  We have a good population of Gigantic Catfish here in the waters of Stormwind but the competition to catch them is intense to say the least.  I need you to figure out a way to \"acquire\" some of these fine catfish for our King.  You will find fisherman at the small canal docks around town.  You should be able to figure out the rest of the plan on your own.2619126192The orphans of Stormwind are often forgotten, but not today my friend.  The king has requested a special batch of cookies be baked and sent immediately over to the orphanage.  I was almost finished with the final batch when I ran out of confectioners' sugar.  Can you run out and get some more for me?  You should be able to find it at any of the general stores or inns inside of Stormwind.26193The whispers of the elements are crowding my thoughts, ...The Throne of Tides is under siege!We cannot stand idly by while the naga threaten Neptulon's realm.Make ready! With this submarine and its armaments, perhaps we can make a difference.Speak to me when you are prepared for battle.26194The whispers of the elements are crowding my thoughts, ...The Throne of Tides is under siege!We cannot stand idly by while the naga threaten Neptulon's realm.Make ready! With this submarine and its armaments, perhaps we can make a difference.Speak to me when you have made your preparations.26195The greenwarden was a local legend. Many thought him a myth... the plant-man, protector of the wetlands. The night elves came here just to find him, and after they succeeded they ended up settling down to the east.They've got a whole grove over there to watch over the greenwarden, and I've heard he's been acting up, enraged by the flooding and damage to the land.The elves are good people. They could use the help of someone like you. If you get a chance, go tell the head druid what you've done here.26196The dwarves of Dun Modr fight day and night against the Dark Iron that have invaded their old home. While we cannot yet send our sentinels to risk their lives for them, we do send much needed supplies that they may sustain their vigil.If you would, bring this package to Longbraid the Grim, north of here. His men must certainly need its contents.26197It's a victory for us every time we're able to help another survivor escape from the contaminated halls of Gnomeregan. s like you will play an important part in the future of Gnomeregan.

Few people, even among the gnomes, truly understand the nature of the power we wield.As you become more powerful, you're going to start hearing the fel voices revealing their secrets to you, teaching you new spells.I want you to go get some more experience. Once you learn something new, show me.26202It's a victory for us every time we're able to help another survivor escape from the contaminated halls of Gnomeregan.

Once you can, come back here and try it out.26208The dwarves of Ironforge kindly took us in when the trogg invasion and radiation forced us to leave Gnomeregan for the first time. But even the kindness of friends can't quell the longing for home.I sent out a call for brave gnomes and other members of the Alliance to help us regain control of Gnomeregan and defeat the usurper Thermaplugg once and for all.We weren't able to achieve everything Operation: Gnomeregan set out to do, but Thermaplugg is on the run and we're closer to home than ever.26209Here's the deal, kid, we've got a full-blown murder on our hands. Double homicide... Single horse... icide.Worse yet, we're in Westfall. I could throw a rock behind me and hit a dozen hobos with motive enough to want to wipe these people (and horse) out.Now I don't know who did this and I sure don't appreciate having to come to this dump to investigate the deaths of a couple of squatters, but I'll be damned if I don't find the perp.

If it's a war they want, it's a war they'll get... and I don't plan to lose a war to creatures half my height.Get out there and kill me some dwarves.26240Our warriors are out there fightin' hard to kill them nasty Wildhammer dwarves, so we can be safe back here at the village. It's only right we do what we can to support them.A good beat's what every troll needs to do his best in a fight. The poundin' rhythm of the drums drivin' you to hit harder, callin' the spirits to watch over you. Take my drums to the battlefield wit' ya. Play 'em for our warriors, and let 'em show the Wildhammer who owns these lands!26241Hello, dear. Welcome to our home. Hmm, you don't look like you're homeless. Have you come to help us? If so, you're just in time! I'm planning dinner for the young ones and need a few simple ingredients.If you could get me some okra, goretusk flanks and stringy fleshripper meat I can make my famous Westfall stew! You'll find all of the ingredients near our farm. Just be careful of the harvest watchers. They are merciless killers.26243The pillar in this room holds up more than just the Temple of Earth.This entire plane of existence will soon collapse into our world if we fail to restore it.The time to act will come soon, .  But first you must listen to what I have to tell you.26244We're in the plane of earth, .  Everything is absorbed by the land eventually.The Storm's Fury will soon be turned to dust and we won't be able to gain any insight from its remains.Go and destroy the elementals that are dismantling the ship.  We're only delaying the inevitable, but we need to buy ourselves some time if we're to track down all the pieces of the World Pillar.26245The Archstone was being transported inside a flying Horde gunship called the Storm's Fury.The airship crashed south of here and our scrying has revealed the Archstone's no longer on it.Search the ship for clues related to what might've happened.26246...approaching the Temple of Earth at 300 knots and commencing landing maneuvers according to new route.  We've made note of a low pressure system in the north and redrawn our...BLOOD AND THUNDER!  ALLIANCE SCUM APPROACH!!26247The Earthen Ring is a neutral organization, .  We cannot pick sides in the war between the Horde and the Alliance.Look around you -- our members come from all backgrounds.  Our mission would be compromised should racial tensions be put above our goal.  Let's try to keep this under wraps until we have more information.We must not jump to conclusions just yet.  I'll send you and one of our new members to look for the Alliance gunship.Find out what you can without dragging us into the conflict.26248Something's wrong here, .The ship's crew has been slain.  Yet there is no bloodshed or damage to the ship's structure.This was not the Horde's doing.We will find the answers we seek by speaking to the spirits of the dead.  They have not yet left this world.Take this totem and place it near the corpses of the fallen.  You will have a few seconds to listen to their last few thoughts.Beware, however!  There is no telling how the spirits of the dead will react to our prodding.26249It's possible we'll find further clues inside the admiral's cabin. You will find it directly below us.See if there are any survivors or information that will lead us closer to the World Pillar fragment.  Be careful, .  Whoever got the crew might still be out there.26250It's not too late, .  The cultists are probably still here.Go below decks, find out who's in charge and subdue them.We will obtain answers to our questions, one way or another.26251It looks like the Twilight's Hammer's still on the ship.  Go below decks and take them out.Be careful, .  I've a feeling they're not here for a spiritual retreat, if you know what I mean.26252You have found what appears to be the heart of a harvest watcher.From the sound being emitted by the device you can tell that it's still fully functional. Perhaps you should return it to Farmer Saldean.26254Hop on, .  Let's see what Mr. Ogreface has to say for himself.Don't be shy, Stormbeak's only ever dropped a passenger a couple of times before.26255You must get word back to the others at the temple.  Chances are, the fragment is already getting moved to a more secure location.Tell Maruut what you know.  I'm going to do a little investigating about this Twilight Council in the meantime.26256The Twilight's Hammer are wielding foul magic here, .  They animate and energize the remains of Deathwing's blood, so that instead of drying out and disappearing it thrives and becomes more abundant.Take out one of the bloodshapers, see if they have any clues as to where we can find this \"forgemaster.\"26257From what I've heard, all you really need to do is find a suitable harvest golem and drop in the heart. Once you've done that you should be able to take full control of the creature.I think there's a whole field of overloaded harvest golems west of here, at the Molsen Farm. Look for the arcs of electricity.Should you manage to get it working, use the golem to destroy the energized harvest reapers at the old Molsen farm. Those monsters are much more destructive than the ones on our farm.26258The Twilight's Hammer involvement in the disappearance of the World Pillar fragment makes complete sense.  Let us hope that we can act swiftly enough to recover it.I've established a spiritual bond with you.  We should be able to communicate while you remain in Deepholm.Go to Deathwing's Fall to the southeast and investigate the Twilight's Hammer operation there.26259When Deathwing escaped to Deepholm, his corruption was extreme, but perhaps not yet absolute.The cultists at Deathwing's Fall harvest and shape the corrupted blood he left behind into living organisms to draw from their power.What if a trace of the Earthwarder's essence remains?  After all, Neltharion was the aspect of earth before he was the aspect of death.Gather samples from the living blood the cultists have created and we'll see if any trace of the Earthwarder remains.26260Go to the tower the slave spoke of.  You should find it on the northeastern end of the camp.If we can act fast enough we might be able to eavesdrop on the forgemaster's meeting.26261According to the orders you found, there is a key inside the tent in the southeastern end of Deathwing's Fall.Obtain it and free the slaves in the quarry to the south.26263We've been trying to take out the commander of the Wildhammer encroaching on our lands, but we've had no luck.Thornar Thunderclash sits in the safety of his command post, his voice booming across the battlefield to rally the dwarves. We're thinking he needs to be quieted.Cut Thornar down and we can clean up the rest of this skirmish with no problem.26264Most of us have seen the sickly and deranged gnomes suffering from exposure to the poisons and radiation of Gnomeregan. Eventually, they will devolve further, until they become mindless, but mostly harmless, puddles of toxic sludge.My research suggests that we may even be able to restore them from this state. Go to the Toxic Airfield to the south, subdue the toxic sludge I told you about, and bring back the possessions of the gnomes they once were.26265Tock Sprysprocket has some crazy theory about these toxic sludges being the last remnants of gnomes, so my men have orders not to engage them for now.However, the Toxic Airfield, just south of us, is teeming with living contamination. They are elementals composed of contaminated water and other toxic materials. Left unchecked, they'll overrun the town. Will you help us dispose of them?26266About four years ago, in the dead of the night, a little girl walked right into our farmhouse and collapsed on the floor. Nobody had a clue as to her identity. The poor little thing had no recollection of who she was or where she came from - truly a lost soul.Soon after, we adopted the little girl and named her Hope - for that is what she represented.She is now a young lady, caring for the destitute and homeless of Westfall. Take my Westfall stew to her at Sentinel Hill, south of here.26267Years ago, there used to be a Horde base deep within Skulk Rock. It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth reclaiming.The problem is, it's full of oozes by now. They're nasty things... mindless, corrosive, eat anything they find.I need someone brave to go to Skulk Rock and get rid of those slimes. Are you brave enough, ?26268I was at Skulk Rock during the second war. I was young, years before I met my mate, and I still remember the chaos when the Alliance attacked us. We fled with the orcs, without any time to gather our belongings.It was all left behind. Skulk Rock is still full of our old supplies. We could use them here at the village... and more importantly, the Wildhammer shouldn't get their filthy hands on them.26269One page!  I only need one more page!Master Nesingwary's novel ran into a bit of an... accident ... and we misplaced some of the pages.I've been asking your fellow adventurers to look for the missing pages, and they've been quite helpful, but one page still eludes me.I'm sure you're awfully busy with other matters, but while you're out in the jungle, would you mind looking for it?26270It's been many years since anyone has offered to lend us aid, . Had you not come along, we might not have made it through the coming winter. You have proven yourself to be a selfless individual - a person that we can trust. I only wish we had something of value to offer you.While I have no information to assist you in your crusade to bring the Furlbrow's murderer to justice, perhaps my wife can help. Speak to Salma inside and she will tell you what you need to know before you leave.26271Yes, I heard about the Furlbrow murders. It is very tragic, but such tragedy is a way of life in Westfall. There are many people here who simply no longer have the means or inclination to keep themselves fed. They have given up hope. Do you understand what it means to be left so hopeless as to stop caring about life? We must work together to show them that there is hope. That with the dawning day a better life comes.Take my mother's Westfall stew and help feed the homeless around Sentinel Hill.26272Tha Darkspear tribe have long been victims. Outcasts. We found ourselves fleein' our homes time 'n time again... but dis time, it's not fleein' dat drives us here.Vol'jin has offered us leadership through wisdom, and it has kept us alive dis long. Now dat same wisdom offers portents of a chaotic future for tha Horde unda Garrosh Hellscream.No, dis time we not fleein'.

Lend a hand here and there and I'm sure ya make yer way up to sometin' more prestigious quick enough.26278Throm'ka, !Your arrival at Grom'gol is timely, indeed.  Our mission to provide a safe chain of supply to Stonard is being hampered by some of the local inhabitants.I am putting you in charge of eliminating the raptor population outside of Grom'gol, just to the north.  Don't worry about the raptors themselves... those wretched Nesingwary hunters will take care of them.I want you to destroy their eggs.26279When we first arrived in this jungle we did not intend to wage war on the local tribes.  Our mission to supply Stonard is of the highest priority.  But complications have arisen.  A local band of ogres has occupied the Mizjah Ruins to the southeast of Grom'gol.  Despite warnings, they continue to ambush our supply caravans.I am putting you in charge of dealing with these uncooperative ogres.Travel to the ruins and attempt to drive them from the area.  At the very least it will send a firm message.26280The Murkgill murlocs have been pushed out of the ocean by the Saltscale murlocs, so they make their refuge in the Kal'ai ruins to our northeast.  This was acceptable in the past, but no longer.Separated from the sea, the Murkgill have grown restless, and they send their foragers to attack my supply caravans.  Send them a message: this behavior will NOT be tolerated by Hellscream's Horde.26281The trolls leave us well enough alone here in Grom'gol.  Most trolls know that the Horde can easily crush them when angered, and the trolls here in Stranglethorn are no exception.The Bloodscalp have been more active lately, however.  As lately as last week, they sent a party into Grom'gol and stole several cases of rations.Stealing food is the most forgivable type of theft, but I still can't let it happen under my watch.  Head north, to the Bal'lal ruins, and return our property.2628226283I've become very interested in the slimes inhabiting Skulk Rock. No matter how many times they're cleared out, they seem to return, yet it doesn't seem they're capable of reproducing from a single slime.I think something's growing in there. There's a source where all the slimes come from, and I want to study it. Find this source, and bring me back a sample.26284Fer a job like this, I normally bring me whole crew o' demolitionists. With some help in settin' up th' powder, th' charges, and th' rest o' th' gear, the job gets done a lot faster.Those blasted troggs have me men caged all around Frostmane Hold. Now I'm 'ere all alone without th' personnel I need to finish th' job.You look like a capable , though. Would you find th' demolitionists th' troggs captured and break them out o' their cages?26285It's gonna take a lot of powder ta collapse those caves. I don't know whether th' damnable troggs understood that when they stole me supplies and kidnapped me demolitionists! But th' outcome's th' same.Ain't gonna be able ta blow nothin' up until I've got that powder back.Go south to Frostmane Hold and kill any o' those troggs you find. Any one o' 'em could be carryin' me kegs o' powder.26286After my tour of duty was over in Grizzly Hills, I returned to Westfall, only to find the land in worse condition than when I left.The price of our war left thousands of citizens homeless. They now migrate here and squat upon the deserted farmhouses and towns of the region.To make matters worse, we are now under attack by the gnolls. The Westfall Brigade needs your help, . Slay the attacking gnolls and recover their orders. Someone is pulling their strings and we need to find out whom!26287We were once known as the People's Militia. These days, though, we fight under the banner of Stormwind, with the full support of King Varian Wrynn. Our goals here in Westfall are many: to clean up the mess left behind by the Defias, to expand the reach of the Alliance and to maintain order. So far we are failing on all fronts.Times are worse now than when the Defias ran amok. Now with the indigenous gnolls of the region up in arms, we find ourselves backed into a corner. Help us, !26288South of here is an area of Westfall known as the Dust Plains. From what we know the gnolls of the region have made the Dust Plains their unofficial capital. As with any capital, there exists a leader at the heart. If we are to put an end to these attacks, we must track down the gnoll in charge and end him.Venture forth into the Dust Plains, find the gnoll leader, Jango Spothide, and kill him. Take out any other gnolls that get in your way.26289SI: 7 has been tracking Helix Gearbreaker since he entered Alliance territory two weeks ago. The letter I received from Mathias Shaw explained that he sent an agent by the name of Kearnen to Westfall to shadow Helix. Find Agent Kearnen and you'll find Helix Gearbreaker.Kearnen came into town for supplies two days ago. She mentioned that she would be near Mortwake's Tower, southeast of here, on the Dust Plains.Get going, .26290Helix has got himself holed up inside Klaven Mortwake's old tower. I won't lie to you, , it's heavily guarded. I count six armed mercenaries just on the outside. There's no way you're getting inside that tower by yourself. Lucky for you, Claire and I are here.I'll cover your entry.Take this shrouding potion, you'll need it once you get inside. Use it as soon as you enter the tower and head upstairs. Find out what Helix is hiding up there!26291I'll be filling out my report and heading back to Stormwind shortly. SI: 7 must be informed of the happenings in Westfall. I would recommend you do the same and report back to Gryan.26292We have had a camp near Moonbrook for quite some time now, . One of my best soldiers works the area along with a company of Sentinel Hill troopers. Report to Captain Alpert now and find out if he has any news about the happenings in Moonbrook.Another ally of mine is also at the Moonbrook camp. His name is Thoralius. I met Thoralius in Northrend during my time in Valgarde. He is a wise and powerful shaman. Perhaps his abilities could help us solve this mystery.26293The \"Worldbreakers\" hide in a highland wilderness, squatting behind the Alliance kingdoms in the east. We will crush them, and we will do so with the mightiest army ever assembled since our victories in Northrend.I tasked our new goblin allies with the assembly of a host of war machines. Reports from the field reveal that their workmanship is sometimes... lacking.I will not go to battle with faulty machines. See Foreman Glibbs here in Orgrimmar and ensure my war machines are battle-ready!26294Hellscream isn't happy with our work? Oh - we even NAMED the \"Hellscream Demolisher\" after him. This is very bad. My boys need to step it up.Maybe you can help set an example. A set of Hellscream Demolishers just rolled off the blocks and are ready for inspection. Give them a thorough going-over, and if you find any problems, give the Chief Engineer a good thrashing. Remind them that the eyes of Hellscream are upon them!26295We've noticed a rise in violent acts amongst the homeless of the area. Something or someone is getting them all riled up. Now whoever is behind all this is getting more organized. Just recently a group of thugs came through here handing out pamphlets.Enter Moonbrook and look for evidence. Propaganda, leaflets, whatever... Bring whatever you find back to me. Maybe we can find the source through the writings.26296The material of this bandana is identical to the material found at the Furlbrow murder scene. You should collect more red bandanas as evidence and return what you find to Captain Alpert.26297It looks like the meeting the shadowy figure spoke of is starting soon. The homeless are starting to mobilize. I need you to attend the rally and gather information, .Go to the center of Moonbrook and listen in on the rally. Return to me with whatever you find out.26298A doom, there is.  A doom on my chief's youngest son, Yenniku.  As is a custom with our people, he was given to the Gurubashi Trolls of Zul'Gurub, but after my tribe, the Darkspear tribe, left with the orc Thrall, poor Yenniku was lost to us.  I was sent from distant Orgrimmar, back to Stranglethorn, to search for my chief's son.And I believe the Bloodscalp tribe has him.If you would help me, then hunt the Bloodscalps.  You may find them to the north.  Gather their tusks and return to me.26299We must find if Yenniku is dead.Slay the Bloodscalps of Zuuldaia and take from them their shrunken heads.  You must gather many, many heads, and I will inspect them to make sure Yenniku's head is not among them.And if Yenniku was killed by the Bloodscalps, then may a 600-year curse fall on the spirit of their chief, Gan'zulah!Go, .  You will find the heads at the ruins of Zuuldaia, along the coast to the north.26300Yenniku was not among the heads, and I thank the Great Serpent for it.  But we are no closer to finding him.We must know the truth, and I fear that only the Bloodscalp witchdoctor will know it.  He is an enemy of the Darkspear tribe and will not speak freely, so we must force the truth from his dead lips!Bring me the head of Nezzliok the Dire and place it within this cauldron.He is deep within Zul'Kunda.  Bring his head...we will then make it talk.26301It is true.  I know where the child of the Darkspears was taken.  You have bested me and bound my spirit, but I will say nothing without appeasement!The Bloodscalps war with the Skullsplitters.  To gain my favor, steal two of their most-prized trophy skulls from the Skullsplitters across the river to the east.  Place them here with us, so that my spirit will have slaves in the Nether.  One skull must be from their trophy pile in Balia'mah, the other from Ziata'jai.26302You have appeased myself and my chief, so I will tell you that which you seek to discover...Young Yenniku is lost to his clan.He was taken by the witchdoctor Zanzil the Outcast.  Now Zanzil controls him, body and soul, and only the most potent magic could set him free.A magic that you do not have, .Perhaps your Darkspear allies at Bambala in the east can offer a hope of Yenniku's salvation.  But that, I doubt.26303The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, in the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound just to the south.  His name is Mai'Zoth.  I know him from when the Darkspears dwelt in Stranglethorn - he is vicious, and his magic is strong.And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.You must face Mai'Zoth and wrest from him the Mind's Eye.  It is a perilous task, but it is the only hope we have of saving Yenniku.26304One year ago, my mother - that is, the troll who took care of me - was taken by the Skullsplitters of Zul'Mamwe.  Young and headstrong, I ran in after her, only to see her being pushed toward a burning brazier by a dozen of their warriors.  I hid behind a tree and watched as they grabbed her and... and...At nighttime, the lights from their braziers reflect off the treetops and keep me awake.  Please, ... travel south into Zul'Mamwe and put them out.26305I have reshaped the Mind's Eye into a Soul Gem.  Its purpose is twofold: you must use it to stun Yenniku, and once stunned place it upon his head to entrap his soul.My suspicions that I spoke of earlier were correct: the spirits tell me that Yenniku dwells not with Zanzil the Outcast, but within the Ruins of Zul'Mamwe, to the southwest.  Once you have freed Yenniku's spirit, return to Nimboya at Grom'gol.26306Today we make the first strike at the heart of the savage Vilebranch tribe. Show no mercy, ; this is no longer just a spat between trolls. Every victory of the Revantusk is a victory for the Horde!The Vilebranch headhunters and witch doctors will be the first to go. Make your strike against the lower terraces and report back to me with blood on your weapons.26307We won't give them a chance to react. You must re-enter Jintha'Alor and charge all the way to the upper tiers.The Vilebranch berserkers and shadowcasters are dangerous enemies, . When the others see their bodies thrown across the walls, they'll know we mean business.Don't leave any Vilebranch hearts beating!26308Only the strongest and foulest Vilebranch are left now. The soul eaters and blood drinkers, foul worshippers of the evil god Hakkar.They are FOOLS! They cling to old, defeated beliefs. I won't tolerate their crimes against the Revantusk any longer.Strike the final blow. Claim Jintha'Alor for the Revantusk... claim it for the Horde!26309The Vilebranch trolls here used to drink the corrupted blood of the god Hakkar himself for power. They boiled it in crude pots before drinking, dark vessels full of unholy strength.Hakkar was killed long ago, of course. But the interesting thing... I still see some cauldrons bubbling up there. Bring me back a few and we'll see just what they've got cooking.26310A moment if you're going up there, ...I've got a few brokers quite interested in potent toxins. I couldn't help but notice the spiders scurrying around near here... not giant ones, about the size of your hand.The skitterlings are a hue I've never seen before in this area. Could you collect a few for me and bring them back?26311The Warchief has designs to launch an all-out assault on the Twilight Highlands. Once there we hope to ally with the Dragonmaw orcs.Through my own sources I've discovered that a Dragonmaw orc resides here, in Orgrimmar. He is known as Herezegor Flametusk, and once he commanded legions of their warriors.His insider knowledge is precious to us. Find Flametusk and obtain for us a chart of the Twilight Highlands waterways.Last I hear, Flametusk was washed up at a bar in the Valley of Honor...26312When da attack started, we pushed out to take da field as quickly as we could. Dere forces were deep and endless... we underestimated dem.

Even a small break in battle be a chance to get much needed room ta breathe.Be swift, .26313Elementals are chaotic by nature, but dis kind of organized aggression is out of character. More so down here where dere deaths be a bit more permanent. I suspect dis is Therazane the Stonemother's doin', but I have to be sure.Destroy da Irestone Rumblers and bring me their cores. We'll be settlin' here and now if dis is da Stonemother's hatred brought down on us.26314We're fortunate dat those giants be havin' such bad aim. Luck is sure to be favorin' dem eventually though.We need to get dem off da battlefield, but I don't tink takin' dem head on would be very smart.Take dis grapplin' line, get a good hold on one of their ankles and pull their legs out from under dem. Once dey are on da ground, dey should be easy ta be finishin' off.26315Have ya seen the looming giant in the distance to the northeast? Dat is Boden the Imposing, one of Therazane the Stonemother's Stone Lords.We be knowin' little of da Stone Lords, but Boden is not known ta be very level-headed. Sadly, he seems to be da one leadin' dis assault, so he's the one we must be confrontin'.Take dis proclamation to him and read it aloud on behalf of da Earthen Ring. I know it be a bit of a stretch to think words will settle dis, but we have to try. Be cautious.26316The cataclysm tore open deep caves beneath Frostmane Hold and troggs flooded out of their warrens. They succeeded in displacing the trolls who used to live there and they stand to drive us out if we do not act.High Tinker Mekkatorque hired the renowned demolitionist, Jessup McCree, to close the caves and stem the trogg advance. We've received no word about whether he was able to stop the troggs. Would you look for him at his camp near Frostmane Hold, to the south beyond the Toxic Airfield?26317Upon dealing the final blow to the lashtail eggs, you look down to see a newborn hatchling looking back up at you.  You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.Your original assignment was to thin out the raptors, but you have fulfilled your egg quota, and this one is an innocent newborn.  Perhaps someone back at Grom'gol Base Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling.26318My team has finished settin' up th' powder kegs and th' detonator at the bottom o' th' cave in th' western part of Frostmane Hold. All you need to do is venture down there and activate th' detonator to explode the powder and collapse those tunnels.That'll stop th' flow of troggs from th' deep parts of th' earth. Mekkatorque'll have an easier time of dealin' with the remainin' troggs if you can take out their leader, who calls 'imself Boss Bruggor. Good luck, .26319There is a shaman here, Thoralius, who might be able to aid us. He is a friend of Gryan's who has recently come to Westfall to study the elemental devastation that has befallen us.Speak to Thoralius and see if there is something that he can do to shed some light on the identity of this shadowy figure.26320This incense will put your body and mind in a deep meditative state. Once the trance begins you will be pulled into the spirit world. Do not fight the trance once it has begun, . Allow the spirits to show you what they know.You must leave now.

Please, , use the western tree to reach Rut'theran, then speak to Vesprystus to secure a flight to Lor'danel. Be swift!26384We can't toss that tablet aside just yet, . We can use it...You see, I'm quite taken with the venom of the spiders here. It's clearly magical, probably related to that spider-god the trolls are involved with.

They're to the west, at the research station in the Hiri'watha ruins.26385It seems you have your first charge. You must travel back down to Rut'theran Village, where we first arrived, and speak to Vesprystus to secure a ride to Lor'danel.Once in Lor'danel, aid the night elves in any way that you are able. I am trusting you to treat them with the reverence that they deserve in light of all that they have done for us.I must travel to the distant city of Stormwind to meet with King Varian. I hope to see your face again very soon, . Until then, a fond farewell.26386Priestess is not very good at speaking Orcish, no.Maybe you go speak with Surkhan, upstairs.Tell him about what you've seen inside Zul'Gurub, yes.26387The spiders infesting the Creeping Ruin to the east are useless. We're calling them shadraspawn now, and it's clear they're related to the spider god, but that doesn't change the fact that they're more trouble than they're worth. I'd much rather just wipe the little pests out.When you head to the creeping ruin, destroy any cocoons you find. They feed off the bodies inside for days, so depriving them of their meal will be much more effective than trying to squash them all.26388Okay, you're all checked in.

I'll charge you a little, but trust me; it'll be worth it!26395, I gathered into this crate everything Argus asked for.  Can you take it to him?If you've already spoken to Bartlett at Goldshire, then you can take a gryphon back to him.  Dungar Longdrink is our gryphon master, over in the trade district.Speak with Dungar, then get this crate to Argus as fast as you can.  We don't want our fighting men and women in Goldshire to go without fresh equipment!26396The gryphon master in Goldshire is Bartlett.  If you've spoken to him before, then you can take one of my gryphons to him.That's a good lesson to know: gryphons are always trained to fly to their capital city, but they'll only take you to a remote gryphon master after you've already been there.You've already been to Bartlett, so just speak with me again when you're ready to take a gryphon to Goldshire.

They are the reason I have braved the dangers of the Zoram Strand.26466I fear the ancient statuette's secrets will remain forever hidden unless you find the key to their ancient locks.That key is a ring, the Ring of Zoram. It belonged to the rulers of this city before the waves of the Sundering drowned it.For years the ring was lost, but the naga have recently found it.Their leader, Ruuzel, dwells on her isle on the northern edge of the Zoram Strand. Please, , retrieve the ring for me!26467Listen, I don't know who you are, but I need your help. My sisters went to take back the Branch of Cenarius from the satyr. They said they'd be back soon, but it's been two whole days!, you have to find them! They were looking for the ruins of a night elf temple in Xavian to the northwest. I don't know what to think.

With the lake and the Horde pressing in on us, we had no choice but to retreat to the spire here.Go east. Take the lake back so that we will have a chance to retake the refuge some day.26472The druids are dead, killed by their leaders who were driven insane by the Horde tainting the Forest Heart! I can feel the corruption even from here and I dare go no further.While I am too well attuned to Ashenvale and the Forest Heart, you... you could descend into the barrow den and do what must be done. I've laid down breadcrumbs for you in there.Though it tears me apart, I must ask that you put to rest the druids' once great leaders: Taneel Darkwood, Uthil Mooncall, and Mavoris Cloudsbreak.26473There is a plant that grows in the old ruins of Bathran's Haunt across the road to the east. The plant is called Bathran's Hair and is known to cure ailments of the spirit.Now the Horde are there harvesting the plant for their own evil schemes.There is a sick child in Astranaar, and we believe that her illness is more than just physical. I promised my master that I would help seek a cure, but I am no fighter.Will you go to Bathran's Haunt and gather the plants?26474, now that it has been bathed in Elune's blessed light, I believe that the concoction will help the afflicted child. Please, take it to Astranaar and give it to the child's parent, Pelturas Whitemoon.To reach Astranaar, follow the road south and then east. However, if you'd like to get there more swiftly, speak with Sentinel Avana.26475I'd hoped Orendil's cure would save Relara, but I fear it only slowed the disease running through her. We must find more powerful medicine! Thankfully, Orendil spoke to me of further remedies should his first one fail.Elune's Tear is a type of stone that rests in only one place: the remains of Iris Lake, destroyed by the eruption of Thunder Peak, northeast of Astranaar. Orendil said the stone will wash away corruption.Please, , bring me Elune's Tear and pray it will end my child's sickness!26476Ah, there you are, . I've pored over the notes Teronis has made and it sounds like your next course of action is to find the other pieces of Dartol's rod.I would start by heading east along the road to Raynewood Tower.A dryad there named Shael'dryn is better suited to guide you. Seek her out.Keep the gem with you--Shael'dryn will need it if she's to help you recreate the rod.26477I wish your tidings were better.Raene is correct, I know about Dartol's creation and the treants in the area--at least I did once. They've become corrupted now, their nature twisted.To find the next piece of the rod, you'll have to find the key to open the chest it's in.The wooden key is on one of the treants northeast of here near the Felwood border, at the Howling Vale. Once you have it, look for a small glade through the tunnel at the vale. The chest should be hidden around there.26478The last piece of the rod is held by druids of the claw. I asked their leader, Oso Bramblescar, to give it to me, but he and his guardians nearly killed me! Clearly they too were affected by the Horde's corruption of the Forest Heart.But, I have an idea for how you can get into Oso's cave and grab the pommel.Ever since I was a faun, I've been pretty good at playing possum. It works great against bears! I can teach you! Go east to the Shady Nook, and if they try to get you, just use my technique.26479I suggest you find Raene and let her know the rod is finished. I'm sure she'll know what your next course should be.Be careful... I sense a great deal of power within it for both good and ill. I hope that you and Raene know what you are doing.Good luck, .26480I'm not completely certain what Teronis had in mind next, but if what he said was true about the rod's power, then it will allow you to take on another form altogether, presumably that of a furbolg.Perhaps he meant to use its powers to get closer to them, but even the uncorrupted creatures would slaughter him were he not careful. Transformed by the rod, Dartol would have to speak to a furbolg who was uncorrupted.I would start with one known as Krolg. Seek his hut southeast of Mystral Lake.26481I'm certain that the long-dead wizard, Dartol, intended to use his rod to subjugate and destroy us just as the night elves and orcs have, but I think now we'll put that thing to an unintended use.Ran Bloodtooth is the king of all of the Ashenvale furbolg. His tribe, the Bloodtooth, are the most powerful and keep themselves secluded in a camp just to the east.Kill them all and bring back his skull. Let us see if we can put it to good use.26482Now, take the rod and while using its power, speak with my brother, Ota Wen.Ota is amongst the other furbolg that the orcs have captured and have penned in the giant cage on the north side of Silverwind Refuge. The rod will allow you to convince Ota and the other furbolg to rise up and attack the Horde.Then you may go wherever your path leads you. Just know that you have found a new friend for that which you have done.26483As fun as it is to butt heads with these trolls, we've got other things to do down here. It'd be nice to get this battle over with, aye?Their commander, Gan'dranda, sits in the ruined walls to the southeast of the battlefield. Our boys have most of their forces locked up, so I want you to slip in there and take out Gan'dranda. When they see a  standin' over the corpse of their biggest hero it should take some of the fight out of 'em!26484The earthen and the stone troggs somehow found their way to Deepholm through Uldum more than fifteen thousand years ago. They've been warring ever since.If we're to recover the middle fragment of the World Pillar, the Stonefather must be rescued.Please go to Stonehearth and do everything that you can to aid the Earthen in their war against the stone troggs.You're our best hope, .26485I've got plans to brew up somethin' special for those pesky trolls. Aye, I said for them... a brew they won't ever forget! A brew that'll have them pickin' their tusks out of the hillsides!I've got a few ingredients steepin' already, but I could use a hand gatherin' more. At the bottom of the Overlook Cliffs to the east, near the shore, is a whole mess o' snapjaws. I need fresh, whole gizzards from them for my blastbrew.26486Now, I know we've got a little battle ragin' and all that, but down at the overlook cliffs are some nice lookin' bottles strewn all over the place. I don't want good drink to fall into the hands o' the Horde!If you're down that way, collect the bottles for me and bring 'em back here. I'll pay in full for it as if you bottled 'em yourself.26487It's not easy running a combination 5-star exotic resort/jungle resource salvaging plant!  That is, it wouldn't be easy, if I didn't have the organizational skills of a trade prince's personal assistant!The first trick is multitasking.  For example: the naga explorers to our south carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds.  We can sell these reeds to our clients overseas, and we can also stuff our visitors' mattresses with them!  Come to think of it, we could probably use some more of that stuff.26488Arnold and I used to relax down at the moat in the Valley of Heroes.  One day, I lost my locket in the lake and I have never been able to find it.  Rumor has it that huge royal monkfish live in that moat and that they eat anything!  I know it's a long shot, but do you think you could catch a few monkfish and look for my locket?Please let me know right away if you find it, it's very precious to me.26489Yes, can I help...!  Is it really you?!  Look how big and strong you've gotten!  Let me feel that bicep!Me?  I've been trying to make my gold here in the jungle.  We're mainly in resource acquisition, but we also do tourism.I know, genius, right?Hey, listen.  I was thinking... the naga explorers to the south carry Akiris reeds, which we could sell, and use to stuff visitor mattresses.  You interested in killing some naga?  It'll be just like old times!26490Not many dwarves know this, but to get a REAL kick out of my brew I add a wee bit of the oozes around here. Aye, the giant green dwarf-eatin' oozes, those ones.This brew's gonna have a HUGE kick to it though, so we need a huge slime! There's one lurkin' down in Skulk Rock that's the mother o' them all, absolutely huge...the Direglob, we call it.If you've got what it takes, head down there and take a chunk out of the Direglob for me!26491Years ago, there used to be a Horde base deep within Skulk Rock. It's been abandoned since then, but it's still prime territory, worth takin' for our allies!Problem is, it's full of dwarf-eating slimes and oozes. Those things are slightly less disgustin' than trolls, but they'll still give us a hassle.With our boys tied up fightin' the Revantusk, I need you to go to Skulk Rock and clear the place out for me.26492I had a cousin in the second war! He used to tell me all about when they led a raid on Skulk Rock. Swept in there and drove the trolls out like rats from a nest. They chased right after 'em all the way to Alterac!The slimes moved in right quick after that, and there's still cratefuls of old Horde goods sittin' in there. I say we don't let the trolls get it back!Bring me back a few crates from Skulk Rock to the northwest.26493So, while you're already all sweaty from doing all that other stuff, I was thinking I might grab you for one more task.  You don't mind, do you?The latest Science and Explosions journal just came in from Bilgewater Harbor, and there's this article about this hot new reagent.  Prices on the reagent are skyrocketing, and we're in prime position to capitalize!You got that?  Good.  You can find the basilisks in a cave, far to the east.26494Mind giving some of this stuff to Jasper, over by the luxury suites?  I'm sure he can find some use for it.Thanks, !26495Chabal, that troll over by the botanical gardens/biological weapons lab, is a special guest.  He's a representative of the Zandalari trolls, and has traveled quite far to stay with us.Here, give this to him.  Tell him that the Zandalari are always welcome at Hardwrench Hideaway!  And mention that referrals are key to maintaining our business!26496The Revantusk isn't the only tribe of foul trolls we're here to take care of! The Vilebranch have corrupted this land for years from their stronghold of Jintha'Alor.We're done sittin' by in Aerie Peak twiddlin' our thumbs, if you haven't noticed. Doran Steelwing leads the charge against the Vilebranch from a camp the boys took just to the south. Speak with him and join the fight!26497The Vilebranch are a different tribe from the Revantusk, but the difference is academic. Far as we're concerned the only good troll is a dead troll!But make no mistake, the Vilebranch are just as nasty even without the Horde's chain around their neck. They'll poison this whole land unless we take this stand and get rid of themYou can start with their witchdoctors and headhunters on the lower tier. Let me know when you've killed a fair share of 'em.26498We're makin' good progress. Keep pressing on, and don't falter!The Vilebranch berserkers fight like savage animals, whipped into a blood frenzy. Their shadowcasters summon foul spirits from beyond this world! This is why we're getting rid of these depraved creatures, , never forget that.Head to the middle tier and kill the berserkers and shadowcasters!26499With the Stonefather taken prisoner, our forces are demoralized. Normally any one of mine could take five times his number of stone troggs. But now....I want you to head out into the field surrounding the town. Plant Stonefather Oremantle's banner near my defenders. Grant them his boon and remind them of that for which they fight.26500Our war has been waged for longer than your kind counts time. Let us see if you can make a difference, .The stone troggs are a mistake of the titans. On your world they have succumbed to the Curse of Flesh. But here, in Deepholm, you see them in their true form.We're surrounded. Maybe you could go out there and break a few troggs down for us. See what they're really made of?26501The stone troggs have found a way to burrow up from underneath our homes!I've sent our geomancers to seal all of the buildings, but they need these reagents and enough time out of battle to properly cast their rockslide rituals.When you're done, report to, Gravel Longslab, just to the north on the Fractured Front.26502To the north lies the Fractured Front. That is where most of the heavy fighting is happening.Go into Stonehearth proper and grab all of the thunder stones that you can. Our engineers need them for the catapults.When you have enough, take them to Clay Mudaxle. Don't mind his tongue. He's old and cranky, and should have gone back into the earth thousands of years ago.26503Damned worthless gnolls are up to no good. I can feel it in my bones. Gnoll activity in the area has tripled in the past two weeks. I fear they might be mounting up to make an assault on Lakeshire.I need you to head to each of the gnoll camps of this area and gather any information that you come across. Check the camps directly north of here, east of here and southeast of here. Bring back whatever you find.26504By order of the Stormwind Royal Guard, all gnolls of the region known as Three Corners in the southwestern corner of Redridge Mountains, are wanted dead.Should you dispatch of the gnolls of the region, report your victory to Watch Captain Parker at Tower Watch.26505Here it is, . Take my report to Lakeshire, located north of this tower, and deliver it to Magistrate Solomon. Inform him that we need a more comprehensive solution for dealing with the gnolls. Suggest explosives. Lots of explosives.And stick to the road if you know what's good for you.What's good for you is staying alive, by the way. In case you didn't know what was good for you. You now know... Oh never mind!26506I need your help, ! Our rations have run out and the guards are getting hungry. They're clamoring for my world famous franks and beans, but I have no ingredients on hand. Would you be a darling and help me out?I need some goretusk kidneys, condor giblets, and tarantula eyes. You'll find goretusks, condors and tarantulas near this tower. Just look around!26507Petrified bats.Elementals of that size are picky. You're not likely to find anything better easily.To the east are basilisks. They petrify stone bats that fly too close and snack on them when they grow hungry. You may find bats scattered around their territory.I must warn you... if you show that little elemental too much attention, you're unlikely to be rid of it. It can be very... needy.26508My friend Nida lost her necklace, and we can't find it.  We've been fishing all day right here, and we looked around here already.  The only thing I can think of is that it fell into the lake.  Our parents don't want us to swim in the lake... my mom says there's some mean things underwater, but you look like you aren't scared of mean things.Could you find it for her, please?26509Once again my garden was trampled and pillaged.  And I know the brute who is doing it.  It's that forsaken boar, the one Marshal Marris has taken to calling Bellygrub.I won't be able to re-plant the daffodils until next season now.  Ruined!  All ruined by that one menacing boar.  Put an end to that pest!  Show me his tusk and I'd be happy to reward you.  He seems to spend his time foraging in the field southwest of Lakeshire but occasionally he roams over here and into my garden.26510More of our citizens go missing every day. We think the gnolls are responsible, but we have no idea where they are taking them! If you are to help us defeat the gnolls and find our people, you must be properly equipped. Unfortunately, we are all out of gnomecorders. Without a gnomecorder, there is no way for us to communicate with you when you are in the field.Our last good gnomecorder was stolen by marauding murlocs last week. You will have to go to Lake Everstill, east of here, and recover it!26511Headed out to Lake Everstill? You'll be happy to know that we currently have a bounty on murlocs. Kill as many as you can and be rewarded! Any murloc will do. All you need to do is kill indiscriminately.You'll find Lake Everstill directly east of Lakeshire. It's the lake. Has water in it... Any of this ring a bell?26512The gnomecorder looks to be in working order. I've got you all hooked up, now we just need to tune the gnomecorder for reception.Head north out of Lakeshire and follow the road up to the graveyard. Once you reach the graveyard I'll attempt to transmit.26513We were raided last night, or perhaps it was the night before. I'm not really sure when it was as I haven't had a wink of sleep in three days. I'm probably delusional at this point.Listen, gnolls raided our supply stores and took off with everything! Just like a fart in the wind, they were in and they were OUT! My soldiers saw them running back towards the canyons, northwest of here. Recover our supplies, !26514The first order of business is a romp through the Redridge Canyons, directly north of Lakeshire. Kill every gnome that you see... woops, did I say gnome? I meant gnoll. Kill every GNOLL that you see and take their collars as proof of deed.I must warn you, ; while you are out there, watch out for ettins. My scouts have reported seeing huge, bloodthirsty ettins roaming the canyons lately. Stay out of their way if you want to remain alive.Solomon out. I'll be in touch.26515I've got a plan to pit troll against troll.The Vilebranch have a big ol' dire troll locked up in a pit with some flimsy-lookin' chains. I've seen those things fight, and there's no way those'll hold if that big brute gets swingin' mad!I want you to find the dire troll and fight him, . Don't kill him... just smack him around til' he's seein' red, then let him break free and get out of his way! He'll be a big pain for the Vilebranch.26516Only the strongest and foulest Vilebranch are left now. The soul eaters and blood drinkers, foul worshippers of the evil god Hakkar.Don't forget you're not just fighting trolls here, . You're fighting dark and evil forces that'll churn this land into ash if we let them live!Show no mercy!26517You have to go to the summit now, . Our warriors won't go past the final gates. They say it's still as a tomb; not a sound, not a breath, not a hint of motion.They think it's a trap, but based on what you've brought me, I'm worried it's something even more sinister. Go to the altar, investigate what happened... and bring me back ANY sort of mystical object or dark idol you find! Do you hear me?26518Umboda Three-Heads is one o' the biggest trolls you'll see around. He's a savage butcher, takin' heads for his own collection, dwarf and troll alike! It's time he got what he deserved.Look for the big brute on the lower terraces, and you take his own head right back here!26519You've stumbled upon a gnoll document. The gnoll that wrote this propaganda is semi-literate:BROTHERS OF YOWLER, HEAR DIRTPAW! DIRTPAW GIVEN ORB FROM ORCS! DIRTPAW CONTROL ETTIN THINGS! DIRTPAW CRUSH HUMIES! COME GET DIRTPAW PAW-O-GRAPH IN RETHBAN CAVE. CAVE IS WEST, HIDDEN IN CANYON!You should probably investigate.26520You now control the orb, therefore you now control the ettins. Maybe you can use an ettin to remove the huge boulder currently crushing Foreman Oslow over at Lakeshire. Find an ettin and use the orb on the ettin. Then head over to Lakeshire.26521The Vilebranch have hung their tiki masks all across the walls of Jintha'Alor. We won't tolerate their foul hexes and dark magic.It's time to send a message, and tear down their defenses, all at once! Take this torch, . Set fire to their tiki masks and watch 'em burn. They'll know the Wildhammer want them gone when they see their dark idols consumed!26523There's somethin' I've noticed up there... Jintha'Alor's full of spiders. Small ones about as big as yer hand. Not an unusual sight for the Hinterlands, but somethin's amiss.To be honest, I don't trust the trolls to keep pets. They're up to somethin'. I need you to bring me some of those spiders. Keep 'em alive if you can, and we'll see what the spirits tell me...26524The Vilebranch trolls here were always worshippers of the foul god Hakkar, the loa of blood. He was a sick and twisted entity that nearly broke through to our world, but he was defeated long ago.The Vilebranch are still stirring their dark cauldrons, ones they filled with blood years before. They're either holding onto hope for a long-dead spirit, or they're up to something new and just as sinister.Get me those vessels, . We need to examine them with the spiders and see just what's going on here!26525If the sacrifice has already been made, Shadra's presence is going to start creepin' into this realm. That cave's probably full of her spawn by now.Don't let them escape, . Slay any of those vile spiders you find!26526Shadra the spider loa... the venom queen, a spirit of darkness and death! If there's been a sacrifice, they're trying to bring her forth as a last-ditch effort.If the Vilebranch are performing rituals, I'm not going to let them finish.Check the cave behind the altar at the top of Jintha'Alor. Deep within it, one of Shadra's keepers might still be lurking. Kill her and take whatever she carries back here so we can know what's going on.26527I'd smash this tablet to bits if I had the right, but that's not for me to decide. Gryphonmaster Talonaxe needs to see this.You've got to return to Aerie Peak with the tablet. Gryphon Master Talonaxe is in the aviary, tending to the gryphons.Be swift... and don't let that tablet leave your grasp for a moment!26528Gryphon Master Talonaxe has sent me here to deal with Shadra, the Venom Queen. The conquest of Jintha'Alor isn't enough... the trolls could regroup and summon this creature later, when we're not expecting it.We'll gather the artifacts first, pull Shadra into this world on our own terms, and put our hammers to that foul creature. I'll need you to help find the artifacts, and put a hurt on the rest of the trolls while you're at it.We first need the Eye of Shadra, guarded in Agol'watha to the north.26529We'll need the Fang of Shadra next.It's kept in the Creeping Ruins to the east, guarded by Shadra's own spawn. Hideous spiders the size of a dwarf, and twice as strong. Their venom is strong, ... don't get careless.26530The final piece is all we need to burn Shadra out for good.The Shell of Shadra is held by the spider god's last living high priestess, Qiaga the Keeper. She stands atop the Altar of Zul, guarded by other fanatical zealots.You've got to climb that altar to the top and take her out! She'll have the Shell in her possession. Bring it back here.26531Our best fighters are ready, we've got the idol assembled... it's time, .Here's what we're gonna do. You'll travel southwest to Shadra'Alor ahead of us with the idol. You'll need to use the idol at each of the three temples, fighting through the trolls guardin' them.When you do that, Shadra will emerge into our world, and we'll be right there waiting for her with fury in our hearts.

She's comin' out of the water right now!Gryphon Master Talonaxe is comin' right now with the boys, let's show that bug what for!26533Years ago, the Gurubashi exiled one of their own from Zul'Gurub: a troll by the name of Zanzil.  The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw.  Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but Zanzil the Outcast remains......as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.I'd like to get my hands on some, .  Check the zombies to the southeast.26534Visitors to Hardwrench Hideaway sign a number of waivers upon arrival, one of which allows us to perform basic tests on them.  I'd say it's about time we invoked that clause again.Actually, let's avoid poisoning our customers this time.  Better for business.The Hideaway's southeastern tower serves as a temporary jail.  \"Hardwrench Hoosegow,\" we call it.  Anyways, give the prisoners a drink and tell me what happens.26535I need Zanzil's recipe, now more than ever.  One of Zanzil's flunkies at the Ruins of Aboraz must have it on him.

That's the kind of time it takes to find a good fishing spot.  One of my favorites is called Thunder Falls.It's just south of Stormwind in Elwynn Forest.  Best part about Thunder Falls is the violet perch.  I have never seen them anywhere else, only up there at the falls.  It's a bit of hike for me and Arnold to get out there these days though, do you think you could head up there and fetch some of those perch for us?26537I want you to go out there and I want you to finish them.Berserkers, Earthrenders, Deathriders...

Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the emissary he sent to the Skullsplitters.  This is not good news.I want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans.  Take this incense, and place it in front of the bat totem in the Ruins of Jubuwal, to the east.  Hir'eek will guide you from there.26551You are to kill Zanzil.  You rode on Hir'eek's wings and saw through Hir'eek's eyes; you know where Zanzil hides within the Ruins of Aboraz.

Zul'Gurub is a dangerous place, but Chabal entrusted this task to you.The portal lies in wait in front of you.26553Ahead of you looms a ramp up to one of the city's many terraces.  The bat-shaped totems ahead of you indicate that this is the domain of High Priestess Jeklik, a follower of Hir'eek.Jeklik was one of the Hakkar-worshipping priests that Zanzil was planning to resurrect.

A few specimens would really help me figure out what exactly is going on.Can you help me out?26557I've fished sandy carp in Orgrimmar's local waters for years now.  Recently, I have noticed my bait is not working as well as it used to.  I suspect it has something to do with all the tauren that moved into the Valley of Wisdom.I spoke with one of their local fisherman and it just turns out their appetite has changed.  They are biting on stag eyes these days.  You should be able to find plenty of stags north of Orgrimmar, just outside the northern gate.26558The idol is prepared, . I trust that you are as well?You will go southwest to Shadra'Alor ahead of us with the idol. You'll need to use the idol at each of the three temples.When you do that, Shadra will be summoned to this realm. The Deathstalkers and I will be along shortly to subdue and harvest her body. Speak with the lookout I've sent ahead once you've performed the ritual, and await my arrival.26560I don't know where Krakauer or Danforth are, but Jorgensen was being held at Render's Camp, northwest of here. I was in the same crap filled cage with him before they relocated me to Alther's Mill.If we're gonna get him out we'll need the key. A stone cold witch from hell known as Utroka the Keymistress holds on tight to that thing. We'll have to kill her if we're going to get Jorgensen's cage key. She's up north in the valley leading to the Burning Steppes.Let's go, kid.26561Krakauer is up on the chopping block as we speak! The orcs brought in a Gurubashi witch doctor to perform a dark ritual on him. We need to kill that troll to free Krakauer!Let's go! He's just inside the cave here. Hang a right at the first fork.26562Danforth's being tortured on the other side of the cave. There's no telling what state he's in by now! We need to get over there and save him!Overlord Barbarius has the key to the lever holding Danforth up. We work together as a team and we can kill that bastard, Barbarius. Once Barbarius is dead, we use his key to get Danforth down and get out of here!Ready?26563I don't know who you are, , but you've earned the respect and admiration of the Bravo Company. You've managed to save all our hides and kill a boatload of orcs in the process. Now we return the favor.Get back to Lakeshire and report to Colonel Troteman. We'll find Johnny and deliver the good news in person. With the Bravo Company back in action, these orcs don't stand a chance.26564They've smashed all of our catapults. I've been trying to get this one working, but no luck so far.Maybe you'd like to make yourself useful. Head out onto the front and grab me any spare parts you come across.You think you can handle that, flesh bag?26566We will need all the weapons, inventions, and soldiers we can get in order to defeat Razlo Crushcog and his followers.Over to the northeast, you'll find Engineer Grindspark, one of a new generation of brilliant gnomish minds. Why, he hasn't had an explosion in over three prototypes!But enough bragging. Engineer Grindspark is working on a bot that he says will help clean up the toxic airfield. You should introduce yourself to him and see if he needs any help testing it.26567You ever heard of John Keeshan, ? I was his commanding officer throughout all three great wars. Let me tell you, that man has killed more orcs than any man alive. If anyone can stop the Blackrock orc invasion, it's JOHN J. KEESHAN. We need to get him to help us or Lakeshire will be nothing more than a mound of rubble and ash after that massive Blackrock army marches through to Elwynn.I heard he was fighting in the underground fight club at the Lakeshire inn. Find him and tell him everything you know.26568They asked me to fight in those wars. I didn't ask them! I did what I had to do to win. So I end up getting captured by those filthy, crap-swilling, maggot orcs and for five long years they used me as a toilet. Finally I break out and head back to my hometown and what do I get? People spitting on me, protesting me, calling me a baby orc killer and all kinds of vile crap!No, I don't think I'll be helping you. You go back to Troteman and you tell him that this ain't my war.26569Ah, my savior! I've heard that you're on a mission to save Lakeshire... and my bridge. Yep, worked too damned long on that thing to let it get destroyed by an army of marauding orc monsters!Listen, if you're headed up north towards Render's Camp, would you do me a solid and get me some spyglasses from the Blackrock trackers up there? I could sure use 'em for my new surveying gear.26570Heading up north, eh? How about you wage your own little war against those Blackrock monsters? What do you say, ?Kill any Blackrock orc that you see at Alther's Mill or Render's Camp. Kill until your skin turns red from their blood splatter and then come back to me and I'll pay you handsomely.It might not stop the Blackrock invasion, but it'll be sure to put a kink in their plans.26571What I'm about to ask of you isn't going to be easy to accomplish, . Keeshan left everything back there in that orc prison, and I'm not just talking about his soul or his will to live.If we're going to get Johnny ready for war, we need to recover his prized possessions. The orcs now hold Keeshan's bow and his survival knife.Head to Alther's Mill, east of here and look for two orc lieutenants, Murdunk and Homurk. They've got Keeshan's gear. Get it back.I'll be in touch via gnomecorder.26572You heard of the golden stonefish, ?  The thing with these fish is that they can't be caught by normal means.  They have jaws so strong that they snap right through any hooks or lures you try to use on 'em.You can find a number of them in Thunder Ridge, south of Orgrimmar.  That ridge used to be full of thunder lizards, but they all drowned in the flood.Take my knife, swim down there and cut off their tails.  You should be able to use the tail to zap any stonefish you find.26573His gear alone won't be enough, . His heart must also be in this battle. To capture that, we need items of sentimental value. The Blackrock orcs of Render's Camp, located in the north, hold two such items that belong to Keeshan.Get up there and search their coffers for Keeshan's headband and a jade amulet left to him by his wife - who was brutally killed during a Blackrock orc invasion.Bring them back to me should you succeed.26574Lady Shandris has already asked for you to assist us further.Adella has struck out to the east, among the woodpaw gnolls, and established a foothold south of Camp Mojache. You are to report to her if you wish to assist Lady Shandris and the Alliance further.Don't stray too close to Camp Mojache... the Horde will not hesitate to attack. Keep to the south and look for our banners.26575I've one more favor to ask, fleshling.There is a basilisk, much larger and much older than the rest. Though we normally fear nothing from their kind, this one has become so potent as to petrify some of my sons. This shall not be abided.Find Gorgonite to the east and slay him. He has lived much longer than necessary.26576Nearby to the north, you will find Terrath the Steady. He has taken upon the task of pulling the stone dragons back into the fold. We find ourselves repeating this trial every few hundred years... the stone dragons are fickle, and bend only to strength.Terrath is balanced and reasonable, but his goals may not be easily accomplished. Go to him. Appeal to the more balanced side of the Stonemother.26577To the east, on the Crimson Expanse, you will find Gorsik. He embodies the more unstable and violent nature of our kind. He is neither friendly, nor trusting, but his word carries weight.Proving yourself to Gorsik will go a long way towards proving yourself to the Stonemother.26578The rift to your world has poisoned our home. Corrupted it. Polluted it.This expanse festers and grows. It becomes difficult to even see the purity of the rock beneath this filth.If you are here to lend your aid, then go about cleansing this overgrowth. Look for the brightly glowing mushrooms that are growing faster than the others. They are the worst of the offenders.26579The fungal behemoths that surround us have succumbed to a weakness very similar to that that affects your kind. Their skin has grown soft. They no longer belong with the stone.Kill them. We do not wish to see this infection spread.26580Fleshling. Some of your kind skitter among the rocks. Too cowardly to approach, too swift to be crushed.If you wish my favor, deal with them. I tire of these games.26581I'm no druid, but some of these mushrooms do not look to be naturally occurring. I know that our Stone Lord friend over there is eager to blame this on exposure to Azeroth, but I suspect more domestic causes.I saw some clouds of red mist to the northeast, near the water's edge. They seemed to be spurring new growth in their wake. Take one of my wind-devils with you and get me a sample from those clouds. You may have to stay close to the ground to spot them.26582This is most definitely magic in origin. Not even druidic. I suspect one among the stone troggs to the north.Go to Gorsik and point him in their direction. Hopefully this will help earn his favor.26583Their leader hides within his hole ahead. He is the one that has brought the plague upon the crimson expanse.He must be killed.One of your Earthen Ring companions is already inside. You should speak with her.26584I have sent my brothers to assault the Verlok village from below. The Verlok will gather on their rocky ledges, as they always do to avoid our ire. When they do, we shall make the earth itself shake them until they fall at our feet below.That is where you prove your use. When they fall to the ground amongst my brothers, make sure that they do not rise again.26585If this disgusting growth is truly brought on by the Verlok, then their supplies will be in their village to the north. Bring them to me so that I can verify your claims.26586If you and Keeshan are going to defend Lakeshire, we're going to need to find his old battalion. Last I heard all of 'em - Messner, Jorgensen, Krakauer and Danforth - were captured by the Blackrock orcs. Now I don't know where they could possibly be or if they're even alive, but I'd be a damned fool if I didn't ask you to try and find 'em.Search Alther's Mill, east of here, for any clues.26587The key to this cage is stored in a pouch over at the worg den, just north of our location. The problem is that the pouch is resting safely atop a tree stump amidst a sea of bloodthirsty man-killing worgs.You've got one shot to get that key without waking up any of those sleeping worgs. Head to the worg den and find a way into the center. Tread carefully and watch out for the Blackrock worg captain. Get the key and return to me.If you got a pet, I'd recommend telling it to stay back!26588Are you up for a challenge, ?  Good, I was hoping you would be.  The Southfury River flows just west of Orgrimmar and your challenge can be found within its mighty flow.We are looking for a giant furious pike.  This esteemed fish used to be prevalent in these areas but ever since the floods hit, the big ones have been much harder to find.  Head out to the river and let's see just how good of an angler you really are.26589You are truly brave to help us protect these lands, hero. If you wish to do more for the wilds, there are others in need of your aid.The verdant forests of Feralas lie to the south. There, in the shade of the mighty Twin Colossals, you must seek out Konu Runetotem. He has found signs of a disturbing illness.Follow the road west around the Twin Colossals to find Camp Ataya. Go in peace, , and walk with the Earth Mother.26590Hey, listen.  You don't look like any old tourist, and I'm in a bit of a pickle.  My cousin up north sent me this weird artifact, and I need your help to... ah... identify it.To start out, I'm going to need you to obtain The Holy Water of Clarity.  Rumor has it that whoever drinks from this spring is given a vision of clarity.Sounds pretty promising, doesn't it?Obtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp.  Good luck!26591You seem quick on your feet, . I need someone to go out into the chaos of the front and patch up our injured.Take my kit. It's simple enough to use.Heal them before the stone troggs finish them off for good.26592To properly identify this artifact, I will need tools for analysis.  A diffractory chromascope should suffice, I think.I already have the mithril casing, which surprisingly, is the hardest part to find.  We simply need two other pieces: a ruby and a sapphire.There's pirates nearby, just to our south, and a bit farther to the east.  Pirates love treasure... why don't you see if you can find some gems for me?26593If there's one thing I can't stand, it's people who don't pay their gambling debts!  And there are a lot of people who owe me.  Think you can help me collect?First, there's \"Shaky\" Phillipe down by the docks.  He owes me plenty after last week's game and I want my due!  But to get it, we'll have to scare him.Go out of town and hunt elder mistvale gorillas.  Find a nice selection of giblets, then take them to Shaky.  Don't let on that they're from an animal; let him think the worst.26594Here, take this pouch and give it to Sea Wolf.  And tell him I meant to pay him back!  I swear!!I just got a little drunk and lost my way, and...you know how things are.  He'll understand - you don't have to get rough!26595There's three phases to debt collecting: asking nicely, asking forcefully, and something I like to call \"Phase Three\".Unfortunately, collecting during Phase Three is something that this old dog can't do any more.  That's why I employ so many cronies, stooges, mooks, goons, and noble adventurers like yourself!Juntz Fitztittle, Ephram Moonfall, and Maury Wilkins are hiding out on the eastern coast.  You should have no problem visiting them all in one trip... and bringing back their valuables.26596I've been sent by the good people of Theramore to find loyal members of the Alliance who are willing to help Lady Jaina with some problems in Dustwallow.You weren't really here working for the goblins, were you?The path back to Dustwallow will take you through Ratchet.  Wait on the end of this pier for the next boat.  Once you get to Ratchet, speak with Gazlowe.  He'll point you in the right direction from there.Ugh, I think I stepped on a fish!  And it flopped!26597Sick...so...very s-s-sick... have contracted Stranglethorn Fever.......technically...

I was a successful captain with a sterling reputation.Until...Those cursed sea giants ruined me!  They smashed my ship, killed my crew, and set me on a lifeboat to Booty Bay.  I will not rest until their corpses pepper the ocean floor!One of the giants, Gorlash, stole my captain's chest.  I hear Gorlash wanders the coast east of here.  Find him and get back my chest!  Do that, and you'll have earned a captain's gratitude.26600The next giant on my list is called Negolash.  I remember vividly how he leapt from the seafoam and plucked poor Poop-Deck Paul from the crow's nest.Swallowed him in one gulp, he did.  And snapped my mizzenmast in two on the way down.No man on my crew deserves such a heinous death.  So we're going to use Negolash's appetite against him.  Kelsey Yance should be able to sell you some meat, and Whiskey Slim has enough booze to knock out... well, a sea giant.  You'll find both of them in town.26601Mok'rash the Cleaver is the last of the lot.  And the largest, by my memory.  Taller than a wave in a windstorm, with a beard like a kelp forest and a hammer like an oak tree.He taunts me from Janeiro's Point, the island right off the end of this very pier.  It's because of him that I'm still trapped here, living this lamentable landlubber's life.If you can swim, then head out to Janeiro's Point and slay Mok'rash.Take care, .  Mok'rash will not lay down as easily as his brothers.26602Take this food, and put it in our old lifeboat, southeast of here along the coast.  When Negolash smells all that food, he'll come running!And when he does, there will be a stouthearted  ready to knock his corpse back into the briny deep.26603Inside the bottle you find a note which reads, in fairly good handwriting:26604These vicious jungle cats have been circling me for some time now.  I watch them as closely as I can, but they seem to just... disappear into the grass.How they snarl and hiss!Don't get me wrong... I still want you to rescue me, but first, clear out some of these cats.  I won't need to be rescued if I end up someone's dinner.26605I understand that you're anxious to rescue me, but the time is not yet right.  First I'm going to need some of my things.The gorillas and the monkeys on the other side of the island have taken most of my possessions.  I'll need my tiara, my scepter, my slippers, and my diary before I'm ready to leave.What?  Stop looking at me like I'm some sort of insane person.  You don't know what it's like being a princess.26606, I now put my faith in you to help free me.  The great Skymane King Mukla is my captor.  He commands the beasts of this island, and they keep me here against my will with the aid of this chain.  If you can slay him and find the key to this shackle, I shall be indebted to you greatly.I often hear him to the southeast side of the island, but please be careful: he is not to be trifled with.26607Take this bundle of Keeshan's possessions and head back to the Lakeshire inn basement. Bravo Company is already there, talking to Keeshan. Remind him of who drew first blood, . Lakeshire needs Keeshan. The Alliance needs Keeshan.Dismissed, soldier!26608Go now, go back to your fleet. Tell them what kind of a monster claims authority over the Dragonmaw.Our \"Warchief\" is a traitor to his blood. Since his return from Outland he reeks of demon and leads what remains of our clan to ruin.Help rid the Dragonmaw of Mor'ghor, and those of us with pure blood will be your allies forever. This I can promise.26609You sure seem eager to work, matey.  Not sure why some land-loving   is offering help to the Blackwater Raiders, but I'm not going to turn you away.We've made Booty Bay our happy home away from the high seas, but word has it that the Bloodsail have some new plan cooked up.  All me boys are too busy hitting the grog and looking for ladies!  What I need is a scout.Check the cove just north of Booty Bay along the Savage Coast and see what you find.26610The map shows Booty Bay with a red \"X\" drawn precisely at the spot at which you are standing.The scribbled text reads:\"Set up your command post here, and bide your time.  The Fleet Master will send out word when it's time to make your move.\"\"I'm placing Lieutenant Bruce in charge here.  This time will be different.  This time we take Booty Bay once and for all.\"The map is held in place with a dagger, placed right through the location of Booty Bay.26611Shiver me timbers!  So the Bloodsail Buccaneers are planning some sort of attack on Booty Bay?  Why, the nerve of those scoundrels.  Booty Bay will always be run by the Blackwater Raiders!This is bigger than I thought.  Report what you have learned to Baron Revilgaz at once!  You'll find him here in Booty Bay.26612I want to know details, .  Our supremacy over the Bloodsail is due largely in part to our stronghold here in Booty Bay, but intelligence also plays a critical role.The Bloodsail maintain a few meager camps to the south which they call their \"Southern Command.\"  Well, you're going to raid their excuse for a southern command, find their plans, and slaughter their men.  Return with whatever information you can find.26613Ah, the sea life.  I ain't gonna say it's the good life, but it's my life.When I get into port I like to find me a good bottle of grog and some high quality snuff.  Nasty habits but what's a pirate without his vices, right?So you can imagine how heartbroken I was to find out the herbalist here in town has gone and sold out of the stuff.  Says his shipment got hijacked by those damned Bloodsail Raiders.I bet a fearless  like you could convince 'em to share the goods, eh?26614Avast!  Who goes there?Argh, I am but useless without me special enchanted eye.  Bad enough to have lost me eyes in battle in the first place!  But by some stroke o' luck we docked in Menethil and a traveling wizard enchanted a special glass eye that let me see again.Last night I ended up gettin' jumped by some Bloodsail Buccaneers on me way out.  Took me eye, they did!  Seems those blokes have found their way to Booty Bay.Help an old sea dog out by gettin' me eye back?26616Those Blackrock orcs are gonna need an army to handle the Bravo Company and you, . When you're ready to go, meet us at the dock facing Lake Everstill and we'll set off on my riverboat for Camp Everstill on the other side of the lake.See you there, .26617This old, weathered coin was found on the body of the pirate \"Good-Boy\" Bruce.  Its front side bears the image of a large, unfamiliar pirate ship; on its back side, the term \"Brashtide Crew\".Someone who has been in the piracy business for some time might know what this coin is, or what it means.26618The dire wolves are the most common threat to the townsfolk here. They lurk in the forests on all sides of us, though most are along the north bank of the river.These aren't the runt dogs you see in Elwynn, or wherever you come from. They're big as a man and twice as vicious.If you wish to assist the people of Darkshire, hunt the dire wolves so our streets can be safer.26619If what you say is true, , then we have friends within the Dragonmaw Clan. We can support an insurgency from within their ranks and avoid a lot of bloodshed on both sides.I can help, but the most dangerous part is up to you.My Axebite Warriors will launch an offensive on the shores. During the confusion, I need you to slip behind the lines and speak with your revolutionary contact, Zaela.We'll arm the Dragonmaw and overthrow their fel masters!26620Seasoned wolf kabobs are a house favorite!  Sure, I can make you some.  But first I'll need the supplies.Bring me five wolf skirt steaks.  The dire wolves near the river north of town are good to hunt; I wouldn't stray too far into the woods if I were you.26621The weapons the Horde has supplied us with will be more than enough. The four of us should split up and arm as many Dragonmaw workers and merchants as we can.Don't underestimate us, . You'll find even our tradesmen are ferocious in battle.Let's do as much damage as possible. Arm a squad of Dragonmaw and lay waste to the fel enforcers and warlocks that have intimidated my people for so long. Then meet back here to launch our final strike!26622The time has come. Mor'ghor dies today.Be warned, . Demon blood courses through his wretched veins, and he channels unnatural power. He will be destroyed, yes. But it will not be an easy fight.You remember where Mor'ghor resides, at the top of the camp. I will meet you there. Finish him!Be sure to recruit 3 Dragonmaw followers if you are short - you will need our help.26623I'll let you in on a little secret - Dusky \"Crab\" Cakes are really made from spider meat!  I know it's a bit disgusting, but the cakes have a nice, tangy flavor and make great snacks!If you want to try some still, I'm afraid I'm out of meat. I need some lump meat to whip up a few more cakes.Venom Web Spiders are a good source - they nest to the north, between the foothills and the river.26624These plans are... interesting.  Firallon, you're smarter than this!Look, he has all three ships devoted to cannon fire, and only a few men coming in through the tunnel.  He can never take Booty Bay with three ships and a dozen footmen.  And he knows that.No, they've got something else planned... and you're going to find out what it is.  Speak to Yancey Grillsen, the Bloodsail Recruiter, just to the north of town.That's right, .  You'd better hope that they don't recognize your face.26625You have to put an end to this now!Go back northwest onto the front and kill their battle leader, Troggzor the Earthinator. Bring me his cudgel as proof.26627I've been told there's signs of activity at Beggar's Haunt. People have reported seeing lights in the tower to the east of town.Few would be bold enough to stay that close to Deadwind Pass. You're the first to report since I've learned about this; go check it out and make sure whatever's in there is human.26628This is bad. It seems the Daggerspines are amassing for an attack.Naga are known for their ruthlessness in battle. They will keep attacking until I am dead.I don't value my own life above that of my crew members, but you must help to defend me. The crew will not be able to make it back to Booty Bay without my knowledge of the seas.The naga will be coming from the sea. I need you to remain up here with me to fend off the attack. Man the cannon and drive them back.Are you ready, ?26629Thar be just one thing...Yancey hears things.  A few o' me hearties were pretty deep in their cups when they told me about some   that came a-rollin' through the Southern Command lookin' for charts and orders.  Even ran a couple o' good pirates through,  did.Like I said, they were up to their eyeballs in grog, but still... a buccaneer's gotta trust his ears.  So I've just got one small task for ye, one sent down from Firallon hisself...Bring me the head of Fleet Master Seahorn.26630Firallon wants MY head?  Now that's interesting.  But it's nothing we can't work around.This Yancey character probably doesn't know my face too well.  Most non-tauren find us tauren indistinguishable from one another.  In fact... most non-tauren find us indistinguishable from... a certain four-legged farm creature.Rikqiz the leatherworker keeps one of these creatures here in Booty Bay, and Narkk is my chief supplier for pirate hats.  Get a replacement head and a hat, then return with both.26631Ye may be a slayer of Fleet Masters, but rules is rules and orders is orders.  And MY orders say that all new pirates start out as swabbies.  It's the rule.You're to be working for Captain Keelhaul, the commander of the Riptide.  It's the westernmost ship in the fleet, which is parked south of the tip o' the cape.Find him in his captain's chambers, and bring yer papers.26632Alright, I think I've got it working again. You've got to get the catapult to the stone trogg town, Needlerock Slag, just to the north of the front.The driver will go with you. I'll head back and let Gravel know.There's no doubt that the stone troggs will try to stop you. You just keep them off of the catapult. It packs a big punch.Let me know when you're ready, .26633I want the surface of the Riptide t'shine like a star ruby, Swabbie .  I keep a tight ship around here, and it's swabbies like you that make it happen!Well, what're y'waitin' for, y'cockle-brained bilgerat?  Head updecks and start swabbin'!26634Gum disease.  It's a real problem, .I know you're new and all, and probably haven't ever needed your gums cut, but the rest of us pirates have to deal with a little thing called SCURVY.  It's why we keep so many limes around here.Well... we used to keep limes around here.  Someone made off with our last shipment, but they can't have gone far - maybe to the nearby islands?  Bring them back, and maybe I'll see what I can do to get you promoted from swabbie.26635Help out a fellow swabbie?Keelhaul asked me to gather up some cannonballs at the bottom of the ocean.  Let me tell you why this doesn't work for me.- One: I have tiny arms.  Look at them!  Do you really think I can pick up a cannonball, even underwater?- Two: I have a weak respiratory system.  I start to white out after holding my breath for more than ten seconds.- Three: There are sharks.You gotta help me, !  I've been demoted as far as I can... I don't want to see what comes next!26636We're gonna need some supplies before we take out the Blackrock army and save Redridge. That's where you come in, rookie.Keeshan put me in charge of getting camouflage together for the Bravo Company field kit. What I need you to do is head south and do a little \"gardening.\" There are two parts to this little adventure that you should know about: (1) Leaves and (2) Fox poop. We need 'em both.What did you think camo was made of?Head south and gather what I asked for, .26637The first part of this mission is all covert ops, . To that end, we need to be able to incapacitate the enemy without making any sounds. To do that we're going to need chloroform.The muckdwellers at the bottom of Lake Everstill hold chloroform in their glands. I'm going to need you to go underwater and recover muckdweller glands. Think you can handle it?Come back to me once you've recovered enough glands.Where's the lake you ask? Open your eyes, dummy. Directly west.26638Just south of here on the Lakeridge Highway are a group of Blackrock orcs that stalk the forests under cover of darkness and ambush the uninitiated. That group is the first line of defense for the Blackrock army. They're scouts, reporting everything they see back to their central command. They need to be taken OUT or our mission here could be compromised.Head south and kill every Blackrock hunter that you see.26639Before we do a damned thing we need to get a field kit together. You'll help with that, . There's also a matter of scouting. Thankfully for that we got some help from Stormwind. An old war buddy of mine, Brubaker, was sent here by SI:7 to scout around for us. You're to meet him in the field, just south of here.Meet up with Brubaker and find out what he knows.26640Keeshan, if you're reading this note, I'm dead. Likely that my position was compromised.Orcs are committing unspeakable atrocities against their prisoners. Yes, prisoners, Keeshan. They've got cages full of P.O.W's. If you're gonna blow up this valley, you'll need to free the prisoners first.Tell my wife I love her and to take out the damned trash.-BrubakerPS - They've got black dragons.Take Brubaker's report back to Keeshan.26641The Vilebranch broodguards to the northeast tend the eggs of Shadra's brood. Even if we kill the Vilebranch, those eggs will still sit there, waiting to hatch and release those horrible creatures further into the wilds.We need to take care of this properly. Tear any eggs you see out of the egg sacks and bring them to me. Don't try to destroy them on your own; you might let the little ones out.When you get them back here, I'll see that they're properly disposed of!26642For years, the Barrens have been the heart of the Horde presence on Kalimdor, a vital link between the orcs of Durotar and the tauren settlements in Mulgore.In the chaos of the cataclysm, floods, earthquakes, and even a quilboar invasion threaten to separate us from this vital grassland.You look ready for a challenge. Report to Kargal Battlescar at Far Watch Post and ensure the route to the Barrens remains clear! Head west from nearby Razor Hill and cross the Southfury River to find him.26643The Creeping Ruin to the east is crawling with fully-grown Shadraspawn spiders. They're large enough to drag off an entire dwarf in the night, and you'll see evidence enough of that when you get there... bodies are cocooned all through the ruins.They don't keep them alive for long, , but they feed off the bodies for days. It's too late to save the victims, but we can't let those spiders grow fat and thrive. Make sure you get rid of those cocoons.26644Swabbie !  This is a sad day fer ol' Cap'n Keelhaul.  Today I lose m'best swabbie.A letter's come in from Fleet Master Firallon.  Apparently he's heard about the excellent swabbin' y'been doin', and he wants t'take ye aboard the Crimson Veil as his Jack o' Swords and third mate.  She's moored just next t'the Riptide.Piracy career-wise, this's a big step fer ye, Swabbie .  I recommend y'take his offer.Dismissed!26645I'm afraid you're all I've got to help here, . Stormwind's forces are so taxed by greater evils that they can't spare a single footman to protect Darkshire. It's up to me and the rest of the Night Watch to keep our homes safe.There's more threats here than just wolves, unfortunately. Rotting horrors roam near Blind Mary's Haunt, on the southeast outskirts. If they're not kept in check, they'll be visiting our homes in the night.Deal with the undead and report back to me for your bounty.26646The Bravo Company field kit is ready, . I'm gonna equip you with it and you're gonna enter Render's Valley, southeast of here, and free our P.O.W.s.  I'm sending Jorgensen with you to watch your back.Now the prisoners are being held on the northeast side of the valley in a large cage, but the key to the cage is in a cave on the south side of the valley. You'll have to steal the key, create a distraction, and free the citizens.Good luck, ! I'll be in touch through the field kit.26647We've got some work to do.  How much experience have you got with cannons?  Hmm... really?  Well, how about with ancient, fallin'-apart pirate cannons?We've got a few cannons updecks that work the old-fashioned way: you load one cannonball in at a time, aim, lock it into place, and fire.  Works well if you're tryin' to hit the side of a three-sailer... not so well for rowboats and the like.Why don't you head upstairs and lob a few shots at Smilin' Timmy Sticks?26648Hey, new , take a look at this.I don't wear this patch because of any lost eye.  I wear it because this OTHER eye is so strong, the normal one was just weighin' it down.This eye's good for seein' all kinds of things, like those masked hooligans that follow us around.  Fleet Master says that they've been spotted over on Jaguero Isle.  Once you get there, fire this flare gun, and I'll help you spot 'em.26649Now that you know how to handle our cannons, it's time to hit some real targets!The Venture Company has found gold to the north of here... a rare type they call \"Black Gold\".  More like a Black Spot if you ask me.We're going to take that gold, but first, we need to get rid of those Venture Company goons.  I've got an oarsman who will take you out there.  Head off the ship down the gangplank and speak with him on the islet's northern shore.26650I know ye just arrived here on the Crimson Veil, but I need to send ye off on another task.  The Damsel's Luck is the third ship in me fleet, moored over to the east.  Her skipper - Captain Stillwater - is no longer with us.Damn those masked hoodlums!Anyhow, Ironpatch told me about yer heroics at sea, and I be runnin' low on quality brigands.  I think yer more than capable for this new duty.Congratulations, matey.  Ye be the new captain of the Damsel's Luck.26651Do you understand yet, ? Do you now see what we gotta do to win a war against these monsters? YOU GOTTA BECOME WAR! NO MERCY!With the P.O.W.s freed you're clear to plant the seaforium. Carefully make your way into each of the structures out there and plant a charge.Plant a seaforium charge at the Blackrock munitions hut and the Blackrock tower. Once you're done meet up with me and the rest of Bravo Company at Shalewind Canyon, east of Render's Valley.26652There is a poor, sad spirit, Blind Mary, who haunts an old farm house in the hills south of Darkshire.Here, take this Spectral Comb and ask Blind Mary to comb her hair.  Then bring back the comb and I will glean from it the Ghost Hair I'll need for the thread.And take care, for dark things now lurk near that house...26653Oh, what is a poor old man to do?  I need some supplies from Darkshire, but the village is so far away and I am so old and feeble...I would never make the trip.Can you go to Darkshire and bring me back some ghost hair thread?  You can get it from Madame Eva at her home on the Darkshire square.26654NO!!!!!Take it, take this comb away from me!I'm a monster, and no one will ever think me lovely again!26655Here is your thread, .  It has a thousand uses, from binding evil spirits to sewing life into inanimate objects.26656When Deathwing came, the Stone Dragons flocked to him. In his absence, they are again without purpose. They swarm and feed upon our kin.I have bound dozens of Opalescent Guardians, but am unable to lead them from the safety of cover. I need someone more swift, as I suspect you might be.Lead them by ground towards Therazane's Throne to the east. Surely, some will not make it, but as long as you keep moving, you should be able to bring several to join our forces there.26657Stone Dragons bow only to strength. When we have punished them enough, they will bend back to our will.I have sent many of my strongest giants onto the fields in the west. They will bring the drakes to the ground. You will see to it that they do not take wing again after they fall.26658It is now time to draw the Broodmother's attention. To do so, we will need a mallet that the troggs use when making offerings to her.Seek out the Stone Trogg Beast Tamers that are attempting to tame basilisks in the southern portions of the Pale Roost. You will find a mallet on one of their corpses.26659On the western edge of the Pale Roost, you will find a resonating crystal. Strike it with the mallet and the broodmother will come.Be ready for battle. I will be there to aid you, but she will not be easily overcome.26660I need a bottle of a certain liquor - Zombie Juice.  Tavernkeep Smitts at the Scarlet Raven Tavern in Darkshire should have some.And please hurry, .  These nights get cold, and I need that drink to put fire in my veins again!26661If you bring me some rot blossoms then I can brew you up a batch of zombie juice.Rot blossoms grow in strange places.  They tend to flourish on dead things, and Duskwood has its fair share of those!I've seen a few of them growing at Tranquil Gardens Cemetery lately. Check near the graves... but mind the dead that are walking about near there.26662The charts mention a group called the Brashtide Crew.  This name is new to you, though you've heard about a few other newcomers to the Buccaneers.Maybe it's time you paid them a visit and found out what they know.26663The attack on Booty Bay is looming.  You'll have to return to Booty Bay quickly and inform the Baron.First, however, it might be a good idea to sabotage some of the pirates' supplies while you're still in their favor.  The pirates keep most of their supplies belowdecks, spread out across the entire fleet.26664Before returning to Booty Bay, you should do everything you can to weaken the Bloodsail Buccaneers.  Unfortunately, even as captain, you're prohibited from killing other buccaneers in cold blood.  Only a Fleet Master can do that.You can, however, put mutineers to the sword... and mutiny can be awfully hard to disprove.Speaking of which, those Bloodsail corsairs that hang out on the lowest level of the ships have been acting awfully suspicious...26665You feel like you've done just about enough damage, and you know the Bloodsail's battle plans.  You've done everything that Baron Revilgaz has asked of you.It's time to hang up the pirate hat and return to Booty Bay.  The battle looms near.26666I'm here because I received a letter from my brother Stalvan, who I haven't seen in years. On arriving here, I was told he was dead...The entire town refuses to offer any further explanation. Any mention of his name is met with terror and suspicion. As if I didn't have enough of that myself!I'm afraid of what will happen if my frustration and anger grows any further. I beg you, help me get to the bottom of this. Implore Clerk Daltry for any information he may have on my brother.26667You want to know about Stalvan...You're not the first, you know. We get outsiders coming through asking about him every so often. Always outsiders. Everyone who lives here knows better.You're out of luck, anyway. I'm missing half the archives. Feral worgen broke into the town hall not a few nights ago and tore the place to shreds.The documents you'll want are probably strewn all across Brightwood Grove by now, deep in the woods to the west. Not worth it if you ask me.26668Those explosives you planted were high yield, . When I push this button on the Bravo Company field kit, that whole valley is gonna be consumed by a massive fireball of death.You know, I think you should do the honors. You did all the hard work, after all.Ready?26669If you're that serious about this, I'll help you, . I know where the other documents must be. I'm just too terrified to do anything about it.There's only a few places that those horrible Nightbane beasts gather when they're not prowling the forest. One of them's the Rotting Orchard to the south. They use the buildings there as their dens, so if they haven't just eaten the other documents, you might find one there... but you'll have to search their lairs thoroughly, I wager.26670This isn't all of it...You should let it go, . The only place left to look is Roland's Doom. That's the mine south of town, and the largest lair of worgen in Duskwood. Nobody in Darkshire has ever made it back from that place alive. In fact, some of the records I have here imply that's where the monsters first came from... who knows what evil's lurking in there?Please, , just give it up. Let's just forget about this whole thing, and never speak of it again.26671You've recovered everything. Everything except the last page......which I've got right here. Don't look at me like that. You'll understand when you read it. Some even say it's cursed, you know. In fact, I was relieved when the worgen broke in and made off with these!Take it. Take all of it, in fact. I thank you for recovering my archives, but I don't want anything to do with this ever again. Please, just leave me be.26672This can't be. My brother was strong-willed, but such vileness... such sickness and violent, bloody evil...I must have answers. I need to know how I got that letter. I need to know if Stalvan really did this.I need to know why...Take my ring, . Bring it to Madame Eva. That woman is a follower of old arts and makes no secret of it... call it madness, but I'll try anything at this point.26674I'm afraid I cannot give Tobias the answers he seeks. But I can help you find the only person who can...Stalvan Mistmantle.Take the ring into the woods to the east, to Manor Mistmantle, where Stalvan's body was buried. Enter, and hold the ring before you. Let the waning moon pour its light through the ring, and the spirits will answer your call.Take heed, . The questions of the living can offer more comfort than the answers of the dead.26676Here's your Zombie Juice......and be careful with this stuff.  It's strong enough to raise the dead!26677Out here on the outskirts of town, it's a wonder the walking dead haven't eaten me!  In fact, just yesterday a pack of ghouls was pounding on the walls of my tower!I want to make an effigy - a kind of \"scarecrow\" for ghouls.  To do that I need some ghoul ribs.  You can find plenty of them on the fetid corpses wandering Manor Mistmantle's grounds, north of Darkshire...Get the ribs for me, and I will repay you with some coin.26678  Even with all my suspicions about Firallon's plot, we aren't prepared for a full two-front attack between the Bloodsail and the Brashtide.  It's going to take a small miracle to hold Booty Bay today.I've got a barrel of Doublerum in my chambers.  Take the stairs down three flights, and check the first door on your right.  You can ignore the warnings on the barrel... those should be the least of your worries.26679Something is happening outside.  Could the Bloodsail already be here?You'd better get Revilgaz his doublerum.  Quickly.26680A few weeks ago I was picking herbs far from my house, and a band of ogres attacked me!  I ran, and I was forced to leave behind a crate of precious tools and herbs.After they chased me off, the ogres swaggered back to the ogre mound in southern Duskwood.  I'm sure my crate is somewhere near the mound.Please, , retrieve this crate for me for I miss it sorely.26681Take this note to Ello Ebonlocke, the Mayor of Darkshire.He and I are old friends...and when he reads it and discovers what you did for me...I'm sure he'll be just as happy as I am!  Hahahaha!26682Dustwallow is Horde territory, . The humans may have their little island and their precious sand bar, but the marsh belongs to us.In time, we will surely win this stalemate with the humans. For now, we must master our own territory. The withervine bog beasts to the north rise from the marsh itself to attack any living thing that approaches. If we own this marsh, we must not let our own land fight back against us!Slay the bog beasts, if you wish to serve the Horde. You will be rewarded.26683My gnomish friend, Cog, has promised to help me build a device which will let me peer towards the stars. According to Cog's blueprint, what I need first is a way to reflect light.I remember a woman by the name of Mary who became well known around these parts for always carrying a looking glass.  Perhaps you can track Mary down and see if she might lend us a reflective surface for this project?  I believe she once resided in southern Duskwood. . .26684The looking glass was one of my finest treasures until. . .the incident.  After that happened, I discarded it behind the barn.  There was an insane ghoul who used to roam back there.  Perhaps he picked it up.  Rumor has it the devilish beast resides in the Tranquil Gardens Cemetery.26685Now there is just one more item needed to complete this device.  Cog's blueprint calls for a lens of some sort.  The only lens I know of that would be large enough will be very difficult to acquire.There is an ogre by the name of Zzarc'Vul who resides in the mound in southern Duskwood.  If you can, bring to me his monocle and I will use that as our lens!26686There's even fouler undead left to deal with, .Tranquil Gardens Cemetery, further south of town, is a place you don't want to be caught in at night. The bones that rise from the ground there are cunning enough to remember how to swing an axe or cast a spell.I shouldn't need to explain how dangerous that makes them. Proceed with caution, but remember the people of Darkshire that will suffer if you falter.26687Hawthorne dead... my own son murdered... the situation in the Barrens is out of control, .I'm going to take charge of Fort Triumph and try to lock things down. To do that, I'm going to need reinforcements. Reinforcements that were promised from Theramore weeks ago!Travel to Theramore in Dustwallow Marsh and give Captain Garran Vimes an earful. What good is that blasted road through the swamp if the men and materiel aren't rolling in?26688Darkness seems drawn inexorably to Duskwood. Master Carevin's quest is the expulsion of evil and heresy. Through our efforts are the people of Darkshire kept safe.You believe yourself worthy to join us?I once thought as you. Disillusioned by the complacency of the Watch, I joined Master Carevin. If you wish to prove yourself, it will not be through words.Test your skills against the Nightbane worgen in Brightwood Grove. We'll see if you have what it takes to hunt these monsters.26689The worgen infestation stretches further than Brightwood Grove. To the south, on the very edges of Darkshire itself, the Rotting Orchard is host to even more of the savage beasts.The worgen there are more cunning, , but just as savage and evil. They conjure foul shadows to tear their enemies apart from a distance. Go to the Rotting Orchard, and slay the Shadow Weavers to keep the town safe!26690Your previous accomplishments have convinced me that you are ready to take on the toughest worgen infesting the woods.Of the worgen that have made their new home here, the Vile Fangs and the Tainted Ones have proven the most dangerous. They've settled down near some of the caves and in the mine to the south.From far away you can even see the light from their bonfires...26691Here you go, . Bring this message to Master Carevin.A few more like you, and we will outnumber the Night Watch! Perhaps then we could complete the work that we few carry on today.26692Now that every Blackrock orc south of Lake Everstill is nothing more than ash and cinder, we can turn our attention to the Shadowhide gnoll army of Galardell Valley, directly north of here.I want you to head out there and kill 'em all, ! Initiate Operation: Extinction, soldier. For Bravo Company and for the Alliance!26693We got lucky with some vital intelligence from the locals of this valley. Those two behind us, the Ranthals, have informed me that the gnolls in Galardell Valley are being controlled by a powerful magus in the tower of Ilgalar. The problem is that the tower is sealed by a magical force field.The first thing we need to do is get the key that will get you inside. The gnoll general, Fangore, has your ticket inside. Kill General Fangore and get the key.I'll be in touch.26694Good work, kid. I've got some vital intel for you. The magus in the tower is a human named Doane. Damned traitor is working for the Blackrock orcs. I want him dead.Use the key of Ilgalar and get inside that tower. Work your way to the top and show Doane what Bravo Company does with traitors.Rendezvous back at Shalewind Canyon when the deed is done.Keeshan, over and out.26695I've got an idea, but it's going to involve some footwork on your part.  As a goblin cartel, the Blackwater Raiders have a lot of explosives on hand.  In fact, I know for a fact that our old friend Narkk keeps a case in the back of his shop, in the Old Port Authority.Go grab them and bring them here, if they haven't already exploded.26696Say, you haven't seen a fish about this long?  Short fins?  Responds to the name Steve?  He's blue?Never mind, I'll keep looking.Actually... there was another reason I came here to Booty Bay.  Boss Krog, over in Dustwallow, is looking for new blood.  Someone to help us Stonemaul from getting overrun.  You look strong enough.Wait on the edge of the pier for the next ship, then ride to Ratchet.  Gazlowe should be able to help you from there.Steve?  Steve!26697We'll never survive this attack with all these worgen pirates pouring into the harbor from the north.  Luckily, it looks like they're not armed with cannons, so if we can get you out of the harbor, you can attack from the skies.Kebok, the Horde flight master's assistant, is right around the corner.  Talk to him and let him know that you're going to need his bravest wind rider.Bring a couple armloads of handbombs with you.  You'll need all of them to stop those attack boats!26698When the Brashtide pulled in, Seahorn grabbed the nearest weapon he could find and jumped off the ledge here.  You'll find him down below, probably pounding new holes into those worgen's skulls.Help him out down there.  I can handle the motivation from up here.26699The Brashtide are everywhere!  The Baron's Booty Bay Bruisers are no match for their sheer numbers, I'm afraid.While you're down here in the fray, why don't you help me get rid of a few of them?When you're done, don't bother coming back here.  I'll probably be pretty busy.26700I heard that this ship here is the Damsel's Luck.  Didn't you used to be the captain of that thing?  You must know your way around it, then.The Brashtide are our main concern, but we still don't want to take an unnecessary pummeling from those cannons of theirs.  Grab this rope behind me and take out some of those angry-looking corsairs.  Check in with the Baron when you're done.26701Listen, I got no special love for the Horde... but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either.Your gold is as good as anyone else's.That two-headed ogre and his pet fish left some gold for your travel costs.  I believe the person you're looking for in Dustwallow goes by the name of Krog.  And the best way to get there is to talk to our flight master, Bragok.  He'll fly you there, if you want.  The flight's free, thanks to your friend.26702Listen, I got no special love for the Alliance... but then again, I got no real hate for you guys either.Your gold is as good as anyone else's.  Sometimes better.Jeyne left some gold for your travel costs.  I believe the person you're looking for in Dustwallow goes by the name of Calia Hastings.  And the best way to get there is to talk to our flight master, Bragok.  He'll fly you there, if you want.  The flight's free, thanks to your friend.26703We've nearly won the day, largely thanks to you.  One task remains, however... kill Fleet Master Firallon.It looks like most of Firallon's crew is already dead, but I know that old sea dog well enough to know that he's not done yet.  No, he's cooped up tight in his cabin, ready to go down with his ship.Speak with Kebok again to get a wind rider.  I'll try to hold off the cannonfire while you're on board.26706We need to get rid of that flying gunship if our people have any chance of escaping.Here's the plan.  Keel Harbor had its share of rebel sympathizers in the old days.  I've managed to round up a hefty amount of incendiary explosives from one of our storehouses.We're going to hit the enemy with a force small enough to fly undetected.  The night elf hippogryphs should do the trick.Tobias will give you the signal when we're ready to go.26707I need large amounts of corpseweed for Master Harris's concoctions. It's difficult to obtain, but we can't let our supply dwindle.Corpseweed is tough stuff to tangle with... the plant will get you before you get it, if you're not careful! But if you'd like to help out, I'll eagerly pay you for any you gather yourself.You'll find plenty of it all over the Yorgen Stead to the southeast.26708I'm here to help you and Bravo Company end this mess. You're to get in the Bravo Company siege tank and clear a path to Keeshan's Post on the other side of the valley, north of here.This is a high alert situation soldier as the Blackrock orcs are now aware of your location and sending a large force to meet you head on. Terminate them all with extreme prejudice.I'll see you on the other side. May the Light have mercy on your soul.26709I am returning to my throne. I've no desire to see any more of these Earthen Ring, but you remain welcome here, . If you wish to help us rebuild our realm, perhaps we can help you in return.All things in time.26710Pebble has gotten himself lost again, somewhere deep in the Crumbling Depths.He's fortunate that his size makes him unworthy of the effort for those gyreworms, but it's only a matter of time before he stumbles too close to one and gets eaten. Whatever he's so intent on down there is certainly not worth it.He seems to like you. Please, go and find him and bring him out of those tunnels to safer playing grounds.26711Yo, baby. Wassup? You ready for the party?No?! You know I love you, so I don't know how to say this, but check it... I think you need to swing into town to buy a new outfit for the party.Don't look at me like that... you want to look gooood, right? Don't you want to look super fine for me? I am your boyfriend after all!Swing by the bank first and pull out plenty of macaroons. You don't want to buy any of that cheap stuff!26712Hi, babe. Are you ready for the party?No?! You know I love you, right? I think you need to swing into town and buy a new outfit for the party.Don't look at me like that... you want to look your best? Don't you want to look good for me? I am your girlfriend after all!Make sure you swing by the bank first and pull out plenty of macaroons. Don't buy any of that cheap stuff!26713Only the Blackrock high command remains, . They're all holed up in Stonewatch Keep, directly south of our position here at Keeshan's Post. I want you and the rest of Bravo Company to enter Stonewatch and put an end to the Blackrock orc invasion., no survivors.26714As Troteman cuts out, the world around you grows eerily silent. In the distance you see a full grown black dragon!26717My kinsmen at Raven Hill are concerned with curing the feral worgen in these forests. The condition itself cannot be lifted, but sanity can be restored to those not too far gone.While most here have proven beyond help, we keep an eye out for those that retain vestiges of their minds... attachments to their old lives.I've seen a lone worgen lurking the Yorgen Farmstead, digging in a pile of dirt between the buildings...could you check out that pile and see if he's left anything?26718Something bad happened.26719Master Harris will want to know of this immediately.Here, take this package of corpseweed down the road to the camp at Raven Hill. Tell him what we saw at the Yorgen Stead.26720What we do here is not a cure. The transformation cannot be removed once inflicted. But the mind...The mind can be restored, through alchemy,  if enough is left intact. This worgen you've encountered sounds like he's fighting to stay aware, . We've got to find him again.If he's fled the Yorgen Stead, search the Addle Stead to the south; he may be lurking in one of the buildings.Inject him with this ampule to tranquilize him. You'll need to be quite close.26721M-Master Harris requires many reagents for his serums. He has me gather them for him.Most of it's not so bad... I mean, the corpseweed is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as the widow venom. Have you seen the widows around here? The hatchlings are the size of a man. Even with a gun, I can't stand to go out hunting them!It's just too terrifying. If you'll go do it for me, I'll gladly pay you! Just bring me back some widow venom! You'll find them all in the woods to the east, just north of the road.2672226723Before I was lost to the woods, the last thing I remember is Morbent Fel. He was a vile necromancer, and the reason this land swarms with so many vile undead.I asked an adventurer to help me put an end to him. I thought they did! But Sister Elsington tells me the land still crawls with ghouls and spectres ripped from the grave.Morbent Fel should have breathed his last in the house on Forlorn Rowe, north of Raven Hill Cemetary. Go there and see what's become of him...26724The others here share my suspicion. Morbent Fel lives on in undeath...and may be even more powerful than before. A necromancer was struck down, but a lich may have risen in his place. And now he continues to ruin this land.I remember Duskwood before all this, . I remember bright skies and peaceful woods. This can't stand! Morbent Fel must be stopped for good.Speak to Sister Elsington. Her vision might guide you to where Morbent Fel is, and how he can be defeated.26725Sven is correct. I can feel the presence of a powerful evil deep beneath the Raven Hill Cemetery. Evil lurks in its catacombs, and Morbent Fel must be the source.You will need the power of the Light to strike him down, . Sven told me the heroes who first slew Morbent Fel wielded an artifact of lightforged iron, imbued with holy power. That artifact is still here!I can feel it as well, a glimmer of light amidst the darkness. Search Raven Hill for it, and let the Light guide you through it.26726Return to Lakeshire and let Solomon know that the Blackrock invasion has been stopped. Make sure he understands the cost at which our freedom came - that we lost five of our finest heroes to save Redridge and ultimately, Stormwind.You are the last surviving member of Bravo Company, . It is up to you to keep its legacy alive.Dismissed.26727You're not the first fool to be manipulated by Abercrombie! That doddering old man is known as The Embalmer to us. He's a vile necromancer and a blight upon this town.And now, sewn together and given life by the very materials you brought him, his horrible creation approaches!That hideous creature will be upon us in mere moments! If you have any heart, , you'll help the Night Watch drive off the abomination and save our town!26728, the citizens of Duskwood are in dire need of your assistance! I have here a letter from Commander Althea Ebonlocke, leader of the Night Watch, pleading for help.To reach Darkshire you should travel across the bridge located in the southwest corner of Redridge. Once you cross the bridge you will be in Duskwood. Then you just follow the road to Darkshire. Beware of the savage beasts that stalk the countryside!26729I arrived in Stranglethorn to study a feature known as the Altar of Naias, but made the unfortunate choice of denying Colonel Kurzen's advances, which earned me several years in that cage.  Now that I'm out, I figure I might as well continue with my original studies.The altar is on an island to the west, south of Zul'Kunda.  Gather some of the bracers from the island's water elementals.Oh, and you can use this device when you're finished.  No need to make you walk all the way back here.26730I need something to cut into the raw, elemental power of these bracers... something strong and abrasive, but still of the sea.The Murkgill murlocs have moved inland from the sea, but they still carry vials of sea salt on them.  What they use it for, I can't be sure, but it will serve for our studies.  You can find the Murkgill in the glade south of the Rebel Camp and east of Bal'lal ruins.26731The salt you brought was sufficient to activate the bracers' innate enchantments.  I have taken these enchantments and combined them into a summoning token... a gift, if you will.Return to the Isle of Naias, and place the gift on Naias' altar.  Call me again once you have Naias' heart.26732I have a feeling that Kurzen's Medicine Men are distributing more than just medicine.  Kurzen needs some way to quelch insubordination, and an elixir under the guise of \"medicine\" would be the perfect way to do that.We need those remedies for research.  Search the Kurzen Compound to the southeast - his medicine men and jungle fighters should carry the remedies on their bodies.26733This... this is just basilisk blood!No, it's mostly basilisk blood.  They've added something to it though.  I'll need a control sample to perform a proper comparison.They most likely obtained the blood from the crystal spine basilisks, found to the east of their compound.  Bring me back some pure samples, and I'll have this elixir figured out.26734After reducing the basilisk blood out of the elixir, I've uncovered an unusual precipitate.  It appears to be a blue crystal of some sort...It's not a singing blue crystal... not a pulsing blue shard...... not a piece of the Mind's Eye.  Nope, this isn't something we've seen before in Stranglethorn.  If anyone has any more of this substance, I want it.  Check the high-ranking Kurzen troops, in the back of their cave.26735Hello, .We are soldiers of Stormwind, and rebels from Kurzen's Compound, a large outpost that you'll find just to the southeast of here.  We were under the command of Colonel Kurzen, until he and those close to him started to descend into madness...We rebelled, set up camp here, and stood against Kurzen.  Now, my sources are telling me Kurzen has disappeared.  I trust my source, but it would help to hear from a third party.  Please, head into the compound and find some documentation of his fate.26736Kurzen's death is a relief, but what's more interesting, and perhaps more immediate, is the sign of some potential allies within the compound.I don't care what it says on that prison record, I know EXACTLY why those 3 were locked up: refusal to follow orders.  They must have been spared from the madness, much like my fellow rebels here, and incarcerated for speaking up.Find them, .  Find them, and send them back here.26737Now that our allies have been evacuated, it's time to run a final raid on Kurzen's Compound.  They will never be weaker than they are right now, and with your help, we may be able to weaken them beyond repair.Those four names that were listed in the Officers' Dossier - Anders, Gaulus, Miranda, and Esquivel - will be the highest-ranking personnel remaining.  Look for them in that cave in the back of their compound.  Removing all four will be devastating to Kurzen's forces.Go with honor, .26738While looking through this soldier's possessions, you look down to see a newborn raptor hatchling looking back up at you.  Was it following this Kurzen militiaman the whole time?You can see it studying you, learning your features and following your movements.The lashtail hatchling has formed a bond with you.Perhaps someone back at the Rebel Camp will know what to do with a raptor hatchling.26739It looks like your young raptor is hungry.  If you're looking to keep her, why don't you find something for her to eat?  The lashtail often attack the basilisks of Stranglethorn, which can be found to the east, beyond Kurzen's Compound.She probably isn't strong enough to hunt on her own yet, but I'm sure she will eat freshly killed basilisk meat.26740I do most of the cooking at the camp.  It used to be a lot of work, until I bought a mechanical cooking pot from a goblin merchant.  The pot is a wonder!  It saved me countless hours...until it broke!Can you take the pot back to the goblin for me so he can fix it?  His name is Krazek.  Last I heard, he was staying with Nesingwary in the hunters' camp just to the south.26742I never got to properly thank you for saving me.Thank you, .I'm still a little fatigued from my captivity, so I thought you might help me with my studies.  As a shaman of the Wildhammer clan, I'm very interested in the shamanic practices of the Bloodscalp tribe.Their magic seems to have diverged in an interesting direction.  If I had one of the totems that their shaman use, I could begin my studies.  You'll find them at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest.26743Ahh... these must be names of their totemic creatures - the animals that they attribute to the spirits.  Let's see... Mahamba as water, Tsul'Kalu as earth, Pogeyan as... air?  Fire?  I can't make this part out.I'd like some more information on these spirits of theirs.  The Bloodscalp have a camp close to here, in the Tkashi ruins.  Maybe you can find some details there.26744On a somewhat unrelated note, I've been putting together a collection of troll stories and legends for a... personal project.  I was just thinking you might be able to help me find some of them.The Bloodscalps at the Bal'lal ruins, on the coast to the southwest, maintain a large tablet documenting some of their stories.  Of course, I'll reimburse you if you're able to bring any of these stories back to me.26745Your pet raptor seems to have found a new toy: a skull, from a nearby troll skull pile.What sets this skull apart from the rest is beyond you, but for some reason, she won't put it down.Osborn Obnoticus, the gnome you saved from Kurzen's Compound, is an expert in troll history and physiology.  Maybe he'll have some idea what makes this one so special.26746In life, he was strong, powerful, a lord among trolls.  With our help, he can be a lord once more.The Bloodscalp scavengers that wander the ruins to the southwest hoard magical fetishes that can help us.  They hide these artifacts under the ground.  Use your hatchling to find these artifacts, ... then bring them here.26747The soul is ready, but the body is not.  For a skull as well-formed, as marvelous, as beautiful as this... we will need a suitable body.The chief of the Bloodscalps, Gan'zulah, won his throne with brute force.  If he still lives, you'll find him in Zul'Kunda, to the west.Taking his body won't be easy, but nothing a sturdy  like yourself couldn't handle.  Bring it back here when you're done.26748.  You just resurrected your worst nightmare.  You didn't think I was a friend, did you, ?  Ah, ha ha haaaa!You've served your purpose.  I've returned to the realm of the living, and it's all thanks to you.  So, instead of killing you, I'm going to make you a deal instead.Give me that raptor.You must already know that she's no normal raptor, and I need a replacement for Ohgan.  Do it, or both you and the gnome will taste my rage.26749Thank you, .  I know you didn't have to save my life.The return of Bloodlord Mandokir is ill news.  He was killed inside Zul'Gurub several years ago, and we thought we had seen the last of him and his kind.  The trolls of Zul'Gurub were attempting to perform a hideous, horrible ritual.  If Mandokir is alive, then it stands to reason that he is not the only one.The explorers at Fort Livingston, far to the south, may know more.  Speak with their priestess.26750It is time. The Stonemother will speak with you. You can find her throne in northern Deepholm, above the Scoured Reach.26751I understand you may be headed to Zul'Kunda soon.  While you are there, I have a small task for you.The trolls are outgrowing Stranglethorn.  The Bloodscalp in the West, the Skullsplitters in the East... they pour out of their ruins and into the jungle, disrupting the natural balance of the region.  It is time we restored that balance.Zul'Kunda is the Bloodscalp capital.  Inside you will find the most high-ranking Bloodscalps.  Reduce their numbers, then return to me.26752Stay where you are, champion. I have not yet decided what to do with you or your Earthen Ring.267532675426755Oh good, you brought another catapult with you! Clay might be older than dirt, but he makes a mean war machine.Well, you didn't bring it all the way out here for your health, flesh bag. Get in one of those things and bombard the fungal terrors and reinforcements streaming out of Needlerock Slag.We have to keep them off the front!26760I'm hopeful, but let's remain professional. It's business as usual for this one.Into the guillotine he goes... and if the alchemy doesn't take, he won't be getting back out of it.Jitters and I will attend to this. Please, just stand back and watch from a safe distance.26761There is no doubt that the Defias pose a great threat to the kingdom, but we certainly cannot enter their hideout and hope that everything will work itself out. No, an assault against the Defias is going to take time and planning. I want you to leave the logistics to me. Our kingdom has other threats that must be dealt with immediately!Travel east through Elwynn to Redridge and report to Magistrate Solomon in Lakeshire. I will call for you when we are ready to attack the Defias.26762We sent a number of our war constructs north into Needlerock Slag, but none of them ever returned. We know that the stone trogg mystics have done something to them.What we're concerned about is that the mystics will control and turn them against us, like they have with the fungal giants., go into the stone trogg town and reactivate the constructs.26763If I'm going to repair this pot, I'm going to need reagents.  And to get them, you're going to have to do an eensy little bit of killing.  I hope you don't mind.Those dastardly Venture Company geologists have been collecting some tumbled crystals that will suffice for what I need.  You'll find them around their Base Camp, on the other side of Lake Nazferiti, to the east.I don't care what you have to do to get them.26764You may notice that the Venture Company has completely clear-cut all the trees around their Base Camp to the east.  Not one to miss out an opportunity for profit, their foreman has enslaved druids, and is forcing them to re-grow the forest so they can chop it down again!Personally, I find this abhorrent, and not just because I didn't think of it first.Release a few of these druids from their captors.  I'm sure they'll appreciate it.26765So, this pot is fixed.  I even added an extra steam whistle, and look!  There's a new chopper at the bottom that'll cut through leg bones!Yes yes, Krazek's Crock Pot is a 100% cook pleaser!  I'm sure its owner will be satisfied.26766We're only going to get one shot at capturing Abyssion, .  Let's make it count.We'll test out the trap on the biggest of the stone dragons in the Alabaster Shelf.To lure the stone matriarch, we're going to need to gather sufficient bait.Take this knife and carve 5 sides of basilisk meat.  That ought to be enough even for her appetite.26768Having a dragon guard the fragment was a smart move on the enemy's part.  They can keep moving its location any time we get close to it.Catching Abyssion will be extremely difficult, but I have a plan that might help.The Twilight's Hammer uses magical traps to bind stone drakes to the ground while they drain their energy.If we can get our hands on one of these, we might be able to ground the Twilight Dragon for just long enough.Go east of here, to the Alabaster Shelf, and obtain a trap.26769Enjoy your cut of the loot, !I hate to share, but business is business. And that double-dealer Nozzlepot is guaranteed a 10% cut of this treasure. Can you deliver this to him at his outpost in the north?He's got a little research station upstream, along the river. If you travel just northeast of town here, Horton Hornblower can give you a free ride on one of his riverboats. Tell him I sent ya!26770The Needlerock mystics have taken control of the fungal giants that have sprouted in their chasm, down below. Now they seek to control our war constructs.Go north into Needlerock Slag and do something about it! Isn't that what you're here for?26771You must set the trap for the matriarch now.Go to the western end of the Alabaster Shelf and place the trapped basilisk meat in the center of the feeding grounds.26772To know Mandokir, you must see Mandokir.To see Mandokir, you must use eyes of raptor.You have formed bond with raptor: Ohgan'aka: daughter of Ohgan.To strengthen bond, we need feathers.You will go northeast, and you will find the feathers, yes.26773We have the feathers, yes.We have the , yes.Speak with Priestess when you are ready.26774Mind Vision is not enough, no.Mind Control, much more powerful magic, yes.Powerful magic needs powerful reagents, and troll brain is a powerful reagent.Braddok in Zul'Mamwe, very smart, yes.Head south, and check out the big brain on Braddok.26775Mind Control, very powerful, yes.With luck, you can help Ohgan'aka escape from Zul'Gurub.Then, Ohgan'aka becomes 'aka again!Speak to Priestess, yes, and help 'aka escape.26776Priestess is not very good at speaking Common, no.Maybe you go speak with Ghaliri, in front of that tent.Tell him about what you've seen inside Zul'Gurub, yes.26777This is a tragic land, with a history of violence and despair. While many of the dead roam in the flesh, some are simply lost souls, wandering in confusion.They deserve to be put at ease.Many of these souls gather at the Addle Stead to the south, appearing before travelers. Take this censer of holy incense. Sway it before the forlorn spirits, and let the offering of its gentle scent give them peace.26778Can you hear them, ? There's so many of them. They wander their graves, shuffling across the cold ground on rotting limbs.The dead cry out in the still air. They suffer in their own flesh, forced from sleep! Every night I venture to the graveyard to put more of them to rest, but it's never enough.Help me, . Put the ghouls that swarm Raven Hill Cemetery out of their misery. Strike down as many as you can.26779The Skullsplitters are an embarrassment to the troll empire.  Their petty squabbles with the Bloodscalps have torn Northern Stranglethorn apart.  Where tribes like the Darkspear and the Zandalari thrive, the Skullsplitters fight over ruins.I have been authorized to issue rewards to mercenaries who are willing to deliver punishment to the Skullsplitters.  I encourage you, and anyone you know, to travel east into Zul'Mamwe and cull their wayward tribe.26780Nighttime in Stranglethorn is a beautiful thing.  The skies fill with stars, and the moon casts its rays right between those leaves, right there.  I could stare at these skies all night.Unfortunately, the trolls that walk the ruins of Zul'Mamwe are interfering with my astronomy.  They burn braziers, day and night, which rob me of the darkness I need.Please, ... travel east into Zul'Mamwe and put them out.26781One of the Vale's many treasures lies nearby, on OUR side of the giant whirlpool.  The Mind's Eye is held by an ogre mage, in the Mosh'Ogg ogre mound just to the northeast.  His name is Mai'Zoth.  From what I understand, he is vicious, and his magic is strong.And if he has the Mind's Eye, then his magic will be stronger still.Thus far I've been unable to get near enough to take it from him.  Will you give it a try?26782There's been some activity up north, at the rebel camp.  I just heard from a soldier named Nimetz that some   up there found the key to what's been driving them so crazy.  That wasn't you, was it?Anyhow, he sent a sample to me, and it looks just like the rocks I've been seeing over at the Mosh'Ogg Ogre Mound, to the northeast.I've heard that the ogres are guarding a chest up in some ruins behind their mound.  I suspect it may be related.  Care to fetch it for me?26783There's been some activity up north, at the rebel camp.

It is why the Twilight's Hammer chose to build their stronghold here.In the right hands, we can channel this energy into something productive... like a portal directly to Orgrimmar.Northwest of here, at the Verrall River Delta, water elementals have been stirred up by the actions of our foes upstream. Destroy them and gather 5 whirlpool cores. You'll not only calm the river, you'll power up our portal.26785I've been trying to keep my true self hidden away from the people of Darkshire... they seem to react poorly to worgen. There are more of us here, though, beyond the city.The companions I first traveled here with search the woods for wild worgen. They believe some of them, ones with telltale signs, can still be returned to sanity.I'm not quite ready to rejoin them. Please send word to Apprentice Fess at the crossroads west of town that I'll be staying in Darkshire a while longer.26786Something troubles me, . The Twilight dragons knew just where and when to strike our airfleet. It's as if they knew our plans.Twilight spies cower within our midst!I'm going to take one of our remaining ships back to Orgrimmar to roll some heads. I need you to stay behind and secure this front. The Dragonmaw shaman are powerful; I have asked them to open up a portal to Orgrimmar, and I need you to help.So. Start helping!26787I'm afraid that... well, I'm just plain afraid, but I'm also sorry to have to ask for another favor.Master Harris needs brains. Bear brains. They're part of the serum apparently, or at least a proper substitute.There's plenty of black bears in the woods to the west, and along the riverbank, but... I can't do it! I'm too terrified to go out there and face those huge things, even with a rifle. Please, let me pay you to bring back some!26788Our alliance with the Dragonmaw is secured, but this port is far from combat ready. These flimsy wooden walls are an embarrassment to the Warchief.When water elementals carve their way through rock, as they have in the Verrall River, they create a peculiar kind of muck. It spreads easily and dries harder than the hardest stone. It's the perfect mortar for large-scale construction.Go to the river delta northwest of here and collect some Verrall River muck. Even a little will go a long way.26791The stone trogg mystics are creating those fungal monstrosities from the giant mushrooms to the north.I want you to take a war guardian to help deal with the giants and stone troggs. Make your way to the giant mushrooms and target them. I and my geomancers will sink them into the ground before the mystics have a chance to finish their ritual.26792Grab yourself a war guardian, and destroy those fungal monstrosities while you're out there.26793The weathered grave marker reads simply:MORGAN LADIMORE26794If you would like to know more, you might ask Althea, she's been the one to handle the... trouble... with him of late.26795From what my scouts tell me, Mor'Ladim wanders throughout Duskwood, following a strange and meandering path through the cemetery. We buried him out past the house on the hill, you know where that is?There isn't anything I can do to help you, but I wish you good luck.26796I should have told you this earlier...How do I put this...Morgan may have believed that his family was all dead, but, in fact, his daughter Sarah Ladimore is now a Watcher. She's always been troubled by the... circumstances... surrounding her father's death. Perhaps you could go to bring the news to her.26797Here, take this and lay it on his grave. Maybe... somehow, he'll know that I'm okay, and that none of us hold him responsible for what happened.And... thank you, .26798The portal is ready!It's not powerful enough to transport an army, but we can maintain the connection long enough to allow important individuals to pass back and forth.The Warchief will want to know about our progress here. Walk through the portal to Orgrimmar, then deliver the news to Garrosh Hellscream.26799The val'kyr raise hundreds of corpses every day.  Agatha raised you just a few moments ago.  Not all are as lucky as you, however.Some maintain their free will, but live in constant fear and confusion.  They usually run off into the woods, cowering at their own reflections.Others lose their minds completely, shambling about aimlessly.  They often turn to violence, and must be destroyed.This is your task, .  Destroy them, our former brothers and sisters though they might be.26800We've been shipping in dead bodies from Silverpine, Hillsbrad... hell, anywhere we can get them from.  We can't, however, afford to ignore the bodies which are sitting right on our front doorstep.The last vestiges of the Scarlet Crusade roam here in Tirisfal Glades.  While we've managed to push them from Deathknell, several of their bodies litter the buildings to the north and the east.Go find them... and bring that Darnell fellow with you.  He looks strong enough to carry a few corpses.26801If you're going to be an asset to the Forsaken, you need to learn how to fight.  And there's no better target than the Scourge minions that continue to pester us.The wretched ghouls and Rattlecage skeletons that roam the north and to the east are former troopers of the fallen Scourge.  They should prove to be an even match for a fledgling  like you.Do not tarry - when you are done, speak to me again.26802First of all, look at your armor.  You're a mess, .If you'd like to stay in one piece--and I've no doubt you do--perhaps I can help.  If you can gather some paws and wings from the wolves and bats nearby, maybe I'll find some armor for you.  You'll find the creatures to the north and to the west of here.26803Garrosh is brash and speaks harshly, but his intentions are good. In time, he will grow to see your people as a valuable ally.I am awaiting reports about recent Alliance activity in Durotar, but they haven't arrived yet. Would you be willing to visit Razor Hill and ask him for the reports in person? The easiest way to get there is by wind rider. Doras, Orgrimmar's wind rider master will let you use one of his wind riders for a small fee. Look for him on the rise north of the Valley of Strength.26804When you're ready to take the wind rider down to Razor Hill, simply speak with me again. When you get there, waste no time in finding Gar'Thok. He's the one responsible for preparing reports on recent Alliance activity in Durotar.26805The Explorers' League is growing, .  Not only have they taken in worgen like me, but they have expanded their range in search of artifacts.  One of our best, Bronwyn Hewstrike, has set up a camp in the south, where he believes an item of titan origin may be hidden.Bronwyn asked me to perform some duties here in the north, one of which was to identify potential recruits.  You seem to be made of the right stuff.  Talk to Robert Rhodes, the flight master, and he'll send you down there.  Bronwyn's treat.26806Eitrigg will have to be happy with the part of the report that I've finished. Tell him to expect more in the future.This should cover the most important details of the increase in Alliance forces working out of Northwatch. Please apologize to Eitrigg for me and let him know that we've had our hands full here, trying to keep Razor Hill secure and supplied. When you're ready to return to Orgrimmar, simply speak to Burok and hire a wind rider.26807Since you've already spoken to Doras, you'll be able to hire a wind rider to take you right back to Orgrimmar. Each time you arrive in a new town, be sure to speak with the town's flight master. After that, you'll be able to use the flight master's services to travel quickly.Speak to me again when you're ready to purchase a return flight to Orgrimmar. Bring those reports to Eitrigg in the Valley of Strength once you've landed.26808You know, there's a troll hiding behind that pile of boxes.  She must be awfully sad, if she doesn't want to come out and talk to anyone.Here, give these to her.  They're very soft, and that maybe they will make her feel a little more comfortable back there.26809Zanzil the Outcast, an exile from the Gurubashi tribe, is my quarry.  Recently, I have heard tales from my brothers in the north about his planned reentry into society, starting with the emissary he sent to the Skullsplitters.  This is not good news.I want you to peer into Zanzil's current plans.  Take this incense, and place it in front of the bat totem in the Ruins of Jubuwal, to the north.  Hir'eek will guide you from there.26810You are to kill Zanzil.  You rode on Hir'eek's wings and saw through Hir'eek's eyes; you know where Zanzil hides within the Ruins of Aboraz.  Travel there and kill him.Oh, and : if we become separated, you should use this fetish.  It only works within Stranglethorn, but it will transport you back here to me should you need to return switfly.Good luck, .  Zanzil is no ordinary opponent.26811It looks like Zanzil's portal into Zul'Gurub is still open.  Zul'Gurub is a dangerous place, but Maywiki entrusted this task to you.The portal lies in wait in front of you.26812Ahead of you looms a ramp up to one of the city's many terraces.  The bat-shaped totems ahead of you indicate that this is the domain of High Priestess Jeklik, a follower of Hir'eek.Jeklik was one of the Hakkar-worshipping priests that Zanzil was planning to resurrect.  Perhaps if you hurry, you can stop the resurrection!26813Zanzil the Outcast has once again escaped through one of his portals.  Follow him!26814Venoxis was the second of the two priests that Zanzil planned to bring back from the dead.  You have already succeeded in destroying the body of High Priestess Jeklik... Venoxis must be the next.26815Years ago, the Gurubashi exiled one of their own from Zul'Gurub: a troll by the name of Zanzil.  The reasons why aren't all that clear, but I'd guess it had something to do with his tendency to administer powerful, behavior-altering drugs to anyone he saw.  Anyhow, the Gurubashi priests and their blood god have been slain, but Zanzil the Outcast remains......as do his powerful, behavior-altering drugs.I need his mixture for my next test.  Check the zombies to the north.26816Did you see that explosion I made?  I must have flown 10 inches off the ground!I've just got to get Zanzil's recipe so I can find out why it did that.  One of Zanzil's flunkies at the Ruins of Aboraz must have it on him.  Head east, to the coast of the Cape, and snatch it for me!26817This humour won't serve on its own.  Too thick.  WAY too thick.The nagas to our west maintain a shrine that dispenses the only clean water this side of Duskwood.  For most potions, I'll use river water, but Bronwyn demands accuracy!Obtain it from the Nek'mani Wellspring at the peak of the naga camp.  Good luck!26818Hi, I'm the town merchant!  And Bronwyn's my dad!Sorry, I shouldn't get too excited.  Father says it's not professional.Anyhow, people always come to me asking for heavy leather, or rough hides, but I think they might also like it if I had some soft materials... like tiger fur!  Think you could get some for me?You'll find a few panthers nearby, but if you want to see the big tigers, you'll have to go northwest from here... north of that big troll arena.26819The naga explorers to our west carry a valuable ocean reed - Akiris reeds.  Traders use them to make medicines and poultices, and craftsmen use them to line armor or even wrap cigars!In the evenings, when digging's done, father's been teaching me how to use them... but unfortunately, we ran out.  Would you mind getting us some more?26820Father says that a responsible merchant is always keeping an eye out for good deals.  I've been trying to look for deals everywhere I go, and I think I've just found one!The naga to the west have dozens of statues that they place on the ground where they live.  They couldn't possibly need all of them... so I was thinking that we'd take some for ourselves!Free statues!  That's a good deal, right?26821Well, we have no idea what this artifact is.  It's old, older than dirt... but not titan.  I'm completely dumbstruck.Airwyn Bantamflax in Booty Bay is my direct superior.  Our next step should be to inform her of this find.  Please, would you bring it to her?26822Ahem!  Hrm, hrm...You're lookin' fer somethin' ta do?  And ya come askin' ME?  Lowly ol' Goris?!Well, ah... this is a first.  Ah, I've got it!The vale ta tha north is filled with a bunch o' useless, belly-scrapin' basilisks.  They don't do nothin' for no one, and I hear they turned a guy ta stone once.If ya kill 'em, I'll give ya some o' my stuff.26823Whatever it is you want to do: I've got a recipe that'll do exactly that.  You want an exploding potion?  BOOM!!  You want a lightning potion?  ZAP!!  You want a shrinking potion?  Smeerp.So Bronwyn says he wants a carbon-dating potion?  Easy.  I could make that in my sleep.  The thing is... if we want it to be accurate, I need you to get some quality ingredients.Start with some humour from a basilisk to the north.  It'll need to be a pretty big basilisk...26824I did all I could, .  I had the right potions... I had the right recipes... but the source of this sample eludes me.  It's tens of thousands of years old, but we've shown that it's not of titan origin.  And it's not saronite, I can tell you just by looking at it.  So... what in Brann's name is it?Tell Bronwyn that I tried my best.  Sorry.26825Hey - you must be that  that Wulfred was talkin' about!  The one who found the ogre artifact, and helped him test out those strange stones from up north.  Welcome to the digsite, !We were actually working on identifying those samples right as you got here.  Would you mind bringing the sample over to Dask?  I need him to help me find out how old it is.26826Hey - you must be that  that Wulfred was talkin' about!  Welcome to the digsite, .We were actually just starting a project when you arrived.

Norsala, Lorvarius, and I will be meetin' them at Lorthuna's Gate.26828Sadly, I must stay and hold the rift, so you will have to battle without me. Go now to Therazane and join the battle, as promised. You should find her at the Halcyon Egress, north of Lorthuna's Gate and east of the Scoured Reach.When our part of the bargain is fulfilled, bring the last piece of the World Pillar here as quickly as possible.26829My forces have already begun the assault. Join them. Spill the blood of these cultists upon the ground, that I might feel how they suffer.26830I haven't given up my search for the Twilight's Hammer agents that lurk here in Orgrimmar. I need someone I can trust to collect the final evidence of treachery.Sauranok the Mystic - my own most trusted advisor! - is under suspicion. Uncover the truth, , and you'll be rewarded.I understand Twilight's Hammer has infiltrated workers at the airship docks, to spread their lies all over the continent. Question them. If you discover Sauranok's guilt... Kill him.26831Terrath wants you to make your way to the far end of the precipice to fight Zoltrik Drakebane. He is on his way there as well, but he thinks Zoltrik is likely to take to the sky.Quite an impression you seem to have made, little one. Have you ever mused that none of this would have happened if I had just stepped on you during our first meeting? Fate is a strange thing.26832There are two leaders among the Twilight that need to be killed.One is a human by the name of Boldrich. Small, as you are. But still dangerous, as you also are.The other is a priestess by the name of Lorthuna. She is wily and hard to corner. Strike swiftly and do not let her escape, or I promise you, you will regret it later.26833You have done as I've asked of you, . I shall honor my word. Gorsik will meet you at the temple with our piece of the World Pillar.Finish your ritual and bind the rift. After you have done such, tell your Earthen Ring to leave this place.You however... you can stay for a time if you want. You've earned at least that.26834Down below in Needlerock Chasm is where the mystics are sprouting all of these fungal monstrosities. I sent Slate Quicksand and a small force to deal with it, but they've run into a snag.You remember the Arch Geomancer? Would you fly down there to the northeast and lend him a hand?26835While you were out there, Pyrium Lodestone contacted me. He said that there is a matter of great urgency and that your assistance is needed immediately. Return to him at the entrance to Needlerock Slag to the southwest.I wish you luck with the rescue of the Stonefather and the recovery of the middle fragment.26836We found out where the Stonefather is being held and young Flint ran off on his own to rescue him!I don't have to tell you that this is bad. Flint is going to get himself captured as well, or worse!The stone trogg chieftain, Bouldergut, is at the end of the ledges above Needlerock Chasm to the north.Please, , you must go after Flint and free the Stonefather before we lose them both!26837Say, ... you seem suitable.Bronwyn Hewstrike of the Explorers' League has been asking for recruits at his digsite in the Cape of Stranglethorn.  Personally, I don't understand why he can't just go down to Booty Bay and find his recruits there... pirates are easily swayed by a couple pieces of gold.Either way... rumors are he's finally found something in that jungle.  I wonder what it is?26838Several years ago, Stormwind's Captain Kurzen brought a brigade into Stranglethorn Vale on a mission whose details are still murky.  Kurzen swiftly descended into madness, as did his men... except for a few rebels who made it their mission to undo the evils that Kurzen had wrought.As I said, that was years ago.  I'm now hearing rumors that Kurzen is dead, but those rebels still persist at their rebellion.  If you wish to investigate, you'll find them at a camp on Stranglethorn's northern border.26839Say, , you look tired.  Carrying around that heavy wallet... er, I mean... heavy equipment... must be a strain on your poor  back.Sassy Hardwrench has recently established a premier five-star resort on the sparkling coast off the Cape of Stranglethorn.  Balloon tours, rowboating, day trips to Booty Bay... they've got it all.You should really go visit.  I can tell just by looking that you need a break after so many difficult, lucrative adventures.26840With Orgrimmar secure and our Dragonmaw allies behind us, we can turn our attention to the conquest of the Twilight Highlands and the utter destruction of Deathwing's forces there.I need the Horde's best on the front lines. That means you. And all your friends.The Highlands WILL be ours!Use the new portal you created to return to Dragonmaw Port. Report to Zaela to see where she needs you the most.26841This sigil was given to me by a messenger from our mage trainer, Rhyanda. It seems Rhyanda would have words with you when you have a moment. Read it and bring it to her afterwards.26842Well met, . We've got a problem, and I'd ask you to lend a hand.It's gnolls. There's a mess of the things west of town, roaming the hills. Not usually any cause for alarm, but we've not usually had gnolls here in Loch Modan.I'm curious where they came from, but not curious enough to bother asking the mangy things. Clear 'em out, I say. Bring back proof of your kills and I'll pay a solid bounty.26843We've dealt with kobolds in these lands for years. Not much other than a nuisance. But they've been getting craftier at their stealing.I think one of them's ended up smarter than usual. Won't be that way for long, though!I want you to go to the camp south of here and make sure there's not a \"big shot\" kobold stirrin' up the other ones. Make sure to check the cave; it's a likely spot.And don't be shy about clearing out the other kobolds along the way.26844Now that those little blighters are dealt with, we've got more to take care of.The tunnel rats are swarming all over the Silver Stream Mine, setting up camps and sniffing around further and further every day. Greedy little things are looking for loot, I gather.Surveying and foraging is all fine and dandy when it's not on dwarven land! Take care of those tunnel rats and report back to me.26845Dorli's filled me in on this crazy trogg-slave operation the kobolds have going, and if you haven't talked to her about it yet, I suggest you do.I'd like to get to the bottom of this. Literally! Whoever's running this show is bound to be at the bottom of the mine, calling the shots, and I want them dealt with.Find whatever crafty bugger is directing the geomancers and diggers and bring me back their head.26846I've found out what those rats are up to. There's so many of them outside because they've got troggs digging for them in the mine!The tunnel rat geomancers figured out some kind of parlor trick to control the troggs, as creatures of the earth or somesuch.Fascinating, but not something we want to let them practice. Take out those geomancers right away.26854My friend and fellow Siege Engine pilot, Mori Hildelve, is lost in the hills. We were looking for a rare ore that's needed for a high-grade blastpowder, and during our search he drove his engine up a steep hill and busted it!Still convinced that ore was in these mountains, Hildelve charged me to guard our engines while he continued on foot.It's been days, and I've heard some beastly growls north of Helm's Bed Lake, west of the tunnel. Mori's tough as nails, but I'm worried.Please, . Find him.26855Hildelve wrote in his journal that he was attacked by Mangeclaw, a \"huge Ice Claw Bear.\"  He drove off the beast, but not before it mauled him savagely.Judging from the state of Hildelve's body, Mangeclaw must have later returned and killed him.However, Hildelve wrote in his journal his one, final wish:Revenge against Mangeclaw.26857If it's the dragon that's got the fragment, we're going to need to draw his attention back to his den.Go to Abyssion's Lair just east of here and defeat his underlings.  That should get him to show up with the World Pillar fragment sooner or later.26860There's never a shortage of empty bellies here in Thelsamar, kids running in and out, workers from the excavation coming in after a hard day's work. We're famous for our blood sausages, I don't suppose you've ever tried them?No? Well, around here you've got to work for your meals, and don't think just because you're a fancy , you'll be any exception.You get me some fresh bear rumps and leave the cooking to me!26861If we're to have a shot against Abyssion, we must make sure he receives no aid from reinforcements.You will find two gateways in his lair to the east.  Use this stormstone to disrupt their operation.If everything goes as planned, we'll be able to tackle Abyssion without him being able to receive much assistance.26863The Silver Stream Mine to the east ran dry long ago. It was converted by the Miners' League into a storage depot, but now kobolds have moved in, putting their filthy paws on good, dwarven tools!We'll root out those vermin soon enough, but the League wants someone to get their gear out of the mine before we warriors tromp in there and break things.  It'll be a tough delve - you might want cohorts at your side.The gear is stored in Miners' League Crates throughout the mine.  Good luck.26864I need you to take this back to Mountaineer Kadrell. Show it to him and tell him the nasty critters around here might be having some kind of get-together.26868Alright, now just shut yer gob and lemme talk, 'cause here's the plan.Those gnolls and murlocs are liable to be meetin' out there somewhere. So you take this clever plant disguise of mine, and you wear it and look like a plant. Then you sneak up on 'em, and you throw this scent pheromone you gathered on the mosshide standin' with the murlocs.Then the murlocs'll flip their spit, and the mosshides will think twice about trying to work with such crazy lil' buggers!26869Well done, .Within the tunnels below, you will find the stone which you seek. Painite.The dangers ahead are many...Dangers that the Stone Lords themselves fear.Remain steady.Remain strong.The strength of the rock itself is beneath your feet.26870Naralex had a noble goal.Our great leader aspired to enter the Emerald Dream and help regrow these harsh lands back into the lush forest it once was.But something went terribly wrong.Naralex's trusted allies, the Druids of the Fang, turned on him! They seek not to heal the Barrens, but to dominate it., before we can awaken Naralex and restore balance to this vital place, you need to eradicate the Fanglords. Their influence has sunk too deeply.26871You've done as I've asked.Turn back and escape the cave in one piece.Don't forget the gemstone.26872As Naralex descended deeper into his nightmare, a strange breed of beasts arose from beneath the Barrens into the Wailing Caverns.These deviate creatures have strange, otherworldly properties. Their very existence causes great pain to the earth. I believe that slaying them will greatly aid our work in healing the caverns.If you feel up to the task, slay as many as you can and bring me their hides as proof of their demise.26873There is an herb in these caverns that holds untold power, . Perhaps you wish to help me collect it?It is a rare flower called Serpentbloom. I believe that in greater quantities it has the potential to prevent nightmares like Naralex's from ever occuring.Unfortunately, Serpentbloom can only be found in the darkest recesses of this place.26875The Twilight Cultists are here! They're trying to stop the ritual! Get to the back chambers and help fight them off!26876It is time, .  We have spotted Abyssion making his way to the lair.The Twilight's Hammer might've thought the fragment would be safe if a dragon guarded it, but I've met enough dragons to know their one weakness.  Pride.Abyssion's not going to run from a fight with us puny mortals.Place the banner of the Earthen Ring in the middle of his lair.  Once we defeat him, bring the fragment to Maruut.  We need to to repair the World Pillar as soon as possible.26878, the Barrens used to be one of the most beautiful places in all of Kalimdor. It teemed with life and promise.Now, as you can see, that is no longer true. It is a land of great torment and strife.The Disciples of Naralex seek to cleanse the Wailing Caverns and bring them back to their former beauty. Speak with Nalpak just inside the Wailing Caverns to help.26881There's something sinister going on within this place, . We fear that the rumors of the Naga working with the Twilight's Hammer are true.I sent Thaelrid, one of our best scouts, further in to investigate the matter, but he hasn't returned.Seek him out. If he's still alive, find out all that he's learned.26882My strength has left me. I need your help!Long ago this site was a great temple of Elune. But misfortune led to ruin when the corruption of an Old God seeped up from below and tainted the sacred moonwell.Aku'Mai, a servant of the Old God, rose from the waters.The Twilight's Hammer cultists have allied with the naga to occupy these grounds. The cultists, led by Kelris, sacrifice innocents to Aku'Mai for power.Slay Kelris and bring his head to Ashelan.26883Empowered by the ancient rites of the chaotic Old Gods, the members of the Twilight's Hammer strive to bring about the return of their dark patrons and spread death and terror across the world.We believe that the Twilight's Hammer has allied with the naga and are amassing here.Whatever evil plan brews in the depths of the old temple must be thwarted.Wage war on the Hammer and bring back proof of your deeds. Your efforts will be rewarded handsomely.26884Foolish blood elves toil with demonic magic. Have they not witnessed what happened with the naga and with the satyrs of Kalimdor?I fear that the blood elves will meet a similar deformation. Azeroth cannot afford to give birth to another vile race of monsters.I wish to study the brain stems of the satyr and naga so that I might deduce what fate the sin'dorei are headed toward. Try to avoid harming the stems while you kill them, I won't take anything but perfect specimens.26885It is my duty as a trainee to collect lore for my superiors. Old lore. Powerful lore. Lore that opens doorways, and lore that could awaken more of Those Who Sleep if it is mishandled.There are rumors of an old piece of lore, the Lorgalis Manuscript, at the bottom of the Pool of Ask'ar in a Pitted Iron Chest. It is the old dwelling of our long-dead ancestors. They held great knowledge before their city fell to ruin.Search for the manuscript, please. I'm not skilled enough to venture further!26886That nasty ship on the east side of the cove keeps firing its cannons at us. It's kinda funny seeing all the goblins get hit by cannonballs, but some of my gnome friends are being hit too!It'd be really, really nice if you could make your way past those cannons and onto the ship. There's a mean ol' taskmaster yelling at the other deckhands in there, and I'm sure if you beat him up or kill him, they'll stop shooting at us!26887I know we're here to make friends with the Steamwheedle goblins, but those awful Bilgewater goblins are so rude.Why, I just saw a bunch of them pulling gold fillings out of the teeth of the Southsea musketeers and strongarms. Do they think they can just take that for themselves?Obviously, the nice thing to do is kill those pirates ourselves, take their fillings, and then give some of them to the Steamwheedle as a thank-you gift! Head on down there and beat those goblins to the punch.26888In the darkest recesses of Blackfathom, a monster spawned by the Old Gods lurks. We know it only as Aku'mai.The Old Gods and their servants are incredibly dangerous to our world. Long ago, they ruled over Azeroth and I fear that they seek to do so again, or destroy it while trying., Aku'mai is a creature of untold nightmare. We simply cannot allow his continued existence. Destroy him.26889Well gosh, we've cleaned up quite a bit here!Listen, , I'm looking forward to finally vacating this killbox so I can get away from these goblins and drop the cheer-act. If you'd like to continue to advance the interests of Gnomeregan, and by extension the Alliance, in the area, head south to Bootlegger Outpost.Talk to Zeke Bootscuff there, and remember that any work for the Steamwheedle will help us shut the Bilgewater out of Tanaris for good.26890Within the beginning tunnels of Blackfathom Deeps, there are large sapphire clusters along the cave walls. We noticed that the naga started harvesting the crystals around the same time their weaponry greatly improved.The crystals seem to have great elemental power and, if used inappropriately, could make for a powerful component for my smithing.Will you help me, ? Blackfathom Deeps can be found along Zoram Strand to the north of our outpost.26891The Twilight's Hammer has moved into the Moonshrine Ruins here.  Their presence can only serve to coerce the elements into working against us., find the Twilight agents here, then find the ruin's fathom stone; it should be somewhere underwater, probably right underneath their own noses. In it is a fathom core - a device that when properly read it will relate a history of all elemental activity.  If I have it, the Earthen Ring and I can hopefully do something to stop them!26892The Naga and the Twilight's Hammer work together to undo all the progress we've made in this area. What's more, Je'neu tells me that he feels the presence of an Old God lingering far beneath us.If they wish to witness chaos, we will give them just that., cut down their strongest warriors, and we'll see how much they enjoy it.Search carefully, Blackfathom Deeps is full of underwater passages and side paths in the caves that may hide your targets.26894The naga mock us with their defiance. We will drive them and their allies out of this land for good.Travel north of here to Blackfathom Deeps and speak with Je'neu Sancrea. He's already made his way inside.Be wary of Zeya, by the way. She can be a bit...temperamental at times.26895Hey, friend, you interested in excitement? Adventure? Money?

If we can reverse the effects and produce an antidote, we may be able to save the Quilboar.26903At last, help has arrived!You have no clue how long I've been held prisoner here. I can't remember the last time I saw the outside of this place.You see, I am an entrepreneur. Always out for a copper, as they say.

The elements flock to them, surrounding them protectively.These are sites of great power, and the largest is just west of Hammerfall. Not a soul trespasses, but if you go there alone, you can hear whispers from the earth itself.I have not visited there in a long while... but our grunts have told me the whispers have started again.

I want you to go, get some more experience, then try the new abilities you learn on one of the training dummies south of the entrance to the abbey.26918As you continue in your journey as a Paladin, you'll become closer to the light, learning new abilities.Go, get more experience, and learn a new ability. Demonstrate it for me, and we will continue your training.26919One of your responsibilities as a priest is caring for the wounded. Another is to go out into the world and be more... proactive about defending them.As you do so, you'll grow in power and learn all sorts of new things.Why don't you go out, get more experience, and then return to demonstrate what you've learned?26920Hurry, ... there isn't time to waste.The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge.  Lady Sylvanas has sent one of her best death knights to lead the charge for her cause, but I'm sure he can use all the help he can get.  With Arthas dead, now is the perfect time for the Forsaken to take Andorhal.Speak with the bat handler, Timothy Cunningham, when you are ready, and he will put you on the first flight out there.26921Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal.  My old counterpart, Thassarian, leads the Alliance forces.  If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once.I know Thassarian well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first.  We will do the same.Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers.  The Alliance will have to wait to taste our wrath.26922Araj the Summoner is bolstering the Scourge defenses with simple skeletons... an army of weaklings that will overwhelm you before it overpowers you.  He has assembled animi within Andorhal's northern towers that spew these skeletons out at an alarming rate.  But I've got the solution!Their function is simple.  Throwing these grenades at a bone animus... or, for that matter, a mob of skeletons... will reduce them to splinters.26923You fools will never defeat the Scourge with those abominations running around.  Koltira blathers on about reducing their numbers, but the Scourge's best weapon here in Andorhal can be found in those lumbering brutes that are throwing my deathguards around like ragdolls.I won't have it.  , enter the battlefield and destroy those monsters.26924The Scholomance is one of the few Scourge holdouts remaining west of the Thondroril.  The headmaster of Scholomance, a cultist by the name of Darkmaster Gandling, has made an appearance on the battlefield.This will be his final mistake.You will find Gandling in a square near the southern end of town.  I want you to fight and weaken Gandling.  I will join you to help finish him off.26925With the animus destroyed, the next logical step is to take out Araj himself, and to take a shard of his phylactery.  You've probably already seen him, lurking at the fountain in the center of town.Take my grenades with you.  They won't do anything to Araj, but if he decides to summon any of those skeletons, you can use them to blow them away.  Again.26926The Forsaken are victorious, and our forces are still strong.  Military strategy dictates that we attack the Alliance now, while they are recovering and unaware.  I have other plans, however...We will wait.  We attack Thassarian and his troops when the time is right.  In the meantime, speak with Rhonda Molver and take a flight to the Bulwark, on the Plaguelands' western border.  High Executor Derrington will give you your next assignment.You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal.26927So we've got troggs working for kobolds, and kobolds working for gnolls. The gnolls must've moved in from the Wetlands.How do I know? Well, they brought friends, because what's left of the Loch is swarming with Bluegill murlocs that were never there before.Pests are pests, but this coordination is worrying. I need you to talk to Cannary Caskshot. She's one of the best hunters in these parts, and she'll know how to handle murlocs, if you can pull her away from her mug long enough.26928Murlocs workin' with gnolls? That's a laugh! Now, just killin' them won't get you anywhere. Too many of the buggers.But I've got a plan, usin' the old noggin, see. Those murlocs, they have this smell, they get that smell on stuff, and when another murloc smells it, they go all crazy! Makes great bait for 'em.Anyway, they've got little glands that have that smell in 'em. You go and get me a bunch of those.26929Now while you're runnin' around doin' whatever the heck it is that you do, would you mind helpin' me out a bit?See, I usually go out huntin' crocolisks down in the loch, but given certain circumstances, I'd rather sit here right now. Mighty polite of you not to give me grief over it, thanks!So seein' as how you're such a , why don't you bring me back some crocolisk jaws and I'll give you some mostly-clean money in return.26930Our victories are quickly piling up, .  The Scarlet Crusade, which has long persecuted the Forsaken, is on its last legs.  While they still hold their monastery here in Tirisfal, they no longer occupy Hearthglen, or Tyr's Hand, far to the east.As recently as last week, there have been reports of Scarlet Crusade activity at a small camp east of Felstone Field, but I have reason to believe that they too have been eliminated.  Travel there, and verify this information for me.26931These Alliance forces walk around the Plaguelands like they own the place.  Well, they don't!  This land rightfully belongs to the Dark Lady!As the battle for Andorhal drew to a close, the Alliance forces occupying the Plaguelands scattered.  Several of them can be found just east of here, hunting foxes.  Prove to them that this is Forsaken territory.Kill the hunters.  Kill their hunting dogs.  And kill the foxes they hunt, for good measure.26932When the Stonewrought Dam burst, it drained near the entire loch. Horrible ecological devastation.And don't you go thinking it didn't really affect us dwarves! Not only are we plumb out of fish, but there's acres of dead threshadons out there left to rot in the sun. The buzzards are after them, and they're spreading all manner of filth and disease right on the outskirts of town.I can't ask you to clean it all up, but could you deal with the buzzards? Killin' even just a few will help.26933The men who till Felstone Field are no farmers.  They're soldiers.Thassarian's forces needed food, so he sent some of the Alliance north from Andorhal, to tend Felstone Field.  The battle for Andorhal may be over, but another battle looms... Forsaken versus human.  Killing those soldiers that work at Felstone will give the Dark Lady's forces a decided advantage.26934I need plagued grass for an... an experiment, of sorts.  Those Argent Crusaders and those infernal Cenarion druids have done too good a job of healing the plaguelands, however... and I can't find proper reagents within a reasonable walking distance.Some of the local wildlife retain the plague's touch, however.  Kill a diseased black bear, then retrieve the grass that grows where its decaying body lies.  It's not optimal, but it'll do.26935We are not the only Argent Crusaders here in the plaguelands.  Our headquarters, Hearthglen, lies to the north.  Even nearer to the north is a small lumber mill which we also control.Nathaniel Dumah is my main contact at the lumber mill.  I encourage you to speak with him, should you find yourself in that part of the woods.2693626937Derrington and his men don't know it, but it was I who ordered the plaguing of Felstone Field.  We need this area for practice.  If we're to win this war for Andorhal, we need to use our newest, most versatile weapon:Val'kyr.Take my enthralled val'kyr with you, , and kill the simpering Alliance scum that remain on Felstone.  Once they are dead, she will bring them back to this world... as one of us.The Forsaken shall not die out!26938A val'kyr's only purpose is to serve, and this one serves you.  I am now giving you full control over her abilities, .Roaming around the farm's outskirts, you should find several of the Forsaken that you just created.  I want you to use your val'kyr to gather at least five of them.  Once you have done so, take your newly-formed band of soldiers, bring them into Felstone's barn, and kill the beast inside.  Today, they will learn what it means to fight for the Dark Lady.26939How did you get in here?Oh, it doesn't matter. I'm Murd Doc of the G-Team. We're the best there is, and we're here to retake Gnomeregan!When nobody else could help him, the High Tinker found and hired us.But we simply can't do this alone! You're an honorary G-Team Commando now, .Take this parachute, jump down straight ahead into the Hall of Gears, and kill the Viscous Fallout. After you're done, report to Commando B.E Barechus by the west hallway. You two will get along great, I'm sure.26940We are the heirs to a legacy of arcane magic and your path will not be an easy one. Many still hold us responsible for the actions of our forebears, but our talents are needed.Though you must be cautious, it is important to develop your powers, as that will deepen your connection to the arcane and grant you access to new spells.Go - get more experience with your spells, and demonstrate what you learn for me.26941That Murd Doc is crazy, . Never, ever, let you find yourself in an aircraft with that gnome.Stealth usually isn't my thing, and it's certainly not going to be yours. Go down this hallway to the Launch Bay and dispose of the Electrocutioner 6000.The Electrocutioner is in charge of the aircraft......and I hate aircraft. I'm not getting in any sort of aircraft!Use this parachute to drop down afterwards and speak with Commando Face for your next job.26942I'd keep my distance from B.E Barechus and Murd Doc, neither is terribly stable.You are, though, so let's get you to work! Go down into this tunnel until you get to Tinkers' Court. Hopefully you'll know what to do when you meet Mekgineer Thermaplugg.Our leader, Commando Hann Ibal waits somewhere in there. He'll reward you handsomely for all your work.Probably.26943I used t' have quite the home back in Ironforge. That is, I did until I was booted out to make way for the gnomes.They couldn't stop a bunch of troggs with all them gizmos and machines! An' I have to pay for their weakness?No, sir. No longer.Go to Gnomeregan and talk to Commando Murd Doc. Sure, he's a gnome, but his crew, S.A.F.E. I think they call 'em, are going to take Gnomeregan back.Go! I want my house back!26944The gnomish capital, Gnomeregan, hasn't been under their control for some time now. I know what it feels like to lose a home.Please, venture inside Gnomeregan and speak to Commando Murd Doc, a member of S.A.F.E. If there's anything at all that you can do to help them take their home, I urge you to do so. There are dark secrets in those halls.26945As you overcome the challenges before you, you'll begin to learn new techniques.Go, get more experience, and learn a new skill. Then demonstrate it for me on one of the training dummies.26946I'm certain that by now, you've mastered using Sinister Strike against your enemies. But, as you learn more and advance as a rogue, you'll start to figure out new techniques. One you should figure out soon is called Eviscerate. It can be a strong way to end a combination of attacks.I want you to get some more experience, figure it out, then try it on a training dummy near the southeastern edge of Aldrassil.26947When most people think of the kaldorei, they conjure visions of druids and sentinels, but the way of the hunter is just as ancient and just as venerable.I've been observing you, and you've had quite a bit of experience handling that bow. As you gain more, you'll start to learn some new abilities.I want you to go out, get some more experience, and figure out how to do something new. Then go use it on a training dummy near the southeastern edge of Aldrassil.26948Druids play an important role in our society, but all too often we are seen as passive dreamers in a world that is changing around us.The truth is, though, we must actively practice and go out onto the world to develop our connection to nature.So go, get some more experience. You will begin to feel your connection deepen, learning new skills. Demonstrate the first you learn for me.26949As you venture out into the world and develop your skills, you will begin to learn new abilities that you never knew you had within you.I'd like you to go out, get some more experience, and then show me the first new ability you learn.26952I don't like the looks of what the Forsaken are doing here at the Bulwark.  Bombs, cauldrons, needless bloodshed... none of these embody that which the Argent Crusade stands for.  Furthermore, I don't like the fact that they employ mercenaries like yourself.Nothing against you personally, .  It's just that you could be doing so much more for yourself.  If you're interested in healing the plaguelands, rather than re-plaguing them, then report to Field Agent Kaartish at the Menders' Stead to the east.26953I am Adrine Towhide, a druid of the Cenarion Circle.  You can thank us for healing this land, where once there was only death.We accept all who choose to follow the druidic path, regardless of race, faction, or talent.  Occasionally that means we enlist a druid who needs more help than others.I'd like you to meet Zen'Kiki.  He's pretty new, and he's still learning his craft.  Would you mind taking him out with you for a while?  You can practice combat on the plagued animals that roam nearby.26954Among other things, Zen'Kiki needs to work on his spell accuracy.  I could see his wrath spells spiraling out of control even from here!  In fact, I used them as a marker to follow your progress through the woods.Perhaps we can use Zen'Kiki another way.  Take him up to the top of the hill just to our east.  The diseased hawks that circle above that hill must be destroyed.  Ask Zen'Kiki to shoot at these hawks.  Even if he can't hit them, he will distract them so you can finish them off.26955While you've been away, I've been trying a different approach on our friend Zen'Kiki.  I believe he may have a future as a healer.  This is mainly because healing spells never miss.I hear from Field Agent Kaartish that the cultist camp to the east is where the plagued animals are coming from.  I hope you don't mind escorting Zen'Kiki over there... perhaps he can help heal some of the plagued animals within the camp.26956!  I'm glad someone's here to help me out.We Cenarion druids have re-cultivated Dalson's Farm, immediately behind me.  The land has flourished and our crops have been successful... mostly.A few plants seem to still be infected by the plague that ran through this land.  Perhaps their roots were too deep, perhaps the seeds were weak... I cannot say.  All I can say is that I need an able  like you to help me remove the bad plants from the good ones.26957I've been many places in my life, good .  I fought the battle for Ahn'Qiraj, passed through the Dark Portal into Outland, and joined the Argent Crusade to beat down Scourge in coldest Northrend.But before it all, I was a farmer here in Lordaeron.  Now I find myself here in Hearthglen, a scant few miles from home.  It's time I paid my respects.I'm headed to the Menders' Stead before I return home.  I wouldn't mind meeting up with you again once I get there.26958Let's start your training right away. As you get more experience in combat, you'll start to develop new techniques.Go, get some more experience, learn something new, and demonstrate it on the dummies to the northwest.26960Great burdens have been placed on my son's shoulders in his short lifetime, and I fear his responsibilities are only going to grow.He will never learn leadership confined to the keep, but I am loath to send him forth without escort., your deeds in the wake of this cataclysm are already legendary. You would be an excellent mentor for young Prince Anduin.Please, introduce yourself to him. There is some pressing city business that you both can attend to for me.26961Recently, just before the troggs surfaced within the site, we had uncovered a large number of strange, carved idols. But we didn't have the chance to study them, for soon after their discovery the troggs chased us away from the ruins! And those idols have a strange effect on the troggs. It makes them go berserk!Bring me 8 idols - I want to study them, and I want them out of trogg hands!  You can find the idols on the troggs infesting the site.26963Let's start your training right away. It's going to be a struggle to survive here, and you'll play an important role in making sure our people are safe and well-supplied.As you become more experiened, you'll begin to discover new abilities. Go ahead and go out, learn something new, and try it out. Return to me when you think you've mastered it.26964All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Grand Executor Mortuus at Forsaken High Command in Silverpine Forest.Now, more than ever, your help is needed in routing the enemy infestation of the region and conquering the port of Gilneas!To reach Forsaken High Command you must travel south through Tirisfal Glades and enter Silverpine Forest. From there, follow the road south until you reach Forsaken High Command.Onward, ! Destiny calls!26965You're just in time, nub. It is nub, right?Yes, that's what the paperwork says: \"nub.\"Where was I? Oh yes, you're just in time! The Warchief should be arriving at any moment to meet with our leader and savior, the Dark Lady herself. Just stand by and be at your best behavior. I expect that when this demonstration is over we will all receive commendations!26966As a paladin, you're no stranger to the Light that touches all of us. But you also have the unique power to call upon the Light to help you in battle.As you gain more experience, you'll grow even closer to the Light and be able to call upon new powers in battle.Go, grow in experience until you have learned a new power, and then demonstrate it for me.26968In your future as a mage, you'll want to master a wide variety of spells. To do so, you need to deepen your connection by the arcane by growing in power.Go, get more experience as a mage, and demonstrate what you learn for me.26969Your walk with the elemental powers will take you to many places. As you grow in power, you will begin to learn new abilities. Let us start your journey with a simple, but useful, lesson.Learn the secret of Primal Strike, and then practice your new skill using the training dummies to the northwest of the Crash Site. Return to me when you are finished.26970As a priest, one of your most important duties is to use the Light's power to aid the wounded.Another is to use your power offensively, to protect them.As you grow more experienced, you will begin to uncover new abilities that you can use in your charge. Go, gain more experience, and then demonstrate the abilities you have learned to me.26971A noise in the main chamber of the temple draws your attention. You hear a familiar laugh... Lorthuna. She's returned to interrupt the ritual - you must stop her!26975I am amassing a warfleet to assault Twilight Highlands and bring an end to Deathwing's lackeys. My soldiers are ready but fleet preparations lag behind.My men at the docks need some inspiration and motivation. A visit from the Prince here should lift their spirits and remind them of the bright future they're fighting for.Take Prince Anduin to the docks with you and speak with Supply Sergeant Graves. I want Anduin to observe how a natural leader handles the situation.26977The city is still reeling from the seditious acts of the Twilight's Hammer in recent months. They prey on peasant fears and corrupt our most important citizens. We need to find out how deep the conspiracy runs.I've tasked Major Samuelson of the Stormwind City Guard to head up an investigation. He's right here in the throne room. See if you can assist his efforts.26978Have you seen the condition of Felstone Field?  The Alliance forces at Andorhal have taken the area, and they're using it to... to... to grow CROPS!I almost liked it better when the Scourge held the area.  At least they had the sense to put a giant plague cauldron in the middle of the field.We're going to take that farm back from these humans, .  Take these drums and place them at key locations around the field.  I'll be waiting here at the Bulwark.26979Now that Felstone is ours, we can use its acreage - and any dead bodies we find - for our own purposes.  I've received orders from higher up that you are going to be helping out in this process.You may have met Lindsay Ravensun on the battlefield in Andorhal.  I've never met her before, but she seems to have made some friends in high places, because she's taking over operations at Felstone.  You're to meet her at the charred Scarlet camp... the one you scouted out earlier.26980You've done good work here, . Askin' you to haul sandbags would be a waste, to be honest; I'd rather send you along where your skills are needed.We've got a small outpost up north in the marsh. Swiftgear's the gnome that built it, but you'll want to talk to Shilah Slabchisel and help her with Ironforge matters.I'll admit, she's a looker... but I wouldn't make the mistake of getting fresh with her! They don't call their family Slabchisel for nothing.26981Prospector Whelgar's been leading an excavation in the mountains southeast of here for quite some time. He had some raptor problems back in the day, but things were going better recently.Just the other day, we got word he had to evacuate the entire digsite again. I'm not sure what's going on there, but I can't imagine the cataclysm making a quarry any safer than it was before.There's good dwarves working there, . Would you go see what's wrong there, and maybe lend a hand?26989The battle over this region still rages, nub. Although we soundly beat back the Gilnean defenses and took Gilneas for the Horde, a small group of rebels managed to escape. The \"Gilneas Liberation Front\" - as they call themselves - make attacks of opportunity against our forces in the field. The rebels have had a few minor victories and now grow brazen in their assaults! The time to strike back is now, nub.Venture south into the wilds of Silverpine and kill any rebel that you cross.26992You have no doubt heard about the incident that transpired at the Wrath Gate in Northrend, yes? Due to those unfortunate events we are strictly forbidden from using the strain of life-shattering blight that we finally perfected. Now we have rules and regulations and other nonsense!They've given us some neutered version of the perfected blight and expect us to weaponize it.If I'm to get this crap functional I'll need several bags full of ferocious doomweed. You'll find it all over Silverpine.26995If we're to get this new blight up and running we'll need clean beast guts. The problem is that clean beast guts are a rare commodity in Silverpine Forest. Most of the beasts here have succumbed to disease and thus only have diseased organs.Do a sweep of the forested area east of here for worgs and grizzled bears. Kill only the non-diseased variety and rip out their entrails. Bring me all of the clean guts that you can stuff into your backpack!26997My investigations reveal, ah, it's likely that there's trouble brewing among the Stormwind dock workers. Shifty lot. Don't trust 'em.You should go there and shake the place down. Start grilling those longshoremen. That should keep you busy.Go rout out those Twilight infidels!26998The concoction is finally ready, but before I can put my seal of approval on this strain, we'll need to run a field test.Speak to Bat Handler Maggotbreath, here at High Command, and requisition a bat. The bat will take you to the Dawning Isles, east of here across Lordamere Lake, right into the heart of depravity itself - the Vile Fin murloc dens!Use the concoction against the murlocs and report the results back to me.Those results being that you killed them all, as commanded!26999No longer does the Scourge hold this area.  We, the living, are retaking Lordaeron.We have taken great strides already, as you have already seen.  The earth flowers, the trees grow tall and green, and the wildlife is beginning to return.  Yet a few remnants of undeath remain.While the trees and grass prosper, the animals are struggling.  Something is preventing them from healing, and I intend to find out what.  Bring me samples from the plagued wildlife so that I may study them more closely.27000Ah, it's good to be back in Northridge!  I've got my mill, my beautiful wife, a bouncing baby boy... I've even put in my hat with the Argent Crusade.  We'll be supplying Tirion's forces with lumber.My lumberjacks were being exceptionally productive, too... up until the point when the spiders came.  Now they refuse to go any deeper in the woods.Maybe you can help me out.  Hop on one of my horses and use it to frighten those spiders.  Maybe we can avoid bloodshed and just scare them away.27001The Highlord was generous enough to send some of his recruits to protect us here at the mill.  With your horsemanship skills, and their martial prowess, we can do away with this spider problem easily.Hop back on that mustang and scare those spiders again, but this time, scare them all the way up here to the mill.  These Hearthglen recruits can handle things from there.27002Oh, before you go, ... I have a message for you.  There's someone in Hearthglen who'd like to meet with you.  Said he's \"heard your name pop up\" a few times already.Consider yourself lucky, .  Not everybody gets a personal audience with Highlord Tirion Fordring.Oh, and feel free to use one of my mustangs for the ride up there.  They're the fastest money can buy.27003Well, hello there!Whatever brought you, I'm so glad that you're here! My friends will never admit to it, but we could really use a hand.The ancient region of Uldum has been exposed! Treasures beyond your wildest dreams, free for the taking!We just need a bit of an escort, what with the bandits and all...You'll accompany us, won't you?You're welcome to all the loot you can haul off!27004We came here to investigate rumors of a Titan artifact up at the Masters' Gate to the southwest.One of those Twilight's Hammer cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there. You're going to have to get them for us, .Keep searching the cultists until you find them.27005We came here to investigate rumors of a Titan artifact up at the Masters' Gate to the southwest.One of those Twilight's Hammer cultists must have the plans for what they're doing up there.

Why don' ya take yer flyin' beastie up there ta the southwest and see what all the fuss is about?27007Excellent work, .  We know exactly where the meeting location is.The Upper Silvermarsh is a mercury swamp to the east of here.  It's normally only inhabited by elementals and occasional stone troggs, but our scouts have seen some Twilight activity in the region.Make your way there and let's find a way to eavesdrop on the Forgemaster's meeting.27008I'm quite adept at riding my flying carpet. Unfortunately, when I tried to investigate what the cultists had uncovered up at the Masters' Gate, they nearly shot me down.You look as if you might be skilled with the flying reins as well. Would you mind flying up there to the southwest to see what they've unearthed?27009Amnennar the Coldbringer rules over the Razorfen Downs with very dark and powerful Scourge magic. I have managed to clear an opening in the thorns just above his seat of power, but his sorcery prevents me from launching an assault.If you venture up the Spiral of Thorns and engage him, he will be distracted long enough for me to attack him briefly, weakening him before he can use his most deadly spells. Once he is weakened, destroy him without mercy.27010The troggs in Deepholm have proven to be every bit as hostile as the ones in Azeroth.  Yet perhaps their presence will prove useful to our efforts.The crates they use for trawling through the mercury will conceal you perfectly if you submerge yourself beneath the marsh.Use it to approach the Twilight's Hammer camp in the eastern end of the Upper Silvermarsh undetected.27011Farther to the south, you will find Redpine gnolls... a new arrival to the area.  You probably passed some on your way here.  Nathaniel pretends like they're not a problem, but I know better.I've seen them running away with our lumber at night.  I don't know what they'd do with lumber - they don't seem particularly handy - but that doesn't stop them from stealing it.  Head down to their camps and steal that lumber back.27012I have my doubts about those gnolls' intentions.  They haven't attacked us yet, but their numbers are growing, and they seem to always have their weapons ready.  I'm no military expert, but that seems a little aggressive to me.Maybe if we took away some of their weapons, they'd be a little less likely to pose a threat to our mill.  I'd feel much better about the whole situation if you went down there and brought some of their weapons back to me.27013I'm happy for Nathaniel: he's spent so long trying to return to Northridge, and now with the Scarlet Crusade out of the way, he can finally move back home.  It's just... even for such a seemingly-idyllic setting, it's not really the best place to raise a family.For example: along this valley's edge, you will find rabid foxes searching for innocent prey.

Amateurs need not apply!Why, I bet you've never even hunted such an exotic beast. I'll bet silver any day that you can't match my record of ten boars killed. Try the ones on the eastern shore of the loch... but don't hurt yourself now, rookie!27017It's funny the things you remember.  I spent 16 hours a day working the fields, and every seventh day I'd head into bustling Andorhal to sell what I'd grown.  It was a tough life, but we did alright.But I barely remember any of that.  When I think back to those days, I think about Gloria's smile, or Andrea waving from the window whenever I'd look up from the plow.The farm's just a bit to the east, but I'm not sure I'm ready to go back, .  I'd just like to make sure I hold on to these memories.27019Outstanding!  My name is Belnistrasz, and I thank you for rescuing me.  I had given myself up for dead... or worse, as a meal for these Scourge-infested vermin.Listen... rather than just flee, I want to make a difference for all of our sakes.  Would you be up to helping me out to that end?  It's probably dangerous, but somebody needs to do it and I seriously doubt other adventurers will wander into this desolate place.27020You have done well.

Stabthistle seeds are responsible for up to 89% of seed-related injuries among hunters.You'll find stabthistle seeds mostly in the lower woodland just north of the lodge.

Daryl may like his boars, but the rest of us prefer things more exotic.Now, I'd never say the Loch draining was a good thing, but it did have a silver lining. The swampy ground's brought in new prey: Hornets!Giant hornets, mind you. Not many hunters have tussled with massive bugs before.

Bring me an ample amount, and we may be able to stop the Scourge's growth for good.27030We've seen more foxes in the hills lately. Cunning creatures, they are.

Daryl does have some skill, it pains me to say.A year ago, a large bear had been the target of the Farstrider Lodge, but none of the hunters had any luck with him. So, Daryl thought he'd try his hand against him.

Find her, slay her, and find out who she's taking orders from.27055The Cult orders state that the plague from the cauldron at Gahrron's Withering is in fact being used for TWO purposes.  The first is the practice of spreading disease through the animals of the plaguelands, which you already knew about.The remainder of the plague is being shipped to the Weeping Cave, a cavern north of Malicia's Outpost, for use in some dark experiments.  Students of the Scholomance are using this plague to re-animate the dead!Certainly they must be stopped.27056Deliver this report to Lady Sylvanas Windrunner.

You make the Forsaken proud, which is more than I can say for our general, Koltira Deathweaver.I intend to have a word with that death knight.  He has shamed himself and his cause.27151Greetings.  How do you do?  My name is Daria.I am one of the priests in charge of preserving the peace here in Hearthglen.  One of my duties involves maintaining the tower down the trail to the southeast of Hearthglen.  This particular tower is of personal importance to the Highlord.  It's the place where his son was killed.With the recent incursion of gnolls, however, maintenance of the tower has grown difficult.  Will you help me rid the trail of some of these gnoll vandals, so I can do my duty?27152Allow me to concentrate for a moment.Further down the trail, south of Taelan's Tower, the gnolls have carved out a small meeting area to the east of the main road.  Something is happening there... I'm not certain what.  We should investigate.  I will look for anything out of the ordinary... you just protect yourself.27153See those reagents over there?  And these supplies right here?  Those belong to the Argent Crusade.Gnolls are known for thievery, but as far as I know, Hearthglen hasn't had any incursions since the Redpine came.  Very suspicious.I know a few helpful folks within Hearthglen: Morris Vant, Outfitter Mendelev, Bree Ironstock, and High Cleric Alphus.  All can be trusted, and are well-connected.  Question them, to find out if they know anything about these lost supplies.27154Magus Bisp is one of Hearthglen's most preeminent arcanists.  To imagine that he would be interacting with gnolls... and dabbling in necromancy?  Unthinkable.You'll find him atop the tower near Hearthglen's main gate.  Hopefully he'll have an explanation for all of this.  If not, well... I wouldn't go to the top of that tower unprepared, .27155So... you killed a member of the Argent Crusade, inside of Hearthglen.  Usually that's not smiled upon, even in self-defense.I recommend you come back to Mardenholde Keep, and turn yourself in to Highlord Fordring.  Hopefully he will hear you out, and will be sympathetic with your situation.  I hope I haven't gotten you in any trouble.27156Finally!  You're here!  Get to work!My men have been sparring with these wooden practice dummies for far too long.  Sure, you can learn how to swing a sword by practicing with a dummy, but real combat requires a real combatant.Hmmm... I had asked for them to send me someone imposing, but I suppose a skinny-armed   will have to do.Now get in there and teach my men how to fight!27157Say, I never caught your name.  ?  Pleased to meet you, .I've got one more problem that needs fixing, and you have a look about you that just screams \"I'm a problem-fixer\".There's a small mine on the northern edge of Hearthglen, where we get most of the ore that the town needs.  My drudges who work the mine normally do a decent job.Unfortunately, it seems that a larger-than-average spider has taken up residence within this cave.  Think you can clear things up for me?27158Hurry, ... there isn't time to waste.The city of Andorhal is in the middle of a three-way war between the Forsaken, the Alliance, and the Scourge.  King Wrynn has rolled the dice and sent a death knight to lead the charge for his cause, but I'm sure he can use all the help he can get.  With Arthas dead, now is the time for the Alliance to start to retake Lordaeron.Speak with the gryphon master, Bibilfaz Featherwhistle, when you are ready, and he will put you on the first flight out there.27159Darkmaster Gandling of the Cult of the Damned leads the Scourge offensive here in Andorhal.  My old counterpart, Koltira, leads the Forsaken forces.  If we're to win Andorhal, we'll have to defeat both, but we will certainly fail if we take on both at once.I know Koltira well enough to know that he will focus on the Scourge first.  We will do the same.Take out the weaker, desiccated Scourge to reduce their numbers.  The Forsaken will have to wait to taste our wrath.27160Dried-up Scourge... weak.  Abominations... strong.We defeat strong abominations... we win war.27161Araj the Summoner is bolstering the Scourge defenses with simple skeletons... an army of weaklings that will overwhelm you before it overpowers you.  He has assembled animi within Andorhal's northern towers that spew these skeletons out at an alarming rate.  But I've got the solution!Their function is simple.  Throwing these grenades at a bone animus... or, for that matter, a mob of skeletons... will reduce them to splinters.27162The Scholomance is one of the few Scourge holdouts remaining west of the Thondroril.  The headmaster of Scholomance, a cultist by the name of Darkmaster Gandling, has made an appearance on the battlefield.This will be his final mistake.You will find Gandling in a square near the southern end of town.  I want you to fight and weaken Gandling.  I will join you to help finish him off.27163Gandling has brought his lieutenant, Rattlegore, with him.  This clattering horror is far more dangerous than any of the other Scourge you will find upon the battlefield... even the abominations.You will find Rattlegore within an old town-hall building, near the center of town.  I recommend caution before fighting him, .  He will not be a pushover.27164With the animus destroyed, the next logical step is to take out Araj himself, and to take a shard of his phylactery.  You've probably already seen him, lurking at the fountain in the center of town.Take my grenades with you.  They won't do anything to Araj, but if he decides to summon any of those skeletons, you can use them to blow them away.  Again.27165The Alliance are victorious, and our forces are still strong.  Military strategy dictates that we attack the Forsaken now, while they are recovering and unaware.  I made a deal, however...We will wait.  We attack Koltira and his troops when the time is right.  In the meantime, speak with Ginny Goodwin and take a flight to the Chillwind Camp, to our south.  Commander Ashlam Valorfist will give you your next assignment.You will hear from me when you are needed again in Andorhal.27166We must always be prepared for battle, .  Whether that battle is against the Forsaken in Andorhal, against the Scourge in the east, or against some yet-unknown foe is unknown.  What is known, is that we must be ready.We are low on arrows.  I can obtain the shafts and heads, but I still need feathers.  The birds that circle to the northwest typically molt this time of year.  Would you mind traveling out into the field and gathering some of these feathers for our camp?27167I hail from Westfall, far to the south... as do these men that travel with me.  We are farmers, and nothing more.I had been told that Lordaeron had been healed, and that it was ready for tilling.  However, this \"Commander\" now tells me that it's too dangerous to proceed.  He says that there's a war going on, and that the plaguelands still aren't healed.Before anything else, I need to get some food in my men's stomachs.  Anything will do.  Bear seems to be plentiful.27168Sorrow Hill, up the road to the northeast, was one of the first places that the Argent Crusaders and Cenarion Circle were able to heal.  The area is now freed of the Scourge.However, there are still many specters of the past that, for some reason, have not passed on into the next world.  They may be mourning, they may have unfinished business... or they may just be lost.Take my thurible and use it to douse them with holy incense.  One way or another, we will help them move onto the next plane.27169These farmers from the south wish to take these farms, but I can't let them enter the plaguelands unprepared.  Even with the Scourge gone, danger still looms in the form of the Forsaken.  No, we must be ready to fight... and that includes our new visitors.Before doing anything else, however, I would recommend that you travel to Uther's Tomb, to the east, and place this tribute before his statue to ask for his blessing.  Speak with the priest that tends to the tomb when you are finished.27170If you truly intend to move forward in this battle for Andorhal... well, perhaps I can help.To the east lies a large crypt.  The bottom level of the crypt was once used for storage of weapons and armor... until the Scourge came.  Now that the undead have left, the weapons are free for the taking.Most of the weapons are probably rusted and rotten by now, but they will serve better than tunics and pitchforks.27171As you turn around, you see the silhouettes of shambling skeletons on the stairs.The undead aren't gone from this crypt.  They were lying in wait!  Furthermore, they appear to be armed with the weapons that you came looking for.You'll have to escape from the crypt.  On your way out, you should gather as many pieces of equipment as you can.27172The farmers traveled to the Writhing Haunt, an old farm to the northeast, across the river.  Someone needs to keep an eye on them.Bring them those rusty weapons and armor you found.  We can't have them fighting with pitchforks.27173I told Commander Valorfist that we could hold our own, and we intend to.  I had a little conversation with the death knight general, Thassarian, on my way over here.  We farmers plan to help in our own way.We will take control of this farm, begin to cultivate the land... and then when the battle for Andorhal commences, we will attack the Forsaken from the rear.  They'll never expect it.First, we need to get rid of these Forsaken outriders.  Kill some, then return to me.27174In fact, you might still be able to help train some of my men.  You probably noticed the abomination outside.  We initially tried to fight him, but he didn't fight back.  He seems to want to help out on the farm.Take a group of four settlers and challenge this abomination to combat.  He seems to be pretty tough, but with one of him and five of you, I think you'll have a chance at beating him.27175These men and women here at Chillwind Camp have noble goals, but their ultimate purpose is war.  I would like to offer you an opportunity to pursue more peaceful goals.At the Menders' Stead, beyond war-torn Andorhal to the north, the Argent Crusade has joined forces with the Cenarion Circle.  Together, we work on healing this land from the plague that used to reign here.Are you interested in joining our cause, ?27176The etching around the surface of this object indicates that it is of ancient origins, and yet no signs of wear can be detected.A hole on its edge, full of splintered wood, assures you that it is meant to be mounted on a wooden pole of some sort.Before showing this find to Doctor Jones, you set off to find the missing staff.27177Between the Horde and the naga, our fleet has been decimated. We can't do anything to bring back the men who gave their lives to the sea, but sink me if I allow all of our supplies to be lost forever.Swim out to the Obsidian Breakers southwest of Highbank and retrieve our supplies from the wrecks and the ocean floor.27178They've come slithering up from the ocean depths, . The naga. I think their intent is to reinforce the Bastion of Twilight, probably by heading inland via the Verrall river. We can't let that happen!Teach them that these shores are ours now, and send them scurrying back to the lightless depths.Kill the Blackscale naga worming their way through the Obsidian Breakers!27179This unfortunate pygmy was in the wrong place at the wrong time.As you ponder his bad luck, you take notice of the symbols covering his shield - far too elaborate for pygmy scrawl.Confident that Doctor Jones will find such objects of interest, you set out to find more fragments like this one.27180A convoy of veteran troopers and Forsaken catapults were ambushed earlier today while attempting to cross Olsen's Farthing, directly south of here. It was a total loss: all troopers were killed and all catapults destroyed.Bloodfang's pack was responsible for the ambush, though likely they have all fled back into the hills, preparing their next cowardly strike. Their day will come, but for now I want you to go to Olsen's Farthing and honor our fallen.Recover their Forsaken insignias.27181It looks like a group of the ambushers stayed behind. Make them pay for their insolence! Kill all of the Bloodfang stalkers at Olsen's Farthing. For Sylvanas! For the Horde!27182The marsh seems to have a strange effect on humans. Some grow mad simply by living here.Anyone who has ever settled at Swamplight Manor has gone mad in a spectacular way. The latest owner, one \"Swamp Eye\" Jarl, is already showing signs.I don't completely understand what's happening there, you'd have my thanks for looking into it.The manor is at the eastern edge of the swamp. Trek east across Bluefen and past North Point Tower. The manor is in a haunted patch of land called Witch Hill.27183I like cooking.  Good swamp cooking.  Fried green frog legs and the like.And I'm all out of legs. The manor is overrun with frogs, though. Giant marsh frogs. Think you could bring me some of those legs? Nothin' to it, really. Just bop 'em on the head and bring me the legs.Then I'll make a stew and stew it up and suck it down and give you some too.Do you like stew?27184Eye juice is good juice for drinking.  Too bad most critters only have two eyes.But spiders have lots of eyes.  Lots and lots.  And Darkmist eye juice is tasty.  Smooth and salty!  Unpopped spider eyes... I taste them already.Darkmist spiders are west of here, in the Darkmist Cavern.  You figure the spiders are named after the cave... or is it the other way around?27185Look, I'm not about t' play games with ye. The Scarlet Crusade's Crimson Hammersmith was nothin' worth mentionin' before, but now that they're Balnazzar's Risen, the damned dreadlord has taught him t' make all sorts of powerful demonic weaponry.It's simple. Find their blacksmithing plans and kill the Risen Hammersmith when he comes for 'em, so that we can make sure their army doesn't get their hands on demon armaments. They're powerful enough as it is!27186I have cutting to do.  I can't tell you what I'm going to cut, but... I need myself a blade.  A certain blade...Some people call it a sword.  I call it a swing blade.You help me?  Those fish-men, you know, murlocs or whatever they're called.... There's one they call Razorspine, carries a big sword, lives north of here near the beach. That's the sword I need!But don't sleep on this.  What I'm cutting won't keep forever...27187Hyenas, on their best day, are a nuisance.These foul specimens have a particularly nasty disposition, are riddled with all manner of disease, and are simply a blight on the face of dogdom.Do the world a favor and rid the deserts of Uldum of this mangy menace.27188I traveled out here to pay Jarl a visit at his new home and it's been a nonstop horror show ever since! There's something seriously wrong here and I can't be the only one who sees it...Have you seen the ghosts and corpses shambling about Witch Hill? I've a feeling that if anyone knows what happened here, it is them. Seek out these risen husks and risen spirits in the surrounding area, grant them rest through combat, and see what you can learn from them before this evil consumes Jarl!27189In my years as an herbalist, I've often observed that nature will provide subtle cures to the most vexing of problems. I've read that hedge mages and witch doctors often use the smoke of an herb known as witchbane to draw evil from its hiding places.If true, this would mean witchbane should be growing near the shallow waters of Witch Hill. You should be able to identify it by its broad leaves and reddish central stalk. Bring me any of the herb you can find, . It may be our only hope.27190The torch is ready. Plant it at the end of the dock and be prepared to face whatever comes forth.I have no idea what the torch's smoke may reveal... if anything emerges at all. I must say, I have my doubts about this kind of folk magic, but we haven't time for anything else. For your sake and Jarl's, I wish you luck.27191You meet some people out here sometime. Nice people. Met an ogre once. Ogres get hungry just like me.I'll never forget what he said. He said \"Mud big ogre. Me hungry. Go bash fishy. Bring Mud food. You feed Mud or Mud eat you.\"So I got him those fish and he ate 'em up. That's when I started too. The heads are the best part, all soggy-like.Don't crush those heads now. It makes them sad. Sad heads aren't good eating. Get me happy heads and I'll eat them and be happy too.27192Men as far as Kul Tiras spoke of the legendary Fras Siabi's premium tobacco. It was a delicacy enjoyed by every single person of importance that visited Stratholme. King Terenas, Uther the Lightbringer, Highlord Fordring...yes, they all enjoyed Siabi's specialty.Sadly, Fras stayed in his shop when Stratholme was invaded, swearing on his life that the Scourge would never touch his tobacco. Venture forth and see if even one bit remains here...it is worth its weight in gold, I assure you.27193Search the nearby farmhouses for Alliance stragglers. Keep an eye out for any information that could lead us to Crowley and Bloodfang. Seek and destroy all that would stand in your way, !27194We must act quickly, . They mustn't be given the chance to flee. I am dispatching a squadron of my most powerful troopers to the Deep Elem Mine. I'm also sending the Horseman with them to ensure that nothing goes wrong.

Especially for someone who hasn't taken my courses.These tablets provide new information on several subjects.They indicate that these obelisks are part of an enormous ancient mechanism that once kept this whole region masked from the rest of the world.They also depict how to recharge the mechanism, which is where your Shaft of the Stars comes in...Get ready, . We have some history to make!27197Word is in from Andorhal, .  The battle has resumed.It has become somewhat well-known among the Alliance forces that you're a hero of the first battle of Andorhal.  Thassarian has requested your presence immediately.27198I'm no military expert, but this battle looks to be in our favor.  Our defenders are equally matched with their deathguards, but the farmers' militia has taken them by surprise from the rear.  For the Alliance!Still, we should all do what we can to make sure that we win.  Travel east into Andorhal and slay the Forsaken deathguards that are fighting with our men.  The sooner they die, the quicker we can re-take Andorhal!27199To the east, deep within Forsaken-held Andorhal, you will find their commanders.  They do not fight, but call out orders from horseback.Hunt down and slay these commanders, .  The Forsaken won't stand a chance.27200She's still out there... Ophelia, the Siren of the Highlands! Her terrible song will lure you to the depths. I've vowed to stay behind and avenge my fallen crewmates, . If you want to join me, just say the word.We'll lash ourselves to the mast, we will. We'll shut our eyes. We'll stuff our ears with wax. And when her beautiful illusion drops... we'll strike.Are you in?27201The val'kyr were one of the Scourge's primary weapons.  Not only were they skilled in battle, but they could be used to convert corpses into Scourge minions.  To think that Sylvanas is stooping to such levels for the sake of the Forsaken...We need to stop the val'kyr before they wipe us out and turn our army against us.  Slay as many as you can find.  And bring some of these minutemen with you.  If they've survived this long, then they must have some battle skill.27202Our militia has been nearly wiped out.  Only I and these few farmers remain.Those winged creatures... they took the bodies of our men and... and turned them into walking, undead corpses!  With every one of our men they took, they bolstered their own ranks.It pains me to admit it, but you will need to fight them too, along with the deathguards and val'kyr.  As they did in life, they hunt in packs, so take some of my minutemen with you.27203Thank the spirits you're here, .We're not sure how much longer we can maintain the rift in the Maelstrom.Our most powerful members, led by Thrall, are barely preventing the tear.Last I heard, our only hope was to go through the breach and attempt to stabilize it from the other side.I will conjure a portal.  Take it and report to Thrall as soon as you can.27204Our last hope of victory lies in defeating the val'kyr.  You've done well up until now... but you're only one  and there are literally dozens of them raining destruction on the battlefield.One enormous val'kyr sits atop the tower to our south... you can see her from here.  Perhaps if we eliminate her, the remaining val'kyr will dissipate.This is our only hope.  Bring some of Grant's men with you.  You'll need their protection for this battle.27205We nearly have this battle won, .  I can taste victory.  The Forsaken never stood a...What the hell is that!?27206Head south, to Chillwind Camp.  Tell Commander Ashlam Valorfist everything that happened here.Me?  I'm going west, into Tirisfal.My battle's not over yet.  I've got an appointment with that harpy that calls herself a Banshee Queen... and I'm finding out what she did to Koltira.27208With the fall of the Scarlet Crusade, their disguised demon leader, Balnazzar, released the possessed body of Grand Crusader Dathrohan and went on a rampage, killing every remaining crusader here. He then used his necromantic power to raise them all as vile undead slaves.Balnazzar refers to his new army as the Risen. We cannot let him grow this army - they are extremely powerful and, unlike Arthas' Scourge, Balnazzar will not hold his forces back. Kill him while we still have a chance, .27210It's good to meet you, . I've come to Theramore to help eliminate the problem of the deserters. Not only have some of the men abandoned their posts, but some have filtered back into the town.These deserter agents are spreading lies and propaganda, hoping to convince others to join their ranks.They're at virtually every guard post throughout the town and the docks. Find them, expose them, and discredit them. At this point, anything more risks inspiring more sympathy for them.27211The deserter agents were doing far more than just chatting up the guards. We've found a number of leaflets the deserters somehow managed to smuggle in on a ship in the docks.The ship used to transport the leaflets is still in Theramore, at the farthest dock. If you can sneak aboard and capture the rest of their propaganda documents, their agents will lose their most powerful tool. Be careful! The ship is manned by seasoned privateers and the cargo is probably being kept in the captain's quarters.27212I've altered the leaflets you captured from the deserters' mercenary friends at the docks. Now, anyone who reads them will get an entirely different view of the deserters and their aims.If we distribute these to enough of the guards, the deserters will be too embarrassed to ever reestablish their presence within our walls.Why don't you get started while I plan our next move?27213Now that we've eliminated the deserters from Theramore, it's time to complete this operation. My local contacts have reported that the deserters base their operations in a ship moored on a small island to the southeast of the docks.Arresting their leader, Gavis Greyshield, should cause the others to lose their will to fight. Find him within the ship and convince him to surrender. I wouldn't be surprised if he puts up a bit of a fight for show, but then surrenders when he understands he can't win.27214Reports from our scout patrols have recently taken a disturbing turn. They tell of men wearing red Defias bandanas walking the Dreadmurk Shore north of Theramore's walls.Wreckage in the area suggests they may be survivors of a shipwreck, but our information is limited. Captain Wymor at Sentry Point, a guard tower to the north of the city, is looking for help in following up on the reports.27215There's a fellow the locals know as \"Swamp Eye\" Jarl, who lives alone out in the swamp. Sometime ago he \"took over\" Swamplight Manor after the previous owners disappeared under mysterious circumstances.I like to send someone to check up on him every once in a while. He kind of reminds me of my grandfather, you know? Some say he's not quite right in the head.If you're headed northwest on the road out of Theramore, you'll find Swamplight Manor in the Witch Hill area, before the road turns west.27216The old lighthouse out to the east hasn't worked for some time, but Babs Fizzletorque has gotten it into her head to get it working again.I don't know how she plans to do it by herself, but she claims that it'll make the movement of ships and goods into the docks smoother, so I can't really object. Drawing duty on the docks is really nothing to complain about when you could be on the front lines, you know?27217The old log in the lighthouse indicates that the lamp was fueled with oil from the threshers that live along the coast here.I suppose it's a practical, if inelegant solution. The log says that the oil taken from the youngest murk threshers works the best, and those live right underneath the docks of Theramore.If you're up for it, would you help resupply the lighthouse with fuel?27218You know, it's amazing what you can find in that old lighthouse. After I lit the lamp, I noticed this book in one of the old trunks up there.\"Dastardly Denizens of the Deep!\"Why, I think I might swoon if I ever saw one of these! I'm sure it's good for a laugh or two, but I simply don't have time for reading right now.You know who might enjoy it, though... that fishmonger on the docks, \"Dirty\" Michael Crowe. He collects old books.27219Oh, I'm sure you and Babs had a good laugh over the outlandish descriptions and sketches in the book, but have you stopped to consider there might be some truth to the legends?If you listen closely enough, I bet you can still hear sailors talk about Tethyr, the sea creature the book says lives right here! Of course, if you wanted to know for sure, you could always ask old Nat Pagle.He's got a small fishing camp on a little island in Tidefury Cove, which is southwest across Dustwallow Bay.27220So you found a copy of Dastardly Denizens of the Deep, did you? Well, I can tell you from experience, it's all true. I've even seen a few of 'em with my own eyes.But you want to know about Tethyr.  I said I'd make you a deal, so here's what I want you to do. I'm working on a new line of baits, but I haven't tested this one yet.Just take this paste -- yeah, it smells a little foul -- smear it on yourself, and swim into the deep part of Tidefury Cove to the southwest. Let me know how it works!27221Yes, Tethyr is certainly real, and he lives in the waters off Theramore.Has a thing for bright lights. He's the reason they shut down the lighthouse in the first place, you know...And if you light it up again, he'll come right back. But no one in their right mind would do that.So that must be your plan! It's been good sharing a drink with you, but don't blame ol' Nat if Tethyr REALLY turns you into fish bait. If you're going to do this, make sure you consult Major Mills at the Theramore docks.27222Sea monster or no, we're not going to risk the safety of our shipping. I've ordered our best marksmen to prepare for a confrontation with this Tethyr. The artillerymen have augmented the dock's defenses with three mortars.I'm going to order the lighthouse's lamp illuminated. If Tethyr does attack, it will be your job to operate the mortars and take down the beast before it can kill all of the marksmen. I wouldn't stand in one place too long, though. Using the mortars is likely to draw its attention.27223Where Market Row meets Festival Lane, you will encounter The Unforgiven. If you slay the entirety of Crusaders' Square, you will coax out Timmy the Cruel. Both of these former champions committed heinous acts against innocents here in the name of gaining unholy power.You must destroy both of them and rid Stratholme of their foul presence. Take caution, for they were powerful fighters in life, and their new dark powers will only have made them even more deadly.27225Ander Germaine has sent word that he wishes to honor you for your mastery of arms and your dedication to the Alliance. Make your way to Stormwind, leave the Old Town district through the south exit, and speak with him in his Command Center. I do not know what he has planned, but it sounds like he has been impressed with your rapid progress.27226Thank the Warchief that you're here, . I've made a critical error with the sea dogs and need your help to rectify the situation.You see, I sent them out against the worgen coming from Fenris Isle stone cold sober. They attacked the beasts and promptly got their butts handed to them. Many of them died, but a few still live, barely clinging on to dear life.Take this barrel of ale to the Decrepit Fields, east of here, and force it down the throats of fallen sea dogs.27227This Chapel is the last Light amongst so much darkness. Ras Frostwhisper took his own life in the slaughterhouse, carving his face into a macabre smile in front of the Lich King, who raised him into the Lich that now haunts Scholomance.The ground where that atrocity occured is now Scourge holy ground, blessed by the Lich King with the very darkest magic. Lord Aurius Rivendare, new ruler of Stratholme, now guards it and continues his master's evil work. Slay him without pause.27228Deep within, you will find Ramstein the Gorger. I cannot bear to tell you the atrocities this monster has commited. Know only this - he deserves to feel the full wrath of countless lost souls, a wrath you will bring upon him.Have no mercy. Be unwavering in your fury.27229SPIDERS IN NORTH CAVE BAD. POISON OGRES. OGRES GET SICK. BAD!BIG BIG SPIDER IN CAVE MAKE MORE SPIDERS. MORE SPIDERS BAD!KILL BIG SPIDER, STOP MORE SPIDERS. KILL BIG SPIDER, GET BIG PRIZE! GOOD!27230The Scourge are adept at forging powerful armaments for their soldiers, making it difficult for our men to kill 'em! There are blacksmithing plans near the Baroness Anastari's ziggurat that their chief swordsmith plans to use for an extremely powerful weapon for Lord Aurius.We're going to prevent that weapon from being made and stop their regular arms flow with one blow! Go take the plans and kill the Black Guard Swordsmith when he comes to defend 'em, and it'll make our mission much easier.27231Those that survived your assault on Fenris managed to drink the blood of the wolf. They turned into ferocious worgen, hell-bent on vengeance. Now they paddle across Lordamere Lake and assault my sea dogs. Many have already been killed. The worgen monsters must be stopped!Make your way to the Decrepit Fields, east of here, and kill the Hillsbrad worgen that infest the area. Once you've killed them all, make your way to the Horde communication panel, located at the docks. I'll be in touch.27232Those worgen you killed were the scouting party. There are hundreds more incoming! Looks like Crowley and Bloodfang made the blood offering to every human in Lordaeron.Get in one of those Horde cannons and send them all back to their makers. Let the waters of Lordamere Lake run red with their blood!27233I can handle training from here.  If you're looking for something else to do, I recommend heading up the road to the northwest.  The Cenarion druids and Argent Crusade have a small camp set up there, at Dalson's old farm.  Maybe they can keep you busy until we need your help again.27234My scouts have reported a shipwreck just off the beach to the northeast. Shipwrecks aren't all that unusual out here, but the reports also indicated the survivors were all wearing red bandanas... the symbol of the Defias!The reports indicate their leader resides on a large island just off the coast to the northeast of the tower. Kill him and retrieve any documents you find in his possession.27235From the wording of the orders you recovered, it looks like the first priority of the Defias will be to locate and secure whatever cargo they possessed.SI:7 has had a salvage diver named Renn McGill working out of Theramore for some time. When he heard about the shipwreck, Renn went north to dive near the islands the Defias now occupy.If we're to beat the Defias to this cargo, we'll need his help. Look for him in the waters northeast of a small island just north of the island you visited earlier.27236There's plenty of wreckage strewn across the bottom of the water from here to Alcaz, and the Defias have already got divers out there looking around. With the help of some of their gear, we can get you suited up and ready to join the hunt, but you'll have to do some creative \"borrowing\" first.Search this island for a crate of diving gear and something to repair it with. When you've got them, bring them to me and I'll have your gear ready in no time!27237Well, I was able to make enough repairs to this gear to let you dive for awhile, anyway. I wouldn't count on it holding out for a long time, though.The wreckage of the ship is strewn along the bottom from the east coast of this island out toward Alcaz Island. While that helm holds out, locate pieces of the wreckage on the bottom between this island and Alcaz. Use this salvage kit to search the wreckage for pieces of the cargo. Be careful not to venture too close to Alcaz Island. Those hydra are fierce.27238You must bring news of our findings to Lady Jaina without delay! If the Defias were transporting a prisoner, there's no telling who it might be or if the person is still alive!One thing is for certain, . The Defias wouldn't go to all this trouble for some petty grudge. Their prisoner must have been someone of importance. Lady Jaina would know better than anyone else what these findings mean. You'll find her at the top of the mage tower at Theramore's center.27239It looks like Renn's hunch about Alcaz Island was right. We need to survey that island, but it would take a whole brigade of troops to fight our way in there.Theramore's defenses can't weather such a hit, so I've arranged with Cassa Crimsonwing, the apprentice to Theramore's gryphon master, to allow you to use one of her beasts to survey Alcaz from the air.Alcaz Island holds the key to the mystery of the Defias' involvement in this kidnapping.27240Although Onyxia has been exposed and removed from the court, the Defias who carried out her plan must be punished. Carry word to King Varian Wrynn in Stormwind castle that the Defias are the ones who carried out his kidnapping. I have little doubt that the king will mete out swift and terrible justice to those involved.I can use my magic to expedite your trip to Stormwind. Just speak to me when you're prepared to go, .27241I must make plans to destroy the remnants of the Defias. Please convey my thanks to Lady Jaina, back in Theramore. She has ever been a loyal friend and steadfast ally.Go to the Mage Quarter at the western end of the city and speak with Archmage Malin at the foot of the tower there. He will speed your return to Theramore.27242The patch of swamp to the northeast is home to a particularly nasty breed of raptors. We've lost more than one unwary soldier to them, but I think we can turn them against our Grimtotem neighbors.Take this rope and use it to capture Bloodfen raptors or Bloodfen screechers that you've subdued. I wouldn't try to capture one of the beasts until you've weakened them quite a bit in combat. It's going to be quite a struggle.27243Now that we've got our raptors, our next move is to \"encourage\" them to attack the Grimtotems at Blackhoof Village to the northwest.I've got a leftover haunch of... well, it doesn't really matter what it is. It'll be your bait. Set it down on the ground in Blackhoof Village near the windmill in the center of the settlement. The raptors should take care of the rest, if their training took.27244Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.The parchment is a report made by an orc who spent weeks spying on the city of Theramore.After scanning the parchment, it is clear that it must be brought to the orc spymaster in Brackenwall Village.27245We're doing all we can to keep the Grimtotem raiders at bay, but they keep launching assaults on the tower. Even worse, they've managed to discover and capture the patrols the captain sends out to gather information and safeguard the road.I suspect the captives are being held in Blackhoof Village, to the northwest. Knowing the Grimtotems, the defenders of the village probably carry the keys to the prisoners' cages with them. I don't care what you have to do, , just bring back my men alive.27246Sifting through the loose dirt, the severed hand of an orc is found.  And clutched in the hand is a bone-carved tube.  And in the tube is a dirt-stained parchment.The parchment is written in orcish... and it looks important.27247Captain Vimes should see the orc report you found, .  He knows the orcish language better than most.  And he should know that there are Horde spies near Theramore!The captain is in the barracks, on the northeastern side of Theramore Isle.27248The Steamwheedle Cartel has recently established a new outpost in the southern part of Dustwallow Marsh. It's called Mudsprocket, if I recall, and it's located on the main road south out of Tabetha's Farm and the Stonemaul Ruins.This is an excellent opportunity for us to establish new trade contacts and Lady Jaina wants me to send a representative down there to establish contact. Would you be willing to go?27249Poor James never recovered from the destruction of the Shady Rest and the murder of his family. The boys and I are doing what we can to find the monsters who did this.I've sent our best investigator, Inspector Tarem, out to the ruins, but this is too big a job for any one man. If you'd lend Tarem a hand, we'd appreciate it. Light knows, we'd all like to be out there helping.The main road will lead you to the inn, but take care. Your journey will take you beyond the protection of my soldiers.27251I can't help it if I feel sorry for ol' Jim there. He wasn't always like that. Ran an inn out in the marsh for a while, wonderful place.Look, I don't really want to talk about it. Bring it up with Captain Vimes if you really have to. He's stationed on the top floor of Foothold Citadel, the large barracks to the east of Lady Jaina's tower.27252An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn.The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.27253If you follow the road south from the village, and then west toward the Barrens, you'll come across the ruins of the Shady Rest Inn.Theramore has sent an investigator to discover how the inn met its fate. I had a man placed in that inn as a spy and I don't trust in the competence of these humans to uncover what happened.Whatever you find, don't give a scrap of it to that investigator. We'll handle this ourselves.27254An iron shield, blackened by the fire that raged through the inn, is affixed to the crumbling chimney, one of the few remaining parts of the structure that once made up the Shady Rest Inn.The shield can be removed from the brick of the chimney.27255Hmm... I don't see anything out of the ordinary with this shield. We should have Do'gol, the blacksmith, take a look at it, and see if he can tell us more about it, but I wouldn't hold out hope...27256Hmmm, there's writing right here on the rim of the shield, but it's hard to read from all the burned stuff.I need acid to make it clear. Venom from the darkmist spiders would do good. The spiders have taken over an old mine, the Darkmist Cavern, northwest of the village. Get me some of their sacs and I can clean this up.27257Oh, I think I might have dropped too much acid onto the shield. Let me just rub a little...Hm, kind of hard to read, but it looks like the name Mosarn. Never heard of him. Maybe Krog knows. Krog knows many people.27258Ah, I remember now! Mosarn is a well-respected blacksmith in Thunder Bluff. I knew I had heard his name somewhere, before.In thanks, the Earthen Ring awarded me with a set of armor crafted by Mosarn. Very good work.Perhaps he can tell you more about the shield he crafted.It's not much of a lead, but since we didn't get anything useful out of Reethe, it's all we have.27259Rows of hoofprints lead away from the still-smoking skeleton of the Shady Rest Inn.

His soul was twisted by the Scourge, and he became a monster.Pamela's fate is sealed, but perhaps we can change Joseph's fate.A strange gnome arrived here at this tower not long ago.

Take the controlling runes that these cultists hold, aim them at the plague disseminators, then overcharge them with this mote.  The results should be amusing.27421Scourge forces have made it a point to ensure that nothing survives in the Fungal Vale - all you will find are husks of rotted mushrooms and scorched grasses.  The three corners of the vale are home to three large ziggurats, which they use to reanimate their dead and summon new soldiers to the battlefield.Yet even in this evil, lifeless place, life finds a way to flourish.

He seems certain that the hoofprints and the shield you found there point to the Grimtotem clan of tauren.With reports of Grimtotem activity on the rise in the marsh, this has to be more than a mere coincidence. I'm sending you to speak with Captain Darill, who is something of an expert on the Grimtotems. Follow the road north out of town to North Point tower. It's the second outpost on the road.27426The Grimtotems may be the most warlike of all the tauren clans, but they're by no means unorganized. If they're the ones who put the torch to the Shady Rest Inn, they'll have had orders from one of their clan elders.There's a large Grimtotem settlement called Blackhoof Village to the northwest. They've been using it as a base to attack the tower, but I'll bet that you'll find the orders you're looking for there. Check the village's elders for traces of the orders you seek.27427If the equipment you found at the ruins of the inn belonged to a Grimtotem attack party, there's likely to be more just like it within their camp to the northwest.We haven't been able to gather much information about Blackhoof Village, but judging from the size of the raiding parties, there's a substantial force based there.Do whatever you have to to capture some of their equipment so that we can compare it with your findings from the inn.27428I can't spare any men to help search for a second Grimtotem outpost, but I think I know of someone who might be able to help you.Deep in the Quagmire, to the south, there is a small farmstead owned by Tabetha.

Follow the road south to her farm and seek her help in finding the culprits responsible for the massacre at the Shady Rest Inn.27429There's no scrying necessary to see the trouble my new \"neighbors\" are creating. And if this is the band that burnt down the Shady Rest Inn, as you claim, there's no reason to tolerate their presence any longer.Take this torch and raze their camp to the ground! You'll find Direhorn just to the north of my farm, near the road. You can't miss it, really, as the Grimtotems have done a splendid job of announcing their presence with those totems they favor.27430Although these Grimtotems were simply a nuisance to me, Captain Vimes will want to know of your deeds. Bring him the news that you have tracked down and dealt with those responsible for the burning of the Shady Rest Inn.It's too late to save Jim Hyal's family, but perhaps the Grimtotems will think twice before attacking anyone connected to Theramore.27431That's it, .

Argus Highbeacon, the gentleman who works with the Argent Crusade, spoke with me earlier.  I understand he will be coming with us... that's great!  I'll make room for him.I know that you are busy, so there's no hurry.  Whenever you're ready, hop into the caravan, and we will proceed to the next tower.27449My name is Vex'tul, and I have watched you fight, .  You are strong.You killed my master, Zaeldarr, but this does not bother me.  I value strength over any loyalty that I held for him.  I value strength over anything else.Prove to me one final time your strength, .  Do so, and I will lend you MY strength for whatever purpose you may desire.27450I love the sea.  Yes, it was I, Frederick Calston, who introduced the sea life to that lake in the southwest.  I had hoped to provide the Crusade with a source of fresh food from within the borders of the Plaguelands.However, some of the fish turned out to be predators, and they now terrorize the other animals.  If we're not careful, they will kill them all!Swim down to the bottom of the scar and save some snails, crabs, and pufferfish before it's too late.27451Greetings, stranger!  You've entered the heart of the Plaguelands.  I hope you brought your undead-killing gear with you.The plague spreads more slowly these days, so the Cult of the Damned has stepped up production in order to keep the land brown and dead, as they like it.  I've got a plan to stop them.  Take my mortar and pestle, and use it on living rot from the undead creatures in Corin's Crossing to the southeast.  We're going to make a little present for the cultists!27452Some of my counterparts have told me that the land wants to heal, but several high-ranking undead - along with the Cult of the Damned - are not allowing it to.  That means we have to stop them!  I've got a plan, but first, you're going to need a cultist disguise.Head southeast into Corin's Crossing, and take the clothing from the human cultists that roam through the town.  I'll contact you when you've completed this step.27453Coagulated rot is potent on its own, but we need something to activate its concealed powers... a catalyst.  You can find just such a catalyst to the south, in Lake Mereldar.If you look down, you'll notice that I slipped a set of flasks into your bags while you weren't looking.  These flasks can be used on the water elementals in the lake.  The living, corrupted water that flows through their bodies will be the perfect catalyst!27454Now, mix a tiny amount of rot into the water, and mix thoroughly.  There, that's it.  This solution will still be very powerful, and we only need a little bit of it.On the lake's southeastern border, you will find a plague cauldron with several cultists nearby.  Put on your cultist disguise, then approach the cauldron and put in ONE DROP of the solution you made.  No more, or you may risk your very life!27455As soon as we arrived here at Light's Shield Tower, those two lunkhead paladins ran off to Light's Hope Chapel.  It's still a ways away, but if we're going to follow Argus along his tour of the towers, this is about as close as we're going to get.Check in on them and make sure they're alright?  I know they can handle themselves, but still, it'd make me feel better to know that you were watching over them while I'm stuck here with the caravan.27456We have problems maintaining our food supplies here in the far east.Around here, the only manner of beast unaffected by the ravages of the plague are the carrion worms. While rather bland in taste, the meat of the worms can easily be preserved to last for months. We will need several hundred more pounds to be fully-stocked.While you can find carrion worms all over the Plaguelands, they can be found in particularly high density to the south of the chapel.  And remember: larger worms mean more meat.27457With your contributions to the food stores, my current assignment is complete.I will be heading north, to the Plaguewood, next.  I understand you may be headed in the same direction.Do you mind if I join you on the road?I will head northwest, to Eastwall Tower.  If you're interested in teaming up, you can meet up with me there.27458Hey there!  Interested in makin' a buck?I need to get a bandage.  Well, actually, I got a friend who needs to get a bandage.  Well actually... let's just say it's complicated, but if you go get this bandage, you make money.  And so do I.  And my friend.  Possibly other people.Stephen Browman used to own the mill to the north, now he's dead.  A zombie.  The guy at the top wants to have the wrappings from Browman's body.What's the matter, you don't like money?27459The Brotherhood of Light has a history of brash, thoughtless decisions.  They bridged a gap between the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.  They were among the first to plunge into Northrend, while many of us lingered behind.However, they also have a history of getting results, which I respect.  They fight on two fronts now: one battle in Stratholme, and another, more immediate battle to the south at Tyr's Hand.I suggest you speak with Angela Dosantos at Tyr's Hand.  You may be of service.27460We were only given one hundred men to complete this mission, and we're already down by one.  Our scout was sent into the enemy stronghold to clear out some of the guards that patrol the area, and to send off a flare so we could enter with a coordinated attack.  Our ninety-nine remaining men lie at the ready, waiting for that flare.  I need a talented  like you to sneak into Tyr's Hand, take out as many of their guards as possible, and then set off that flare.Are you up to it?27461The Scarlet Crusade maintains a well-fortified abbey in the lower western tier of Tyr's Hand.  The abbey will need to be secured before proceeding any further into the stronghold.27462One of the key fortifications within Tyr's Hand is the barracks, which lies right next to this flare.  The Brotherhood of Light and their centurions will need all the help they can get in sacking it.27463I've always wanted to join the Crusade.  It's the reason I became a paladin.  Years of practice, honing my craft... I'm finally ready.Tarenar thinks he's ready, too, but I'm not sure.  He's a bit of a showboat, and he never took his lessons seriously.  Still, we promised we'd do this together, and here we are.Shall we head into the chapel now?27464Behind our chapel, you will find a small crypt.  Interred within are the bodies of our fallen heroes; those who gave their lives in the war against the Scourge.Their spirits are at peace, but they return intermittently to test new members of the order.The three of you may test together.  Enter the crypt, then read from this scroll.  Lord Raymond George - my predecessor - will preside over your test.27465Browman's Mill, to the north, is infested with undead.  The Noxious Glade, even farther to the north, is even more heavily infested.  Despite their proximity to our chapel, we have been unable to completely remove them.Vigilance is key.  Travel into the Noxious Vale and slay as many undead as you can find... and the cultists that roam among them.While there, make sure to avoid Garginox, the flesh giant that roams the vale.  I suspect you are not strong enough to defeat him.27466Tyrosus has given us our next task: slaying more undead in Northdale.  Gidwin is excited to move forward, but I think we should show a little more caution.Let's meet up with Fiona.  She should be at the next tower by now... Eastwall Tower, I think it's called.  It's close by, to the northwest of Light's Hope.  We can rest there, and plan our attack on Northdale.27467The Noxious Glade is a quagmire, both literally and figuratively.  There's enough Scourge up there to give us trouble for the rest of both of our lifetimes.They can re-animate the weaker ones when they die, .  They will never stop coming if we don't do something.Take these blades and drive them through the corpses of any Scourge troopers you find.  The blade is simple, but its enchantment will prevent the dead bones from being reanimated.  Forever.27468One by one, we're gonna have to pull our siege tanks outta the muck. Take these 'ere spare parts you've collected and give 'em to a siege tank commander who's standing on top of a gimped-up machine.Then defend the tank while engineers de-gimpify it.Go an' make me proud, !27469I come with news from Blackrock Spire. We have a new visitor. His name is Acride.He seeks people of strength, people of intelligence, of dexterity. You ought to go to Blackrock Spire and speak with him.27470It is no secret that we aren't fans of the orcs in Blackrock Mountain, but we do carefully watch their every move. Nothing happens in that Mountain without me knowing about it, .Recently, a different sort of orc came into Blackrock. He resides just inside Blackrock Spire, and I know he's somehow planning to overthrow Nefarian and his whole army of orcs. Normally I wouldn't trust their kind, but we share a common goal for the time being. Find him, he's called Acride.27471There is an orc inside Blackrock Spire much unlike the others. He speaks with the intelligence and wisdom of one beyond his appeared years, and does not fight against our soldiers like the others do.You must travel northwest to Blackrock Spire and find this orc, known only to us as Acride. Perhaps he is the key to stopping the orcish army. Perhaps we can stop Nefarian before it is too late...27472You are unwavering in your loyalty to the Forsaken, . Know that what you have done for us - for the Horde - will not go unnoticed. With Lord Godfrey and his men recovered, we will have a great advantage over the Gilneas Liberation Front and the rest of the Alliance dogs.Now stand by my side as Lord Godfrey is reborn as one of us. Together we will bring him and his men into the fold.27474While Godfrey and I make preparations for our assault upon Gilneas, I want you to lead our attack upon Ambermill, directly east of here.The former Dalaran magi of Ambermill have erected a magical barrier that somehow cloaks them from vision. They currently reside within some type of pocket dimension, awaiting orders from the Alliance to begin their attack. We must prevent their assault by making a pre-emptive strike. Venture to Ambermill and find information that would grant us access to the mages.27475The magi of Ambermill have employed foul magic to keep us away. Elemental servitors, created with immunities that we cannot breach, protect their territory.Venture east to Ambermill and slay the unyielding elemental servitors that guard the town and recover their cores. Bring their cores back to me so that I may devise a method by which we are able to destroy them all!27476Take the codex and travel north to the Sepulcher. Once there, find Dalar Dawnweaver. Dalar is a former archmage of the Kirin Tor. Surely he will be able to bring down the protective wards surrounding this codex and pry its secrets loose.Hurry, .27477North of here and west of Northdale, you will find the corpulent maggot beast, Borelgore.I've lost entire regiments to that monster. His size knows no bounds! The more he eats the greater his girth becomes...While I would not suffer any emotional harm should the beast devour you, I would prefer that you were the victor.  Borelgore has been known to devour others who tried to hunt him.27478The Dark Lady is correct in her assertion that I am able to unlock the codex. Unfortunately, I need a signet ring from a Dalaran archmage to do it. My own ring was taken when I died many years ago, but there still might be a way.While Dalaran has floated away, the outskirts of the city remain. Far to the east lie the ruins of Dalaran. It is there that you will find an archmage known as Relios. \"Take\" his signet ring and bring it back to me.You may use the portal behind me to get to the crater.27479The Mossflayers of Zul'Mashar spit in the face of the Light!  They cannibalize, they criminalize, they prioritize the forces of evil over good!  I advise that you remove their eyes, and give rise to the demise and the goodbyes of the unwise!You will travel north, and you will rain down on them with righteous justice and indignation, .  The fury that they have wrought in the eyes of the Light shall be channeled through you.27480The arcane remnant pulses with strange energy. Perhaps you should search for more remnants. Surely Dalar would be interested in such a find.27481It is time that I asked a favor of you, .Far to the north of Eastwall Tower, hidden among the hills, is the Mossflayer capital city of Zul'Mashar.  It was here that I was born, and here that I died.The traitor, Thresh'jin, sits atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat.  It was my every right to be there, but he took the seat from me with treachery and deceit.  He is not strong.  He is weak.I will meet you in Zul'Mashar, and we will kill him.  Your strength and mine.  Together.27482This is the last time you will see me, .  I am leaving the caravan.If you want to continue fighting by my side, hang on to Thresh'jin's body.  I can wait for a while longer.  When you are ready to say goodbye, throw the body into the bonfire atop Zul'Mashar's ziggurat.Thank you for your companionship, .  You were strong.27483Under ordinary circumstances I am not a vengeful man. In fact, I am somewhat of a pragmatist. You see, practicality is a paradoxical notion to vengeance. Most revenge ploys are highly impractical.BUT... in this case - since you're already going to the ruins of Dalaran - you might as well kill every Dalaran affiliated human that you see. The reasons that I want them dead range from hatred to anger to betrayal, but I assure you they are all legitimate gripes. Do this for me and I will pay you handsomely.27484HAHAH!Oh... That's bad.With this ring only ONE may enter the pocket dimension at Amber Mill. That person will then need to fight through an army of magi and kill the archmage that is generating the phase from the inside. Only then will the dimension fold, ejecting all of the magi.The portal to entry is hidden at the back of a cave in Beren's Peril.That's all I know. Take the ring back to Sylvanas.27485I'm glad you're back! Saving the world or something, I'm sure.I was dispatched to establish relations with the red dragons in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at Wyrmrest were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.A problem solver as it were.Care to take a crack at earning a bit of trust with Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest? Anything that might soften her up a bit for me would be lovely.27486Good. You're back. Saving the world again I assume.I was dispatched to establish relations with the red dragons in the area, but I'm finding this bunch somewhat less accommodating than the ones at Wyrmrest were. I have, however, been told that you are the type that solves problems.A problem solver as it were.I need you to gain the trust of Lirastrasza at Vermillion Redoubt to the southwest. Our association with the Dragonmaw has complicated things, but I'm hoping you can ease relations.27487I know we're supposed to head to Northdale, but that can wait, right?  Besides, this lovely little goblin was just telling me about some Scourge that are even closer by.So apparently there's this nerubian underlord named Ix'lar that has been trying to make a name for himself ever since the Lich King was slain.  He's set up a camp of undead to our north.Sure, Tyrosus wants us to kill banshees in Northdale.  We'll get to that.  But let's kill this nerubian first, while we're close!27488Damn that dwarf.  He's always getting me in trouble with Fiona.  Look at her!  She won't even TALK to me!I'm going to stay here and try to mend my friendship with our worgen friend.  Would you mind going out and making sure Gidwin is alright?  I'm sure he's fine; he knows how to take care of himself.  He headed north, and he can't have gone far.27489This is my fault.  I... I ignored his warnings, his complaints, everything.  I couldn't help myself - I saw those Scourge just beyond the tower, and I... I HAD to go kill them.Argus says that Gidwin was taken northwest, and that's our only lead, so that's where we'll head.Northdale and the Argent Crusade be damned!  We're getting Gidwin back from those Scourge trash.27490Mathias Shaw and the SI:7 are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there.The Wildhammer are being kind enough to give us a lift in. The agents have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though.Speak with Angus Stillmountain and get yourself a squad to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big blue X marks the spot.27491Garona and a detachment of the Kor'kron are here to assist us with operations up top in the Twilight Citadel. I need you to escort them there.I've called upon a local tribe of trolls to give us a lift in with their wind riders. The assassins have some things that they need to do down in the Twilight Gate area first, though.Speak with the troll chief, Jon-Jon Jellyneck and get yourself a detachment of Kor'kron to drop off. You'll fly them in. A big red X marks the spot.27492As with any offensive, you first need to soften them up. We've been having a heck of a time getting in there. But someone like you... well, let's just say I have no doubt in my mind that you can get into the Twilight Gate to the southwest and teach the Bloodeye Clan ogres and ettins a thing or two!27493I want you to get in there past those boulders to the northwest at the Twilight Gate. Kill every Bloodeye Clan ogre and ettin in sight. Think you can handle that for me, ?27494If the Twilight Gate is to fall, we need to get Skullcrusher the Mountain out of there!Before they left, I saw to it that your SI:7 agents took some explosives hidden in a Twilight's Hammer crate. By now, they will have planted them on the steps leading up to the upper portion of the Citadel.I want you to set the explosives off and then signal us when that monster's out of the way.That's when we'll attack and finish off the ogre compound!27495If the Twilight Gate is to fall, we must get Skullcrusher the Mountain out of there!Before they left, I saw to it that your Kor'kron assassins took some explosives hidden in a Twilight's Hammer crate.

These monsters deserve nothing better than to be destroyed by the weapons in our hands. However, this particular situation calls for the use of more powerful measures.Take this flare and mark each of the four buildings within the Twilight Gate to the southwest. Our cannons will handle the rest.27497A pity that we're no longer allowed to drop the Plague on our enemies. It would prove quite effective in this situation. Oh well, at least we have war machines to destroy their precious gates.I want you to take this flare. Use it to mark each of the four buildings within the Twilight Gate to the northwest. The war machines will handle the rest.27499Now that you've lured Skullcrusher the Mountain away from the Twilight Gate, it's time to signal your forces at Crushblow to attack!27502Now that the attack is underway, it's time to deal with the Twilight Citadel. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to escort the SI:7 forces to Master Mathias Shaw.He's hiding somewhere up top. The SI:7 squad commander can tell you where.Thank you, . We look forward to joining you in the assault upon the Citadel!27503Now that the attack is underway, it's time to deal with the Twilight Citadel. If you don't mind, I'd like for you to escort the Kor'kron forces up to Garona.She's hiding somewhere up top. The Kor'kron squad commander can tell you where.Thank you, . We look forward to joining you in the assault upon the Citadel!27504I won't be so impolite as to refuse your aid if you're offering it.We're locked in constant battle with the twilight drakes and dragons to the south. Our strikes have not been entirely without success, but the dragons coming out of Grim Batol have been breathing some kind of corruption upon us that takes time to cleanse.Velastrasza and Baleflame are attending to our injured brothers. Go and see if you can be of help to them.27505Our dragons are returning from battle covered in Twilight corrupted flame and pursued by Twilight drakes.My menders can tend to our dragons' wounds, but they must be defended. Keep the drakes off of my menders. Lend your healing to our dragons as well if you are able.Thank you for your help with this. Our battles for Grim Batol are never-ending. We need to get our strongest dragons back into the battle as soon as possible.27506, I have a task for you.Take these ruby seeds and plant them at the corpses of any dragonkin that you come across. Twilight or Vermillion, whelping or dragon, it matters not. We need to see that their bodies are returned to the earth so that life can continue to flourish.In death, there should always be new life. This may be our one consolation during times of war and great tragedy.27507Fragile Twilight invaders litter the redoubt. They're pouring in from somewhere to the west.There can be no mercy offered to them within this hallowed place. Whatever violence grips your moral heart, release it upon them.27508Look... I know you have no reason to be fond of me, just as I'm not terribly fond of you, but I need any help I can get.Our eggs are being stolen by these Twilight invaders. I have no doubt that they want to take them back to Grim Batol to experiment on and pervert. I will NOT let that happen.If you truly do want to help us, stop them! Recover the eggs. Bring them back to me.27509Every inch of air and every hill surrounding the redoubt is constantly under the watchful eye of Lira's drakes. They must have found a way into the shrine from beneath.Take this Flashgrowth mote. It should prove more than sufficient to close any hole, tunnel, or portal they might have used to get inside our defenses.Find the breach in our defenses. Close it.27510These worgen take us for fools! One would think that only an idiot would mistake one of their druids in bear form as a real bear. Unfortunately, there are many idiots here at the Forsaken Front. We've already lost a few battalions to organized worgen bear attacks. Yes, it's even more idiotic than it sounds.Directly east of here, heading towards Hillsbrad, you will find worgen druids roaming the woods, masquerading as bears. Kill them and make our southern supply line safe again.27511What a find! And somehow it's all remained untouched by plunderers...Listen, . I need to document this site before we disturb anything. While I do, why don't you have a look around - you know, explore a bit. You've earned it.Keep your eyes open for anything unusual.Oh! And please... don't break anything, ok?27512Take the ring and make your way to Beren's Peril, southeast of here, located in a cave in the hills. Once there, search the cave for the portal to the pocket dimension that conceals the Ambermill magi.I will communicate with you through your thoughts, . Once you have reached the portal I will give you your marching orders.27513You are now ready to use the portal. Be warned, , once you step through you will appear in another dimension at Ambermill. There will be a hundred, perhaps a thousand, magi waiting to kill you.You must persevere and kill all in your path.27514While you were fighting along the coast, I spotted a gryphon tumble out of the clouds almost due west of here.It wasn't one of ours.Likely it belonged to one of the Wildhammer. I know that Kurdran wanted to establish contact with the lost Wildhammer clans as one of his primary objectives after taking the beach. I can't spare any more of my men to scout it out, but I can spare you. Find that downed Wildhammer!27515Look here, mate. She's on her last legs! If me bird dies, I'm as good as worthless.So make yerself useful. Here on the peninsula you can dig up thorny stankroots. Oh the smell will knock you on yer patoot but steeped in water it'll boil up into a right powerful cure-all.Gather some while I defend me bird. An' hurry! You Alliance wanks don't have a reputation for timely intervention, right?27516Aye, look! I think she's perkin' up already.Okay  Alliance fancy-pants . Is that your base I see on the shore? \"Highbank\" you say. Can me and my bird hunker down there until she's better?Hop on! We'll fly together back to Highbank!27517Every adventurer worth their salt knows never to step foot in a cave, dungeon, crypt or tomb without an ample supply of rope... right?You can never have too much of this stuff!You resolve to scrounging every scrap of it you can find from the skeletons here.27518You must find the being responsible for keeping this dimensional pocket active. Likely that fool, Ataeric... Search the compound for him. Should you find him, do what you must to stop him from channeling his magic. He is undoubtedly protected by a powerful arcane shield, and will send minions of arcane energy after you.  Defeat the minions while they are near him to unleash their energies.  No mage can handle that much power!27519No... it cannot be.Orsis is all but buried beneath the desert sands.The enemy will pay for this.But first we must aid my people.  Quick, .  We do not have much time before the last of my brethren are buried alive!27520Al'Akir has sent his minions to do Deathwing's bidding.The message is clear.  We join them or they destroy us.I do not know much about you, .  But I do know this.  If you prove yourself to be an enemy of Al'Akir's, your aid will not go unnoticed.What do you say, ?27521... please, I ask your help.Something's happened to my people.  Our commander, Ranger Lord Hawkspear, came upon an item of magical energy, and my friends, my family... they succumbed to its seductive power.They're corrupted, .  All of them.My Ellaria wouldn't want to live like that, nor would any of my brothers.  Please, put them out of their misery.  Quel'lithien Lodge is not far; it's just up the hill, to the northwest.27522We paladins are normally taught to exercise judgment and control when dealing with foes, but this is an emergency, and I never paid too much attention to my trainers anyhow.I'm going to head into the Plaguewood and find out what I can about Giddy.  You deal with the Scourge just to our northeast, on the other side of this tower.  The undead don't fear death, but if you beat them enough, their tongues might slip, and we may get some clues to Gidwin's location.27523I have seen many things in my day, .  The peaks of Mt. Hyjal... the oddities of Outland... a wall of Scourge soldiers, proceeding into war.  But I have never seen a bat as big, or as shockingly white, as Duskwing.How he taunts me from his roost!This albino demon bat circles to the southwest of here, due north of Blackwood Lake.  Track him down and destroy him.  If he flies too high for you to reach, use my flare to get his attention.27524Tarenar wasn't joking when he said that he didn't care about judgment and caution.  He nearly took off that high elf's head as he ran into the Plaguewood, looking for Gidwin.  You should go after him.The Plaguewood is a big place, .  Good luck.  I hope to see you  come out of the woods in one piece.27525Baroness Anastar holds him?  Here in the Plaguewood?The Plaguewood is a big place... but we will find him.  We WILL find Gidwin.Immediately to our east and our west are a pair of necropoli that flank the entrance to Stratholme.  Inside them, you will find a pair of death knights - Rivendare's lieutenants.  I doubt either would have any use for a paladin hostage, but perhaps they will have some information on his location.27526Quickly - find an entrance to the slaughterhouse to our south.  I will meet you on the inside.Be ready for a fight!27527I've had just about enough of the funk of this place.  Undead stink is bad enough, and then you add mushrooms to the mix?  I hate mushrooms!I'm going to head back to Light's Hope Chapel, ... and I'm taking Tarenar and Fiona with me.  I think we've all earned a well-deserved break.Let me give you this.  It's my hearthstone - you can use it to travel instantly back to Light's Hope.  I won't need it - I'm going to be riding in the caravan.In the FRONT SEAT.27528You can't just kill the Scourge.  They will come back.  You must destroy the vile matter that makes up their being... and even then, they may come back as spectres.Few undead use up as much mass as the lumbering abominations.  Kill them, then burn their bodies.  You will find them all over the Plaguewood.Never let your rage dissipate, .  Remember: these abominations are sewn together from the bodies of good people.  Their crime is that they exist.27529The battle of Darrowshire was one of the many tragedies that we humans suffered at the hands of the Scourge.  Its effects are still felt even today.Many of the town's valiant defenders now roam again as the ghastly servants of the Scourge.  We will end their misery.Hunt cannibal ghouls here within the Plaguewood.  Many of these fiends were once the good folk of Darrowshire, and destroying their forms now will set their souls free.27530To the south, gutless cultists are focused on a grim task: re-animating enormous hunks of flesh, to create giants known as corpsebeasts.  Luckily for us, these giants are still lifeless and weak.Take this charm - using it will place a font of holy energy on the ground.  If you can manage to place three of them near one of the corpsebeasts that the cultists are reanimating, the holy energy should overload it, destroying its body forever.27531I once worked for the so-called \"Banshee-Queen\", Sylvanas, as an apothecary.

We have settled with the high elves of the Quel'Danil Lodge, to the northwest, to train in the ways of the Light and enjoy the peaceful beauty of this land.Such peace may be short lived.

Eels don't even like eels.Azeroth would be a better place if no one ever had to envision an eel slithering out from the murky depths and biting them.In the face.27733Look, I'd love to give the order and have my men blast these rebels to bits right now, but I can't because the entire Stockade is under Warden Thelwater's jurisdiction, and he only wants to contain them right now.Rather than disobey orders, we're going to take care of this in a slightly different manner! We've managed to befriend Mortimer Moloch, who just so happens to be the ruthless rebel leader Randolph Moloch's twin. Kill Randolph, and we'll switch 'em so Mortimer can stop the rebellion peacefully!27737I'm well-versed in first aid and other forms of healing, and with the help of my Lightwell I've been able to nurse many of our men back to full health. The problem we still have is that it's so cold and damp down here that I'm losing them anyways, despite healing their wounds!The quakes angered the elements that reside in the prison...when they erupted out of the earth they slaughtered half of the prisoners.

Seek out and crush Wildhammer Warbrands. The best among them carry insignias - my warriors collect them by the dozen.Can you?27752S'not a boast to say that we Thundermars brew the finest ale in the Eastern Kingdoms. It's 220 proof. Yeah, you heard me!As folks fled from the south to the town center, they were forced to leave behind their ale.GET IT BACK! That stuff'll turn even the stringiest of warriors into a whirlin' dervish of mouth-foaming destruction. Get them kegs! S'our only hope!27753Supplies are short, . We've got refugees coming into Thundermar from up and down the ridge - that's a lot of mouths to feed.Plenty of food stores were left behind as people pulled their families to safety.

I even saw some naga wander ashore the other day.Something's calling them here, and working them into a frenzy to boot. Many of the creatures have been drawn to Stagalbog Cavern to the west.

I got a job opportunity that you aren't gonna want to miss out on.We been sent up here from Fuselight, a new goblin town way down in the Badlands.  Lots of money to be had down there, yes .  And not nearly so many zombies... or uptight Argent paladin-types.Nope, it's an untamed wilderness down there, and we're looking for someone like you to help us tame it.  Whenever you're ready... we'll be waiting.27763This, , is paradise.  I've always wanted to live in a nice quiet town by the sea so I can focus on my explosions without any distractions.Quiet's not for everybody, though... 'specially the adventuring hero-type, like yourself.We've installed a teleporter in the backside of town that'll take you up to the top of the cliffs.  From there, you can take the quick ride west into Fuselight proper, within the Badlands.There should be more for you to do up there.  Tell 'em that Flo sent you.27764On to other matters.  I have a package that I need delivered.A young lady came by our town not long ago, looking for compressed blasting powder, a tempered mithril bomb casing, and some safety goggles.  Naturally, we had plenty of blasting powder and bomb casings to sell her, but the safety goggles were a little harder to find.Long story short, I've got the goggles, but she's already returned to her studies down in Lethlor Ravine.  Will you bring these down to her?27765I am experimenting with black dragons.  Specifically, I am interested in how they procreate.My current experiments require plenty of black dragon eggs, which is why I am here in Lethlor Ravine.  I'd gather the eggs myself, but I think you'll benefit from helping me out.You will find them along the edges of the ravine.  Beware the guardians that circle above - they do not appreciate stolen eggs.27766I need another favor from you.  I need you to obtain the bodies of the black dragon whelplings that fly nearby.  Slay them, and bring the corpses to me.27768The trolls here perpetuate the fall of my brethren to the nightmare. They infect and corrupt green dragons with the blood of their foul god, and then harvest the evil that has grown within them. They are being farmed like livestock...This disgusting savagery cannot continue. Return to where you left the Hall of Masks and take the other corridor towards the Butchery. Gomora the Bloodletter harvests corpses for these foul and evil rituals there. Take his undeserved life from him!27769As I hinted earlier, I am no ordinary goblin.  You may have already guessed my true identity.Allow me to show you my true form.  As you have proven yourself trustworthy, I will also share with you the details of my plan.27770The black dragonflight was once noble.  They were the earth warders, protecting the very land itself.  How ironic that they would become the worst menace the land has known.I believe that there remains a sliver of hope, however, and so does my mistress.  The black dragonflight will live beyond Deathwing's treachery, and will soar as the noble earth warders once again.I wish to show you something.  Close your eyes, and I will reveal to you the final part of my studies.27771Nyxondra is being held against her will.  She is hidden from her brood, right in the middle of their breeding grounds.  She lays eggs, but they will be taken away before she can see them hatch.Cruel?  Perhaps... but not nearly as cruel as the treatment that their dragonflight showed my mistress.Show me that I can trust you, .  Take Nyxondra's eggs, and bring them here.  You will need to beat Nyxondra into submission before you can take them.27772I made a calculated decision in revealing my identity to you, .  I needed you to trust me, but I can no longer stay here in Lethlor Ravine, as my cover has quite clearly been blown.You may be able to slip away unnoticed, however.  Here, take the results of our research, and bring them west.  At Agmond's End, you will find a gnome who knows what to do with these samples.Hurry, !  You mustn't loiter here any longer than necessary!27773All that yet stands between me and the temple is Prophet Jammal'an himself. He is the leader of the Atal'ai trolls here, a foul manipulator.Know that you do not face a mere crazed troll, , but an instrument of forces beyond your darkest comprehension. Yet you do not fight alone; my strength and the will of the Green Dragonflight go with you.Proceed to the Den of the Caller, left through the Hall of Ritual, and then down into the Hall of Bones. At the bottom, you will find Jammal'an.27774The most immediate threat to Fuselight is, without argument, the colony of ogres to the northwest.Most of our ogre neighbors used to be warrior-types, but it seems that more and more of them are practicing magic.  I won't have an army of ogre-magi at my doorstep.Go take out some of those Dustbelcher ogres.  Hopefully they'll get the picture and avoid messing with the might of Fuselight.27775I just can't get my invention to work!  Gah!That's it, I've decided.  I'm going to cheat and use magic.What my invention really needs is a solid piston that's thin enough to fit through a narrow copper tube, but strong enough to withstand repeated impact without breaking.  The magical rods carried by those ogre magi to the north should work perfectly.From what I can tell, only the instructors carry the strong staves.27776We have a little bit of a goat problem here in Fuselight, in case you haven't noticed.  They'll eat anything, and they seem to have taken a liking to the piles of cogs and gears that we tend to leave sitting around.It's getting really annoying!You'll find most of the billy goats wandering around the edge of town, near the cliff's edge.  Use this device on them to give 'em a little \"nudge\".27777The expedition's numbers are extremely large, user .Dealing with them by conventional means would take you an estimated 2,700,136.5 hours.We can make use of a powerful source of energy held within expedition's crawler vehicle.We will need the fusion core's access codes to accomplish this.Mekgineer Twizzleflux has these codes and can be found at the Starwatch Tower to the southeast.I've uploaded jamming frequencies to a scrambler.  Use it to temporarily disable Twizzleflux's defenses.27778It is true.  New expedition crews have arrived by sea.My scanners detect that they already have been afflicted by the curse phenomenon.You must hurry and go aboard the M.A.C. Diver.  The access codes will give us control over the fusion core's functions, but there is still a layer of security we must bypass.User , I must ask you to hack a very sophisticated mainframe known as the \"Wibson.\"Do not worry I will provide you with further instructions.27779I have downloaded my program to the fusion core and have complete control over it.I've created a small pocket of air inside to avoid vaporizing user .I will yield control of all movement functions so I can dedicate my cycles to keeping the core stable.Go down the hill and neutralize as many of the expedition members as possible.My analysis reveals you might feel... \"guilt\" as a result of such high fatality numbers.User , you must be assured that expedition members are without hope.27781He-hello? , are you there? Are you still alive? Hello?Oh good, you're still there! What in the name of Lordareon are they building? It's some sort of mechanized monstrosity! You have to stop them from completing that...that...thing! Throw out the rules, do whatever you have to do to thwart them!27782We've had some good times. I'm really sorry to see you go. But, Mathias says he needs you.He said it's urgent!So, you want to grab a drink or something after whatever, ?27783We've had some good times. I'm really sorry to see you go. But, Garona says she needs you.She said it's urgent!So, you want to grab a drink or something after whatever, ?27784While you were in the mine, I was able to figure out where the Hammer of Twilight is being kept. They created it at the Altar of Twilight to the south.More important than that, the cultists have made a critical error: Cho'gall is personally overseeing its final construction.Many SI:7 died to bring us this information.27785I can't believe it...they're almost done rebuilding it! We don't have much time, .Admiral Ripsnarl, Vanessa's right hand man, is bound to be on board. We'll never get to her if he's still alive to do anything about it. You're going to need to scale the unfinished Juggernaut, find Ripsnarl, and kill him so we can get to Vanessa's private quarters on the top deck.Be careful, the Admiral bears the worgen curse and would take much pleasure in digging his claws into you!27786While you were in the mine, I was able to figure out where the Hammer of Twilight is being kept.

Cho'gall lured you in with the Hammer of Twilight so that his gronn could finish you off.Survive and slay Skullcrusher the Mountain!27789I'll need some time to analyze these samples, as well as a break from this trogg-shooting duty.  Go man one of my turrets and take out as many troggs as you can.  I'll be here studying.The turrets have two abilities: a regular shot, as well as an electrical overload, for when too many enemies get close!  Heh, heh.  Good luck.Oh, and look out for the big, slow troggs.  You probably don't want to let them anywhere near you.27790Hello there, . I've heard a great deal about you. Listen closely, you're only going to have one solid shot at this.The new Defias Kingpin must be inside the hut orchestrating this entire operation. I want you to go inside and take her down, for the sake of the hundreds of innocent people the organization her father started has killed and terrorized.I'm shocked that she would let you get so close to her domain without fleeing and waiting until more favorable conditions, but it seems we're in luck.27791I've got an idea, but it's a bit of a long shot.  Thankfully, long shots happen to be a specialty of mine.North of here, the Explorers' League has uncovered a new set of titan ruins beneath the sands.  If there's anything older and wiser than dragons, it's titans.  Heck, I've heard rumors that the titans CREATED the dragons.Talk to Lead Prospector Durdin at the camp to the north.  He'll have more information than I do about these titans.What did I tell you?  It's a long shot.27792First things first, though.  I'm not just going to sit here and tell you everything we've discovered down in those ruins.  We've got problems to take care of!Most pressing is those upstart Reliquary hooligans, just on the other side of the tomb.  They're makin' off with all of our loot!  Don't they know that diggin's dwarf work?Hunt down a few of their \"excavators\" - more like bandits, if you ask me - and bring some of these precious artifacts back to me.THEN we'll talk titans.27793You heard a good amount of rumbling happen in the tomb's central chamber.  Those two large statues did look awfully suspicious.27794Inside the chest, you find a small, circular device, resting upon a cushion.If there are any titan artifacts to be found here in the tomb, this is it.  You resolve to bring it back to Dr. Blam.27795The battle's proceeding just the way I wanted it. With their warriors nearly exhausted, I've sent in our cavalry.What I wasn't expecting was ogres. Our knights are well matched against the brutes, but they're going to need help.I need you back on the field right away, . Few can bring down an ogre on foot, but I think I can count on you. Don't disappoint me.27796Once those Reliquary honks got here, we panicked, and we all just started looting indiscriminately.A lot of bad archaeology happened that day.Luckily, Olga happened upon this small jade statue.  We thought it to be a key of some sort, but can't figure out what it opens.  Maybe you'll have some better luck with it.27797We very nearly had this statue stolen from us by one of Bloodwatcher's Reliquary stooges.  We managed to catch him in the act, and we've retrieved the statue, but it hasn't really paid off.It appears to be a key of some sort, but I can't find the lock anywhere inside those ruins.  You feel like giving it a try?27798Take my Water of Life and pass it into the corpse of the drowned dwarf.He was a worker of metals in life, and though his body now feeds my loch, the Water will allow him to tell you what you want to know.Then take your information and be gone from my demesne.27803I've got boys formin' defensive lines on all sides of the town, keepin' back the elementals streaming from the torn ground. They're good lads and they've been holdin' firm, but even the sturdiest dwarf tires eventually.They're split into shifts: one hour of rest for every hour on the line. Best I can get'm with the men we have.If you want to be helpin', pick a line and take up a shift. Give some of my boys a welcome breather. Report back in once you've killed several of the elementals.27804We've already been pushed back farther than I'd hoped, but I'm not about to give up our homes to these mongrels. They may burn them, pillage them, and spit on the rubbled remains, but we'll still fight to take them back.That being said, I rather like them not burnt. I have the boys running buckets from the well to try to keep the fire down. If you'd join them, they can help out by tossing you buckets so you don't have to make the runs.27805You're the new face that's meant to be helping Keegan out I take it? Pleasure to meet you. Maybe you can lend a favor or two more to the troubled Wildhammer that have made refuge here.We were all forced to retreat to this building quickly, and some of us left behind things of great value in our destroyed homes nearby. Would you mind bringing them back after you go out there? You would bring happiness to some very troubled souls.27806Iain, my second in command, bore the body of one of our fallen heroes to the cathedral to the west. He's the man I've put in charge of reforming a wing of gryphon riders from whatever scattered forces he can find. I would like you to help him.I should impress upon you the urgency of this task. We will not be able to hold here forever; the Twilight's Hammer or the Dragonmaw orcs will eventually overwhelm us. Putting together an active gryphon wing may be our only hope for surviving these conflicts.27807If we're going to pull a full gryphon wing back together, we're going to need to move fast to gather the survivors before they leave or get picked off. I've got a bead on a few groups of riders that stuck together. I'm leavin' to find the Thundermar riders and the Moore riders shortly.The Mullans were heading up west to the Crucible of Carnage last I saw. Go see if you can convince Duglas Mullan to join up with Keegan - he should owe him a favor or three.27808The Doyle riders were last spotted convergin' in the trees to the south, on the border of the Obsidian Forest. They're a stubborn bunch and are likely to take some convincin' if they're going to join up with us.Your best bet with Keeland Doyle is to tell'm Cailin Longfellow's taken up shelter with us back at the town. Keeland's got a good soft spot for her and she just might be enough to convince him to drag all his boys along.27809I also need ya to seek out Mackay and his men on the other side of the Devouring Breach, at the Gorshak War Camp.The Dragonmaw didn't survive the initial onslaught, and Mackay's lookin' to ransack what he can of their camp to supply our fight. There shouldn't be much convincin' necessary, but they'll likely want a hand wrappin' things up there before they make their way back to Keegan.Give'm a boot in the arse from ol' Iain if ya have to.27810Keegan wants the Mullans to take wing with'm eh? If there's a dwarf I'd fly for, he'd be it. Still, I don't get why he'd be sendin' an outsider to be recruitin' me - not right polite by my standards.I'm guessin' ya don't last 20 seconds with any of my boys, at the bar or in the battlefield. Prove me wrong. Take one of'm down in a fight and then I'll think about flyin' with ol' Keegan.27811Don't let Duglas fool you, the Mullans have been itchin' to take wing again, and if there's anyone we'd do it for, it's Firebeard.We left our gryphons in the Highland Forest to the south to hunt and to get away from the sounds of battle for a bit. They deserved a rest.If you want us back in the air soon, you'd do well to help us bring our gryphons back in.Take this piece of charred highland birch. We use it during training - as soon as they smell it, they'll come straight back to us.27812Your point's made. Keegan can count on us. We'll meet'm back at town as soon as all the boys are rallied up.You're tough for not bein' a Wildhammer. Guess they breed'm good where you come from too.Still, haven't seen ya drink yet. That'll be the real test.27813The Twilight sacked this town, killin' most of the Dragonmaw that lived in it. A few survived though, and they're not right keen on us takin' liberties with their supplies.Not that that matters much.Well, I'm not right keen on them attackin' my boys. Kill'm off, chase'm out - I don't care, just get'm gone.27814Stay back and forge more weapons?  Pah!  A Forgehammer has ne'er been afraid of battle!  Who needs the safety of home to make weapons?  Besides - there is oodles of raw material out here.  Those Dragonmaw weapons are worthless, but they can be smelted down to make actual weapons.  Bring me 8 Dragonmaw weapons so me daughter and I can forge real weapons out of them.27815Cleaned up the camp and ran errands for Forgehammer?  Not bad for a wee .  Take these to Iain at Firebeard Cemetery, and he should reward you for a job well done.27816Shame about the Doyles. It's a fair miracle that as many of us made it out as is though, so can't count it as much of a surprise.Those louts at Thundermar are cowards. Even after tellin' them it was Keegan askin', they won't set foot outside of their town. I did rope in the Moores though, so that's at least three clans' worth.Keegan wanted to hear from ya personally when you returned. Go find'm in town.27817Thanks to you and Iain, we've got enough riders together that we can take the fight back to the Twilight.We're trained to fight while ridin', but a second rider to handle the Stormhammer tends to be more efficient. I thought you might enjoy the honor.Pick your gryphon and join the fight. Best be quick about it though - we're aimin' to clear every last one of those Twilight off of those floatin' rocks before the hour's out.27818I settled here well before Bogpaddle was founded, to brew my potions and find some peace and quiet. I know this swamp like the back of my old, gnarly hand.There's been a change in the wildlife recently. Those winged snakes you may have seen in the stagalbog are wind serpents, and they haven't been seen around here for ages.They're also prime for ingredients if they're the kind I'm thinking of. Be a dear and gather me some of their hearts, will you?27821With war raging across the entire world, the last thing we need is a Horde settlement right in our backyard. Redridge, Duskwood, even Elwynn itself are all a day's march from here.We've made the first strike, and I don't plan to give the Horde a chance to catch their breath. So consider yourself deployed. Grab a weapon, join the rest of the troops out in the Bloodmire, and start killing orcs.Report back here after you've done some damage. I want you back alive...and that's an order. Dismissed!27822I want victory to be totally assured here. Having more resources isn't enough; we need to make sure the enemy has nothing.Stonard's forces depend on the lumber gathered from the surrounding woods. The orcish peons that chop the lumber may not be warriors, but they still know nothing but hate for humans.Show no mercy. I want those peons killed and the supply of lumber to Stonard cut off completely.27823I can appreciate a good diggin' as much as any other dwarf, don't get me wrong.  It's just that... well, we do so much diggin', and so little drinkin', that sometimes I wonder if I should just hang up me shovel and head back to Ironforge.But not today.  I've got some diggin' in me yet.Those Dark Iron dwarves at Hammertoe's Digsite - just north of here - make some powerful fine beer, right here in the desert.  You think you could pick up a few for me?27824I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.Those Dark Irons were here before Durdin and his crew arrived.  That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the dark irons were the first ones in there, lootin' all the good stuff.  I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.You've more than proven your ability to wallop a dwarf.  Head on into that fortress and wallop your way to titan treasure.I'd go with, but I'm drunk.27825We're hard-up for supplies, stranger.  With the black dragons raining destruction on what would be our hunting grounds, we have no way to get food.The ogres to our southwest, however, have exactly what we need.  Within their grotto you should find plenty of meat and crafting supplies.They may put up a fight.  Be on your guard.27826D... did you see that?  Incredible!  My titan thing idea worked!  With your help, of course.We'll want to get this back to Rhea.  She's not at Lethlor Ravine anymore; it sounds like she blew her cover pretty well when she transformed into her true form in front of all those whelps.  She's now in the west, staying at an Alliance camp called Dragon's Mouth.She'll be waiting for you.  And for that egg.27827In my haste to escape from Lethlor Ravine, I forgot to tie up one loose end: Nyxondra.  She's free, and she's sounded the alarm among the black dragonflight.  Half the flight is here in the western Badlands, combing for this egg.I'll take care of hiding the egg.  You're going to take care of some of the more troublesome dragons.  And you'll have help.Talk to Eric, over on the other side of camp.  He and his brothers will be joining you.27828Before we get too crazy what with the dragon-killin', let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.\"The Swift\" is what they call me, and here's why: I'll dash straight into your enemies - helmet first, mind you - and stun 'em for a few seconds.  I also keep a few potions with me for tight spots.Why don't we practice fightin' together?  Head out into the field, and try out my abilities.27829Hello, .  It looks like you four have had time to become well-acquainted.I have my first assignment for you.  Kalaran, an ancient black dragon of considerable power, has joined in the hunt for the egg we are protecting.  We need to stop him before he gets too close.You will find him and his minions at the Dustbowl, northeast of Dragon's Mouth.  Hunt him down and defeat him.  You will likely need the help of your new dwarven allies.27830The black dragonflight means business.  It appears that they've taken over a large portion of New Kargath, the large Horde settlement northwest of Dragon's Mouth.  Their troops are under the command of General Jirakka and his champion, Moldarr.  They must be stopped.We dragons do not take part in the squabbles between Horde and Alliance, but I do understand the risk you take in entering New Kargath.  Please, heroes... be careful.27831My greatest regret is the treatment that we - no, I - gave to Nyxondra.  I forced her to lay eggs, then I performed experiments on them.  Over, and over, and over again.Even as a mother myself, I can only imagine her sorrow.No... I mustn't be weak.  Our work is, after all, for the benefit of future generations of black dragons.  Her sacrifice was necessary.She circles the Ruins of Kargath, northwest of New Kargath, insane with fury.  Please, heroes... put her out of her misery.27832With the major black dragons out of the Badlands, it is now safe to move the egg again.  You will find me on a small plateau, north of New Kargath.Come and find me.27833I'd say we have a dragon problem, but it seems like they're a little more interested in New Kargath than they are in our small encampment.  Nevertheless, I've got top men focused on keeping the dragons at bay.One problem that has gone unchecked, however, is the ogre camp to our southwest.  A small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside of their hovel.We can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier.  Thin their ranks before they thin ours.27834Before I start droppin' arrows on those dragons, I'd better introduce myself.I'm Baelog, the muscle of this group.  My sword bites like a crocolisk, and my arrows sing like banshees.  I tend to wear down quickly, however, and can't take as much punishment as either of my two brothers.You give the word, and I'll send an aimed shot right through your target's heart.  I can also cheer my brothers on, sending 'em into a battle-fueled frenzy.Why don't we go try fighting together?27835You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as dwarves go.I make sure that my two brothers here don't get into too much trouble.  They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me.  I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me!  Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!I can protect you, too.  Come on, let's go practice for a bit.  I'll make sure the enemies attack me, and not you.27836Slaying the foul creatures that plague the river will not be enough, .A new generation of these monstrosities already threatens to spawn within our holy waters.Seek their foul eggs and destroy them.27837Shortly after Uldum's protective barriers fell, the Vir'naal river became afflicted with a terrible corruption.Whether it was brought here maliciously or accidentally is not of great significance.The result is the same.  As the river becomes clouded so does our ability to peer into what the future holds for us.Look outside, .  These foul creatures were never meant to live in the pristine waters of our river.Slay them so that the river may grant us visions once again.27838You might have dealt with the symptoms of our problem, .  But I've been studying these foul beasts and the eggs are not laid here by them.The stream from the current carries their eggs to the dam, but whatever is laying them will be found upstream.Go northeast, to the river's main source, and deal with the root of the corruption.27839Though we aren't formally at war yet, the Neferset do not hesitate to imprison or kill all who trespass upon their territories.King Phaoris refuses to reciprocate, even when they use our lands to smuggle stolen relics from the tombs of our ancestors.My scouts report that the Neferset are about to move a major shipment of looted weapons south of here.I've instructed the laborers you recruited to assist you.  Call upon them with this horn when you find the smugglers and recover the weapons.27840The lost ones who live in the Fallow Sanctuary look as we look, but they are monsters... driven mad by the rigors of our journey to Azeroth.  Once our brethren, they now live in the Fallow Sanctuary to the west, catching or killing any who wander near.And they have stolen something sacred to us--draenethyst crystals.We lack the force to enter the Fallow Sanctuary and reclaim our stolen draenethyst from among their huts and campfires, but without those crystals... we too may lose our way.27841It's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it... I've already eaten everything they made for me!Might I trouble you for some more of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful...Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.27842I miss the days when legions of powerful ogres marched by the Horde's side into battle, the pathetic Alliance cowering at their ferocity. Perhaps those days will return before I am gone to the ancestors.However, that is not the case now. An ogre magi, Glubtok, has joined forces with the despicable Defias Brotherhood and acts as Foreman over their mining operations. The pathetic fool! End his life for me, and for the spirit and glory of the Horde!27843Just killing ogres won't be enough. The ogres themselves are being summoned onto the battlefield far too rapidly.I need you to go far behind the enemy line and seek out their summoners. The orcs are using warlocks to bring their reinforcements in.Cut down the warlocks, and the portals should close. There aren't many of them; a quick, surgical strike should cripple the enemy.27844The goblins you'll find working with the Defias are officially traitors to the Bilgewater Cartel, the Shattered Hand, and the Horde itself!I haven't yet been initiated into the Shattered Hand, so my loyalties lie strongly with my people. Helix Gearbreaker apparently has no time for such associations, and works on building a mast for the Defias Juggernaut. On behalf of Miss Mayhem and myself, would you kindly 'dispose' of Helix?27845We've taken more than we've lost, but we've still lost too much. Too many brave have given their lives for the Alliance out there. I want to make sure they're given proper honors no matter how fierce this battle gets.Take these flags out with you and place one on any fallen soldier you see. The protective wards on them won't offer much protection against any defilement, but it's better than nothing. I'll be able to better judge how many we've lost from a distance, as well.27846It's good to visit with friends and family again, though I may have overdone it... I've already eaten everything they made for me!Might I trouble you for some more of that delicious Bread of the Dead? I'd be most grateful...Chapman there sells the recipe, I think.27847These prototypes are going to change the face of Horde warfare when I perfect them! The issue I've been having is that their power sources don't allow for complicated combat maneuvers or large frames, both highly desired traits when it comes to fighting Alliance.The Defias, with some help from goblin traitors like Helix, have almost completed the Foe Reaper 5000, a massive golem that will actually work!We can't have that going public, can we? I'll lose customers!27848The Defias plan to finish their Juggernaut and use it to lay waste to Stormwind. It is a noble cause any true orc warrior would embrace without a single thought!Vanessa's fault lies in her execution of their plan. The ship is poorly constructed, the crew practically untrained, and, worst of all, there's a worgen in their midst!His name is Admiral Ripsnarl, and he must be mercilessly slain in the name of the Warchief. Lok'tar ogar!27849This is it, . We've made our final push into Stonard itself.I shouldn't have to remind anyone, but I'll say it anyway: We're not orcs, and we're not going to become them out of revenge or spite. Stonard will not be burned to the ground for us to dance on the ashes.No, I want this done right. I want this surgical. Hold your head high and strike down any orc that picks up a weapon.27850The Shattered Hand has laid mostly quiet for years now.No more!You will be the instrument of our rebirth, . Slay the Defias Kingpin and commandeer her ship for the Horde! We will outfit it as a proper orc warship and use it to finally lay waste to StormwindAny survivors will spread word of our unstoppable power across all of Azeroth, and all will tremble before our might!Go now, VanCleef's death will be your greatest triumph yet hero.27851We may not be flattening Stonard into dust, but I don't want to have to go in there a second time.I want you to gather any supplies you see in the town while you're there. Without food, they won't have any fighters after more than a day.There should be crates scattered all over town.27852War rages in the swamp, . Vicious humans have settled north of the city and brought an army to our doorstep.There is nothing in this swamp for them. Their sole reason for coming here is to attack us, unprovoked. We will not give them the pleasure of victory!We are undermanned and I need every able orc to take to the battlefield. Go, and slay as many humans as you can.27853We are outnumbered by the Alliance. In their fear they send an army to crush a single settlement. But we will not give!Without resources, their soldiers will be at a disadvantage. Human peasants busy themselves in the woods outside Marshtide Watch, gathering lumber to rebuild their crumbling walls.Deny them the wood, and their lives.27854We have suffered many losses, . Dreadmaul Hold has sent ogres from the Blasted Lands as reinforcements, but they can only send so many; the Alliance attacks them as well, even as we speak.The Alliance has countered our ogres with mounted knights, a strategy that served them well in the Second War. We will need our strongest warriors to turn the tide of battle!Return to the Bloodmire, , and bring down those knights!27855The Alliance has brought in their mages to summon more reinforcements directly to the battlefield from beyond their fortress. This must be stopped!Their numbers are few, but a single portal can turn the tide of battle. Attack their mages and shut off those portals!27856Many warriors have met death to bring us victory, . The fate of a true orc.I have seen the way the Alliance loots the bodies of our fallen, clutching at our goods like packrats. They will not defile our fallen heroes on this field.Take these wards with you to the Bloodmire. Place them on the bodies of our fallen warriors. I will be watching, to see how many have fallen, and to honor their sacrifice. Let us hope the spirits give us aid for our respect.27857The Alliance are at our walls!Your actions delayed them and weakened their forces, , but in the end we are outnumbered. This is our last stand. Victory or death...Fight with honor, . They are within the walls as we speak. Drive the human dogs from Stonard, for the Horde!27858Wait here.  I will retrieve the egg.2785927860When the Dark Portal closed many years ago, regret and fear seized many of us who had come to these lands. In their despair, they cursed the name of the Light, and sank into violence and hatred.These fallen souls are now the Lost Ones, little more than mindless monsters, attacking all who approach. They grow more corrupt by the day, and as they die off, they have begun to kidnap from the Harborage..They are beyond help, . Their suffering must end. Will you put them from their misery?27861I was wondering when you'd show up, ! Having a past champion of the Ring of Blood here will be a huge draw! We're gonna be rich, buddy! RICH!Anyway, this is some old Dragonmaw fighting pit. Didn't take much modification to tune it up to our uses. I put out a few feelers, and got some heavy hitters from all around Azeroth to join in the carnage. Bout time to make some gold!You know the drill, . When you're ready, let me know and we'll get this show on the road!27862Well well, if it isn't the once champion of anguish, ! I'm seeing good money in the future now that you're here! We're gonna be rollin in the dough, buddy! Filthy RICH!Anyway, this is some old Dragonmaw fighting pit. Didn't take much modification to tune it up to our uses.

When you're ready, let me know and we'll get this show on the road!27863I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand or the bloodbowl in Zul'Drak, but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Twi-Hi, pal.You're new to this pit, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match.If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?27864You're going to love this one! The Dragonmaw heard you were entering the arena and they're determined to make sure you don't leave it.Time for some good ol'  on orc action! Let me know when you're ready to do this!27865You're going to love this one! The Wildhammer heard you were entering the arena and they're determined to make sure you don't leave it.Time for some good ol'  on dwarf action! Let me know when you're ready to do this!27866Grim and gory, this next match is sure to have the crowd groanin' one way or another. Calder Gray has been gathering the bodyparts of defeated challengers and building the perfect champion.This thing is the ultimate cobbled collaboration of corpsified combatants. A magnificent mashup of mangled monstrosities. Are you ready to get messy?! Cause I am! Let me know when you're ready so we can get this thing started!27867You're going to have your hands full with this one, pal. We've got a seasoned gentleman warrior here! He hails from Gilneas, and he's out to prove that he's the best warrior this side of Azeroth.You better pull up those boots and zip up those pants, because it's going to get downright feral up in here. Give me the word when you're down for some punishment.27868We've got someone you'll really love to hate this time around. I wasn't sure at first if I should let him into the pit, but a fight's a fight! And who am I to turn down some guaranteed cash?!This guy hails from the Twilight Citadel itself, and comes toting a toasty punch. Better move fast and watch your back! Just give me the word when you're ready for some action.27869These serpents must be from the Temple of Atal'Hakkar. I already had a hint...Not a few days ago, I had a visitor stop by and ask me to keep an eye out for such things. An elf by the name of Itharius. I'm sure he didn't think I could see through his form... he was a green dragon in disguise, come here to help his fallen brothers no doubt.He may very well be on to something. Itharius left for the temple itself. Perhaps you'd better go look for him there. Dark things are afoot.27870Regardless of whether you assist me within the temple, your people must be told of what is brewing here.North of the temple, humans of your mortal Alliance have built what they call Marshtide Watch. They war with the Horde across the swamp, a raging conflict that I forsee only worsening.It is not my role to interfere in mortal affairs, . I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple.27871Regardless of whether you assist me within the temple, your people must be told of what is brewing here.Southwest of the temple is the Horde town of Stonard. The orcs there wage war with the new human arrivals to the swamp, a raging conflict that I forsee only worsening.It is not my role to interfere in mortal affairs, . I simply ask you bring warning to your people of what lurks within the temple.27874Your expertise is needed elsewhere, .Just southwest of the World Tree you will find the Shrine of Aviana, home to the Druids of the Talon. Aviana, the matron of all winged creatures, gave her life for this world ten thousand years ago.I sense her shrine is being threatened, as are the druids who guard it. Seek out Choluna, one of the wisest of the winged druids, deep within the shrine.27875I have worked for years to try to cure the affliction of the Broken. The foul energies that corrupted them did  more than twist their bodies; it took the comfort of the Light from them. They cannot feel its warmth.I cannot let Magtoor pass on in darkness, . Before he worsened, I was studying prayerblossom, a flower that grows in the shifting mire. It grows hardy in even the darkest shade. I beg of you, gather these flowers for me, for Magtoor's sake.27876The Shifting Mire takes its name from a unique phenomenon. By some force, the extremely fine silt will collect, and move on its own accord, travelling as if alive.I originally worried this was some corruptive force, but my studies have shown the opposite; whatever energy invigorates this soil is positive in nature. Perhaps such vibrant life can be imparted onto the Broken to reawaken what they once were.The silt may not take kindly to being collected, . But please, help gather it.27877I need your help in a little project I'm working on, .  It falls into a realm I like to call \"defensive archaeology\".I like to bury non-magical items in conspicuous places to fool those Alliance idiots into thinking they've found something valuable.Hmm... Dark Iron dwarves wander Hammertoe's Digsite and Angor Fortress, to the north.  Bring their heads back to me.  Yes, that's right, their heads.Once the flesh is stripped, we can use those skulls to interfere with the dwarves' work.27878I've got a little proposition for you, if you're interested.The Dark Iron dwarves were here long before we arrived.  That means that, once these titan ruins opened up, the Dark Irons were the first ones in there, looting all the choice items.  I'll bet they've still got those treasures locked up inside Angor Fortress, northwest of here.I want you to find such a treasure... then steal it.27879We're hard-up for supplies, stranger.  With the black dragons raining destruction on our hunting grounds, we have no way to get food.The ogres to our south, however, have exactly what we need.  Within their grotto you should find plenty of meat and crafting supplies.They may put up a fight.  Be on your guard.27880My grunts have got this dragon problem under control.  Besides, I can't have an upstart  like you barging in and ruining our battle plans.You want work?  Fine, I'll give you work.  Investigate the ogre camp to our southwest.  From what I've heard, a small army of combatants seems to have appeared outside of their hovel.We can't sit and wait for them to flank us, soldier... especially while we're already embroiled with black dragons.  Thin their ranks before they thin ours.27881I've got an idea, but it's a bit of a long shot.  Thankfully, long shots happen to be a specialty of mine.North of here, the Reliquary has uncovered a new set of titan ruins beneath the sands.  If there's anything older and wiser than dragons, it's titans.  Heck, I've heard rumors that the titans CREATED the dragons.Talk to High Examiner Tae'thelan Bloodwatcher at their camp to the northeast.  He'll have more information than I do about these titans.What did I tell you?  It's a long shot.27882The Explorers' League may have a yeoman's knowledge of the actual act of digging.  What they lack, however, is the good sense to USE the artifacts that they dig up.  They stow their treasures in stagnant museums instead of using these items of power for their true purpose.The dwarves are fools.  Fortunately, they die easily.You'll find them digging into canyon walls north of here.  Take whatever you can out of their stubby-fingered hands, then return it to me.27883One of the few items of worth that we managed to loot from these ruins is this small jade statue.We believe it to be a key of some sort, but we're unable to determine what it opens.  As such, it is useless to me.Perhaps you'll have some better luck with it.27884We found this small red statue on the corpse of one of those Explorers' League archaeologists.  Sadly, it wasn't us who killed him.  The local wildlife had already taken care of that.The statue is well-crafted, but apparently bereft of magical power.  You may use it for whatever means you deem necessary.27885You see the statue split into two, then four, then eight identical statues in a square formation.You hear a voice, not through your ears, but in the back of your mind:   \"A true warden does not face OUTWARD, searching for signs of danger.  A true warden keeps his gaze INWARD, always focused on protecting his quarry.\"Perhaps this is a riddle of some sort?27886As you place the statue in its place, several other stone statues appear in the room.  One more ruby-colored statue also appears, in a small enclosure on the far end of the room.  You hear a voice:  \"The Sentinel watches.  The Sentinel protects.   The Sentinel's vision never falters.\"That red statue on the other side of the room looks important.  Perhaps you should try to connect the two red statues?27887You heard a good amount of rumbling happen in the tomb's central chamber.  Those two large statues did look awfully suspicious.27888Inside the chest, you find a small, circular device, resting upon a cushion.If there are any titan artifacts to be found here in the tomb, this is it.  You resolve to bring it back to Dr. Blam.27889D... did you see that?  Incredible!  My titan thing idea worked!  With your help, of course.We'll want to get these back to Rhea.  She's not at Lethlor Ravine anymore; it sounds like she blew her cover when she transformed into her true form in front of all those whelps.  She's now in the west, staying at a large Horde establishment dubbed \"New Kargath\".She'll be waiting for you.  And for that egg.27890In my haste to escape from Lethlor Ravine, I forgot to tie up one loose end: Nyxondra.  She's free, and she's sounded the alarm among the black dragonflight.  Half the flight is here in the western Badlands, combing for this egg.I'll take care of hiding the egg.  You're going to take care of some of the more troublesome dragons.  And you'll have help.I've paid off a couple of mercenaries to help you.  You'll find them inside this inn.27891Before we get too crazy with the dragon-killing, let me tell you a little bit about how I fight.I'm not terribly strong or stalwart like these other two, but I've got a few tricks.  At your command I'll stun your enemies to keep 'em held still.  I also make sure to keep a few potions around for tight spots.Why don't we practice fighting together?  Head out into the field, and you can see what it's like to fight with a real orc.27892Oh, you want to talk?  Fine.I'm Jurrix, the only merc here with half a brain.  The only one with any bite to my attacks, too.  The only reason I keep these meat shields around is to keep myself from getting killed.Listen, you're the boss of this operation.  You give the word, and I'll send a fireball right through your target's heart.  If things start getting hectic, I can even warp time a bit so you can fit in a few extra attacks.Why don't we go try fighting together?27893You may not have noticed, but I'm pretty big, as far as orcs go.I make sure that my two pals here don't get into too much trouble.  They're small, and they don't have a big shield like me.  I'm big, and I can handle a few monsters hitting me!  Plus, if I'm careful, I can usually get them to hit my shield instead!I can protect you, too.  Come on, let's go practice for a bit.

I will retrieve the egg.27899If you're looking for Harrison, you just missed him.He was going on and on about his latest discovery, and how everything was beginning to make sense.Whatever... he certainly wasn't making sense to me.I tried to convince him to stay here and just enjoy a few desert sunsets with me, but there's no talking to him when he gets that gleam in his eye.Perhaps you'd be willing to check in on him?He was headed to that big monolith, south of here.27900Good timing, .Seems I'm not the only one interested in these obelisks, and these fellas aren't inclined to compare notes...I think I can handle this guy.Maybe you could take care of a few of his friends before they make their way over here?27901Listen, . I don't have a lot of time to talk here.These guys are excavating relics from this site and taking pieces of ancient technology that we need!I need you to check their crates for pieces of an ancient activation device. The officers should have the codes you'll need to open them.Hurry!We can't let them load this stuff into their planes!27902Magtoor has told me of the shamanism that the Broken practice. The great Nobundo once said that the path of the elements may, in a way, be another way to the Light.I can only hope there is some truth in this. The elementals that gather near Purespring Cavern to the south are a source of truly pristine water. They can be chaotic and violent, but the pure water harvested from them will be the perfect conduit for the blessing of the Light.Please, bring me this water, .27903This guy just won't go down!You're doin' great, kid. Only one thing left to do.According to my research, there should be a titan statue down below. Use the device to activate it, then break it down.If my theory is correct, that statue holds the key to reactivating this obelisk.27904The Grell are forest spirits that wander the Misty Valley to the east. Though they resemble imps, I have found no demonic traces among the ones I've studied. They are, as far as I can tell, uncorrupted. Those that dwell in the valley move as one with the wind, summoning gusts of breeze at their whim. This pure air may be incorporated into my remedy for poor Magtoor.Please, , gather the smoky crystals found within the grells' bodies for me. I must exhaust every potential cure.27905Okay, I've softened this guy up, how about you help me finish him off?I've got a plan for our escape, but it'll require a lot of guts and a little luck.You up for it, ?Just follow my lead...27906There is much work to do in recovering from the assault and bracing ourselves for the next one.

Assist her in any way she requires.27907I have been ruined, . I placed my strength in Helgrum, and now it bleeds from his gaping wounds. Wounds too deep to heal, flesh that refuses to knit.He murmurs in fear, consumed by fever and pain. I cannot leave his side. Not now. Please, I ask you in shame to gather herbs for me.The prayerblossom that grows in the swamp is an old remedy for soothing. With enough of it, his pain might be stilled.27908Helgrum's wounds fester in the swamp air. They swell and ooze, filling his final moments with suffering. I must have something to coat them with.The spirits move through this mire. They inhabit the mud itself, pushing it along in clumps of fine soil that take on lives of their ownThe spirits of the cool, pure mud will offer him some comfort. Please, gather it for me, for I cannot abandon his side.27909Helgrum's breathing slows. His time is near.I need water. Elementals roam the ponds of Purespring Cavern. The water that flows from them is the purest in this swamp.Even if I could risk leaving Helgrum's side, my axe would shudder in my hand. I must beg you once again to pity me, for his comfort. Bring me the motes of the elementals, that his final drink may be pure and refreshing.27910If I am reduced to groveling, I may as well ask everything I can. There is one last favor I would ask of you, one more task a shamed orc pleads for.Helgrum had a prized prey. Duskfang, eater of ogres, the great panther of Misty Valley. He would never allow himself the leisure of stalking it. Though he wanted badly to hunt, our scouting duties were too important.If he cannot hunt Duskfang in this world, he can hunt the beast in the next.

I will hasten your return by pulling your spirit to me through the Emerald Dream.This may cause slight drowsiness.27915I must confess I have a more personal involvement in this affair. One of the first of the green dragons corrupted here was my brother, Eranikus.I thought Eranikus gone, lost forever to the darkest rifts of nightmare, but I have heard that his shade has emerged within the temple. I know not whether it is truly him, or an empty, mournful echo.If you wish to help me further, return to the Hall of Masks and journey through the archway into the true sanctum of the temple. I will find you there.27916Here is Ruag's report, . Let him know his scout is still here.Do not speak of Helgrum. I will not distract others with news of tragedy.I have to be strong. We all have to be strong.27917I could smell Godfrey and his companions a mile away from here. They did an exceedingly poor job covering their tracks in flight. It will be the mistake that puts the final nail in their coffins.One of them is very close, and though the scent has changed slightly in undeath, I'm fairly certain it's Ashbury's. Go inside and tear him to pieces, we'll ensure the Forsaken do not intervene with our task.27918Anchorite Avuun is one of our uncorrupted bretheren, what other races know as Draenei. He came to The Harborage to heal us, and try to find a cure. It is he who sent me here to collect these crystals.He watches over a very sick friend now... and despite sending word to the Exodar itself, he has not found any aid so far. Could you bring these crystals to him, ? You may be the only one able to assist him.27919We appreciate your assistance here in this swamp, .  I would like to inform you that I have received correspondence from Nethergarde Keep.Enohar Thunderbrew has requested help in investigating the shipwrecks of the Red Reaches, but we have had none willing to make the journey, and I could not leave the Harborage.Nethergarde Keep sits in the Blasted Lands, south of the Swamp of Sorrows.  Do not journey too close to Stonard on your way.27920We've hit an unexpected snag in our assault on the keep, . It seems the servants that tended to Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale in life do so now in death as well, and Godfrey has placed them directly between us and him.Not to worry, we won't let them be anything more than a minor inconvenience. Eliminate Silverlaine and Springvale both and not only will their guards no longer have masters to direct them, it will place us that much closer to our final goal.27921It appears that Lord Walden has finally taken notice to our presence and has heightened his defenses. It's worthless really... nothing will deter our pack.The path ahead to him is rife with powerful Scourge minions, but I trust that you will be able to clear the path for the rest of us to follow in. Once we kill Walden, it should be a straight shot to his cowardly leader.27922Please, stranger.  You must help me.I came here to investigate the arrival of a powerful ally to the Neferset, only to be betrayed by my closest allies and given up to the enemy.Go to the terrace above us to the east and find the information I failed to uncover.  You'll need to hide from the Neferset.  Perhaps you can hide behind one of the large plants on the platform to conceal your presence.Do this for me and I will help your friends find their way to safety.27923I'm not sure what knuckle-headed plan your friend is concocting, but we're going to need a distraction if we're to stand a chance of escaping.Take the torch from that brazier and go start some fires.Perhaps if we divert the Neferset scum's attention away for a few minutes, we'll have the opportunity we need.27924I've an idea!

I forget their names... the dwarf was Theldurin, I think?  Anyhow, they headed south with a pack full of ale a couple of days ago, and haven't been heard from since.  I think they were headed to that big scar.Would you mind checking in on them?  I'd like to make sure that they're alright.27928The commander can be most generous to those who demonstrate their loyalty, and I know of something that you can do to curry favor with him.Before building up his... ehh... workforce, he dealt in the furs of animals.He is quite skilled in the art of leatherworking.

The elementals and giants upon the Quaking Fields are being mustered.They too are after the middle fragment of the World Pillar.

However, to get you to him quickly and safely, I'm going to need to perform a ritual.Go out into the field and collect elemental ore from the ragers. With enough of it, I should be able to make you one with the ground to get you where you need to go.27934The leader of the Stone Mother's forces here is the great earth elemental lord, Avalanchion. Luckily for us, the Twilight's Hammer cultists have decided to invade his lair. They're seeking to bind his elementals to their will.We will take advantage of the chaos.

The bad part of this story is that the silk comes from the glands on Broodmother spiders.  I need you to gather 4 of these for me.That should be just enough to finish up this last set of shirts.27949Many soldiers died on this island .  It is only fair that we pay our respects to them in any way that we can.I need you to travel to Forgotten Hill, due west of here and release our brothers in arms' tortured souls away from this place.

I was beginning to enjoy his company.Oh well, back to work!I'm the closest thing that this expedition has to a medical officer, and I'm running low on antivenom.  We tend to need a lot of antivenom.The key to a proper antivenom is ALWAYS to start with the poison itself.  The glassweb spiders nearby should be a good place to start.  If you kill them, you can probably extract some venom from the sacs within their jaws.27959Lunk sees you like to kill things.  Let Lunk teach you another way.Lunk always wanted to ride on spider's back.  Looks like fun.  Spiders move too fast, though.  Always slip away.We work together.

And Lunk... well, you'd think he'd be a big fighter, but he's the biggest wimp of all of us.What I'm saying is, it's good that you came here when you did.It seems likely that we in the Thorium Brotherhood are going to be fighting the other Dark Iron dwarves soon.  I'm thinking we should pick off some of their finest before the war starts in earnest.  Start with the geologists and watchmen to the south.27961The gorge is an unforgiving place.  We don't get a whole lot of fuzzy wildlife wandering around here.We tried bringing in some wild game, but they haven't fared well at all.  There's just no food for them to eat.  Now the nearby spiders - which were already dangerous - are getting big and fat on chicken meat.We'll never get rid of all the spiders, but we can salvage what few chickens remain.  Not only will you be feeding the Brotherhood, you'll be saving them a painful death by spider bite.27962Margol the Rager's an old thunder lizard seen round these parts.  Legend has it that he's been here in the gorge since before it was even a gorge.  Legend also has it that he ate my brother Barnabas.I don't care how old he is or what kind of magic he shoots out of his nose.  I just want him dead.  For Barnabas' sake.You'll find him wandering the cliffs to the south of here.27963You've arrived just in time.Here's the skinny: the Dark Iron dwarves in the gorge have been acting strangely, and the Thorium Brotherhood intends to find out why.  Overseer Oilfist doesn't like surprises.We suspect that they're following orders from some new leader.  I have reason to believe that Gravius Grimesilt, just south of here, knows who it is.Even here in Searing Gorge, we've begun to hear tales of your exploits, .  You should have no problem with Grimesilt.27964Grimesilt wasn't as high up on the chain as I thought.  We'll have to take out his superior and find out what he knows.Dig-Boss Dinwhisker's his name, and he runs the Dark Iron digging operations within the Cauldron, just northwest of here.  His excavators and footmen patrol the eastern side of the Cauldron, digging downward, day and night.He's not known to show his face out in the field very often, but if you slay enough of his men, he'll be forced to come out and deal with you.27965Did... did you see that?  This is the missing piece we've been looking for!  We have to take this information back to someone at Thorium Point.The Dark Irons have been known to consort with the firelord in the past, but never before have they brought their kind this far out into Searing Gorge.Thorium Point is west and north of here.  You will find it nestled in the cliffs that overlook Pyrox Flats.  Take this information straight to Overseer Oilfist.27966Forgotten Hill has been overrun with zombies and ghouls ever since we reclaimed this wretched isle.  We have tried to clear them out many times but they always seem to come back.One of our lieutenants recommended taking the ghouls' bones when we kill them in hopes that they can't reincarnate overnight.  Think you can help us out with this one?27967The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in the Stormwind stockades.  None of us could believe he ended up here on Tol Barad.  Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale.I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours.27968Ah, the sweet scent of victory!

Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there.To make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors.  We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back.  Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to.  You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline.Oh, and I hope you are not too scared of sharks.27971We have been having issues with the undead down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now.  Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks.Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there?  I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point.Keep an eye out for horde, we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately.27972Morale is low these days, .  We make every effort we can to keep the troops in high spirits but we are running low on our main supply of morale booster... rum.I have been getting reports from our infantry to the south that the shipwrecks on the Cape of Lost Hope still have a good supply of southsea rum in their wrecked hulls.  Can you head up there and investigate?Bring back any rum you can find.27973Have you been over to the Wellson Shipyard yet, ?  Best to stay away from there unless you have a good reason to venture in.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what I need you to do.You see, we have been short on supplies ever since we recaptured the island.  That ghost ridden shipyard is overflowing with lumber but every time we send an escort to recover the lumber, they never make it back.Can you help us out?27974Did you think that a handful of worgen vermin could stop me? Hah!Shadowfang Keep was part of the Lordaeron kingdom in life, so it is quite fitting that it should belong to the Forsaken in death. Godfrey and his accomplices are minor obstacles at best, and of course we're all happy to take them out for their treachery against the Dark Lady.Ashbury has positioned himself near the front of the keep, leaving him wide open to attack. Start us out on the right foot, would you?27975Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here.  His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them.He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard.  I need you to take out Wellson for good this time.  Be careful , we have been receiving reports of filthy Horde all around the area.27976Unfortunately, I can't dish out the beats like I used to, due to this here fat finger problem.

Get crackin'.27977We used to have more stuff around here.  I think there was a spyglass somewhere nearby, along with a smithing tuyere.I'm pretty certain that they've been stolen by Dark Iron dwarves.  Yes, I know that I'm a Dark Iron dwarf!  I'm talking about the bad ones that live down in that gorge.You'd best check the steamsmiths that work just south of here.  They'd be most likely to use tools like these.27978See that hill just beyond our base camp?  That's Largo's Overlook and it's not a fun place to setup camp next to.  We have been dealing with those spirits and spectres ever since we setup base camp.Can you head up there and let them know we don't plan on leaving anytime soon?  A few good kills on their ranks should put them in line.Thanks for your help on this, .27979I got one more assignment for ye.  This one comes straight down from the Overseer himself.  Seems he was pretty shook up once he heard about that \"Archduke\" ye discovered.He's asked for us to hunt down three Twilight ministers that work over in Firewatch Ridge, to the west.  Kiyuubi, Letherio, and Finister are their names, and they each carry some sort o' special rock.  Combine all three and bring 'em back here.Listen, when the Overseer gives orders, ye don't ask questions.  Ye just do it.27980Normal-size spiders, I can handle.Giant glassweb spiders make me uncomfortable, but they're far enough away that I don't worry too much.But lava spiders?    Lava spiders are SCARY.  They're enormous spiders.  That live in LAVA.I just got paid for my last week of work, and I'll pay you well to kill those things.  You'll find 'em all over Searing Gorge.27981We smith, we smelt, we roast up whatever spider meat we can get.  Bush chicken if we're lucky.  Point is, all o' this work means we need lots and lots of fire.Good thing we're smack dab in the middle of firetown.O' course, the best fire comes from the elementals.  You'll find 'em all over Searing Gorge, but always near lava.  Here, take these flasks and use 'em on the elementals.Oh, did I mention the elementals gotta be alive when you gather your sample?27982Have ye seen the ridiculous necklaces those Twilight's Hammer cultists all wear?  The gems on those things are bigger than Hansel's fist!A few hamburger-sized jewels like that, and Burninate over there could really push his blacksmithing business to the next level.

Lunk have a better way.Listen: you go fight dwarf, but do not kill!  Just fight until dwarf get tired.  Then Lunk will help dwarf fall asleep.  Dwarfs probably just cranky because they don't get sleep.Come on!  Trust Lunk.27984Will you assist me, mortal? Hear my tale.27985Will you assist me, mortal?  Will you find the prayer to Elune?As I stated, the prayer was etched onto a golden tablet.  I believe they hold it within one of their vile chests, near the entrance to their cave at the bottom of the ridge.If you do recover my prayer, don't bring it back to me.  Instead, take the time to read through it.Absolution may be asking too much, based on the sins I've committed.  But that won't stop me from holding out hope.27986The Thorium Brotherhood doesn't maintain a militia - just a few guards, and me, and that's it.  If we're to successfully strike against the Dark Irons of the gorge, we're gonna need help.Mountain-Lord Rendan sits atop that tower across the gorge, to our south.  He doesn't consort with Twilight folks or fire elementals, but he hasn't joined the brotherhood either.  Maybe it's time we paid him a visit.  With his help, we might just stand a chance.27987Largo and his minions have been stealing our supplies ever since we setup camp here.  It's frustrating to say the least.We have heard reports that he is stockpiling cannonballs in the towers overlooking the water up on his overlook.  Can you head up there and try to recover some of them for us?, don't forget to keep a watch out for horde too.27988The best part about this plague is that even when it visually fades away, the remaining residue is still quite potent! However, we still have an enormous area to cover before we're done, with plenty of Godfrey's defenses in the way.It appears that the spirits that served Baron Silverlaine and Commander Springvale in life now guard them in death, and Godfrey is using them to deter us. Show them all the iron will of the Forsaken!27989Ruumbo hungers!The Deadwood jerks have stolen all their honey from the Timbermaw tribe! We saw...er, Ruumbo saw them do it! Now Ruumbo must have that honey!Take this... this stick! Yes, this stick.

Largo is pretty paranoid these days so you should be able to find him on top of the tower, looking for his imaginary navy to finally arrive.27992Getting useful machine parts out here on the island has been difficult, .  We have been trying to repair the broken siege engines here in camp but we keep running out of useful parts.Our second regiment reported some wrecked out siege engines in a old battlefield to the west.  Maybe we could find some parts over there?You are going to have trouble finding anything in that old battlefield so take this magnetized scrap collector and put it to some good use.27993We was lucky to escape, . I'm not sure I'd feel right if we didn't take care of them ambushers.Hows about you git back up to Khartut's tomb and give them little buggers what fer!It's off to the northeast, just inside the entrance to Uldum if'n I recollect correctly.What're you looking at?

Dance!27996Unsurprisingly, we aren't going to listen to Cromush about the plague. However, his brute strength will come in handy for muscling my men through the many foes ahead on the path to Godfrey, the most powerful being his right hand man, Lord Walden.I'll meet you in Walden's chamber after you finish him off. Then, at long last, we can completely take Shadowfang Keep for the Forsaken!27997The cleansing of this forest has been a grueling process. For every success we have achieved, a new challenge has arisen.The Jadefire satyr have been a constant nuisance. They seek to corrupt the forest just as we seek to cleanse it. Now, we have taken steps to begin eradicating them from Felwood entirely.Travel to Jadefire Glen to the west and rid the forest of their presence. You'll find the entrance just north of the walls of Deadwood Village; look for their vile banners.27998If all goes well you'll just be able to walk right into Godfrey's personal domain and take a reward fitting for such an eager young .Godfrey is a cunning foe, though, so it may be wise to head up there quickly just in case you're needed. He will pay for what he did to the Dark Lady!27999It seems the Doyles already joined their last fight. Iain will want to know of their fate.28000The satyr hide their corrupted moonwell behind an impenetrable barrier of demonic fire. Their forces must have some way of getting through it.Interrogating the satyr will be useless, but the imps they consort with will be easily swayed. I have a specific one in mind, as well...In the foothills to the east, a lone imp has been seen wandering, far from the other demons. He should prove easy pickings. Weaken him with combat, and then use this enchanted sack to capture him. Then I'll do the talking...28001We may be safe here, but there are a lot of Wildhammer who could still use support. Our wing can offer that, but we need to keep bolsterin' our forces if we're going to clear the Twilight completely.I'm going to have words with Colin Thundermar. Only a coward turns down the callin' of his people, especially in a time this dire.Go to Thundermar, find Colin and get a real explanation out of'm. I won't be putting up with cowardice in a Wildhammer leader.28002There is a delicate situation that calls for the... objective discretion of an outsider.You see, an unfortunate incident has upset some of our guests. Rest assured, our top men are sorting out the details.In the meantime, it would be wonderful if you could calm our more squeamish visitors.Handle this well, and the furrier is sure to hear of it!28028That Overseer Oilfist couldn't'a picked a worse time to ask me to join a fight.  My summit's already under siege!It's nothin' my guards can't handle, but still, it won't be easy for me to just pick up and send some dwarves into that infernal gorge.Tell ya what: you take out their marksmen that're holding our fortress under siege, and I'll consider your offer.  Ye'll find 'em slinkin' around the flats to the east.28029I'm not sure if ye've noticed, but my tower's much taller than any o' the other towers here around the Gorge.  Some dwarves pride themselves at how deep they can dig, but not me.  Sometimes I think I shoulda been born a Wildhammer.I still don't like the sight o' those other towers, though.  Reachin' up like that, ticklin' my tower's feet.  Here, take this torch, an' use it on the braziers atop those other towers.  They'll be sorry they ever built 'em to begin with.28030Those gorge-digging dwarves do at least one thing right: they make very high-quality bullets.  I've been unable to reproduce their results, so I've taken to stealing whatever bullets of theirs that I can find.Ye want my help?  Get me a couple hundred bullets from those marksmen below.I'm sure they'll be happy to give ye their bullets one at a time, but you might find it faster just to look for the crates filled with them.28031I have a new business partner, my best buddy, Brivelthwerp. Even as we speak, he's building up the infrastructure for our new ice cream empire!He took our coolant tug, inventory, and employees southwest to the Sunken Dig Site. Unfortunately, I don't currently have a way to deliver something to him... something extremely important: our super-secret I-Scream Cryocannon!You don't mind taking it to him, do you, ?28032There's so much we don't know about the incendosaurs.  Where did they come from?  How do they survive out here on the flats?  And why do they taste so bad?The key to understanding these prehistoric beasts, I believe, starts with the fire-gizzard.  Every incendosaur has one.  I'd like a few of them to study.You'll find incendosaurs circling the foot of Iron Summit, mostly to the west.28033What?  Why're you still here?  Oh, did I promise that I'd help you and the Thorium Brotherhood in yer fight?I lied.I just can't spare the men right now.  I know I said I'd help, but there's absolutely no way you can convince me to leave Iron Summit right now.  Absolutely no way.28034Lunk not smart, but Lunk notice things.  Today, Lunk notice that Mountain-Dwarf likes to watch people dance.Lunk like to dance!   like to dance!  Probably!Maybe we find some more dwarfs that like to dance.  Then we go talk to Mountain-Dwarf, and he will listen to .28035Alright, alright!  If I knew ye could dance like that, I wouldn't'a asked ye to do all that stuff earlier.Tell Overseer Oilfist that I'll be joinin' ye.  I'll meet ye in the slag pit, !  With the combined forces of Thorium Point and Iron Summit, those gorge-dwarves won't know what hit 'em!28038You've got some fight in you, . You might do well in the crucible.What!? You haven't heard of the Crucible of Carnage? That smarmy goblin Gurgthock and his troll sidekick have been plastering us with leaflets ever since he set up shop here in the Highlands. Champions from all over Azeroth fight to the death in there. You should gather up some friends and see how you fare.The Crucible is just to the southwest. Look for Wodin the Troll-Servant somewhere in the middle of a ring of bones.28041You can hold your own on the ground, . I'll give you that.But we Dragonmaw dominate the skies as well as land. Until you can prove to me you can handle a drake as well as a Dragonmaw, your Horde is nothing to me.Let's see if you can wrangle one back to Bloodgulch.First you'll need bait. Go out and kill one of the gryphons that wander the woods west or northeast of here. Make sure it's untamed! Drakes hate the stink of dwarf on their food.Get the gryphon carcass and you'll know what to do.28042I recently came into possession of something that needs to be delivered to a gnome that goes by the name, Brivelthwerp. It's more like Briveltwerp if you ask me.I want you to take it to him in the southwest, down at the Sunken Dig Site. He's up to something and there's moolah involved... I can smell it!Keep an eye on what he's doing, , and see if you can't get a cut of his profits. A big cut!2804328044I've added a drop of my very own essence to the ooze. Look for a glowing sigil to the west, at the edge of Shadowlurk Ridge. Stand on it, concentrate, and pour this stuff all over yourself. It should be enough to shift you into the nether and let you see what's REALLY there.You won't be alone... the satyr's treasure is being guarded by the biggest voidstalker they could summon. Defeat him, and the treasure is yours.And come back in one piece, or this crazy broad's gonna fry me!28045Below us is a cave. It's huge! The perfect location for our new refrigerated vault. It's big enough to hold all of our inventory with room to grow.Unfortunately, when we were almost done equipping all of the pipes, bugs burrowed up out of nowhere and killed all of my employees!How was I supposed to know?But it gave me a great idea: silithid-flavored ice cream. We'll make a killing!All I need now are the ingredients.28046We have been trying to collect useful scraps from the front all week.  Every time we gather a batch to bring back to camp, we get assaulted by the restless infantry in the area.  Can you head over there and clear them out?28047It's time to break out the I-Scream Cryocannon!We lifted the tech from the frost cannons on the river boats. If it's one thing that we gnomes are good at, it's miniaturization by way of making everything else that much bigger!I need you to take the cannon down there into the cave and freeze the pipes we setup in the walls. That'll jumpstart them.28048There's some kind of smart brain bug in the back of the cave. It's in charge of all of the silithid down there.My ice cream is melting! How am I supposed to launch my ice cream empire, and save my inventory, if that thing's in there?!28049Yeah, yeah, your stuck-up mage friend there hit it on the nose. The imps over at Shadowlurk Ridge are hiding the key to the satyr's barrier in the nether. It's right there, but you can't see it or touch it unless you're shifted.I guess you're out of luck though, because only imps can phase shift! So you should just close your eyes, turn around, and let me go...It was just a joke! Don't hurt me! I'll need slime from the cursed oozes around these ruins. Bring me enough to cover you from head to toe!28050I hate sharks.  All of my troops hate sharks too.  This is where you come in, .I need you to head up to the Cape of Lost Hope and take out a huge shark named Tank.  Tank is not to be trifled with so I would bring a few friends if I were you.28051Don't get me wrong... I'm cheerful on the outside, but inside I'm just terribly torn to pieces. All of my friends and employees are dead.Could you do me a favor? Would you swim down there and attach the tug's tow hook to my dead employees? I'll reel them in.28052I'm putting you on a flying machine, .You'll be responsible for softening our landing into the slag pit.  Speak with your flight master here in Thorium Point, then fly down to the gorge.Once you near your landing point, there will undoubtedly be hordes of Dark Iron dwarves waiting for you.  Use our flying machine's guns to take out as many of them as you can, then land at the cavern's entrance.  Rendan should be waiting for you by the time you arrive.2805328054Much like Overseer Maltorius, I'm a rich dwarf.  However, I earned my riches through hard work and wise decisions, not through slavery.OK fine, very little slavery.  Hardly any.Anyhow, the first thing that I see inside these caverns are slavedrivers and taskmasters.  I won't stand for this!  As you progress through the cavern, kill as many as you can.  Report your results to Evonice Sootsmoker, deeper within the Slag Pit.28055Of course, we'll want to free as many slaves as we can while we're here.  Most of them will likely join forces with us, anxious to fight against their captors.However, sometimes you will find that slaves are resistant to being freed.  It's a strange phenomenon, often called \"Durnholde Syndrome\".Either way, you should try to free them.  If they resist, treat them as enemies.  Report your results to Evonice Sootsmoker, deeper within the Slag Pit.28056Overseer Maltorius is in charge here, but he's not the only dwarf of power within the Slag Pit.  Lathoric the Black and his horrifying golem, Obsidion, loom just down this corridor.Interfering with Lathoric's altar should summon both of them.  Find it, then summon Lathoric and kill him.  Report to Evonice Sootsmoker when you're finished.28057It's a little known fact that dwarves, particularly of the Dark Iron variety, need rest! Lots of rest!Now I ask you; How can they sleep without pillows?  Exactly, , they can't.  This is why you must steal their pillows.Once you've finished your cushion-thievery, talk with Taskmaster Scrange.  He's a bit deeper in the cave, working on a covert project with Hansel.28058Well, well, well... Isn't this a surprise. The Chambermaid had a gigantic ornate pillow and now it's yours. Evonice Sootsmoker will definitely want to get her grubby little hands all over this item. Take it to her and see if she'll offer you any goodies for your trouble.28059Have you seen the keep on the north side of the island, ?  That is where Keep Lord Farson runs his operation from.Farson has a small group of dedicated followers and they have been giving us trouble since we got here.  We sent a small group to investigate and they reported back on his exact position within the keep.Can you finish him off for us?28060Hansel and I came here on a secret mission: kill Overseer Maltorius.  While our main goal still remains the same - defeating Archduke Calcinder - it can't hurt to take out the infamous overseer of the Slag Pit while we're here.Problem is, Hansel was only prepared to fight one dwarf, but it looks like Maltorius has a visitor... an emissary from the Twilight's Hammer!Speak with Hansel and help him out.  Then proceed down this corridor and along the balcony outside to find Overseer Oilfist.28061There is such a thing as digging too deep, .  While you'll find the richest mineral veins deep below the surface, you'll also find the most evil creatures.Like fire elementals.Calcinder's minions roam the cavern ahead.  Every one of them holds a piece of Calcinder's evil within it.  Slay as many as you can, and show no remorse.28062Archduke Calcinder squirms in the back of this very cavern.  We are close to killing him... but that is not what we are going to do.Slaying Calcinder here means nothing.  His acolytes can easily revive him.  Instead, we are going to banish him.I asked you to gather a precious stone from the Twilight's Hammer earlier.  You will now use it against Calcinder.  Engage him, weaken him, then use this device on him.  He will be banished from this realm.Good luck, brave .28063Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock.  Every time we hold off another horde attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones.Reports have come in that Keep Lord Farson on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use.  Can you head down there and check it out?Be careful , Farson's followers will do anything to protect him.28064You should return to Thorium Point.  Overseer Oilfist and the rest of the Thorium Brotherhood will be wondering how you fared in the fight against Calcinder.28065We have sent at least 3 different recon groups to investigate Farson Hold in the last few weeks.  Sadly, not one of them has returned back with any info.At this point, all we can hope is that they are being held alive as prisoners.  I need you to infiltrate the keep and help get our soldiers back.  This won't be easy , but if anyone can help us, it's you.28068King Varian Wrynn has requested that any able-bodied adventurer head to Blackrock Depths, northwest of Morgan's Vigil, immediately!The Dark Iron dwarves pose a serious threat to the citizens of Redridge!

Destiny calls!28090The gates further down the canyon are shut. Our scouting revealed some kind of stone that they carry in chests in their caravans that they use to open the gates.Get down there and look for a chest key on the bodies of the guards. When you find it, use it on one of those chests on the caravan wagons and bring the gatestone back to me.28091The ambush launched smoothly. Most of the guards are dead, but a few are still pinned down with the wagons.You can see them just to our west, in the canyon below. Get in there and clear them out so we can get this attack on the move.28092The wyrms have already taken the battle to the sky above Grim Batol. It's up to us to move our men in by ground and secure the gates.I want you to know what is at stake here, . Grim Batol is the source of Twilight's Hammer reinforcements to all of the highlands. If we do not cut them off here, we will not win the battles ahead.I'm sending the Gob Squad with you. Get to the gate to the southeast and get it open. Patch should have any further instructions you'll need from there.28093Good work so far. We should find the entrance to Grim Batol just past the next gate.I was ordered to secure the entrance and block off reinforcements while the rest of our men press through the path we've cleared up the canyon. I'm thinking if we get there soon enough, maybe I can let Ticker have a little more fun.Let's get moving down the canyon to the southwest - we should find the next gate pretty quickly.28094My orders are to accompany you south through the Dragonmaw Gates towards the entrance of Grim Batol.

Yes, indeed, this is the good life and you are going to live it!I want you to take these orders and dispense them to the lowly scrubs that come along looking for work. Who you give what to is wholly at your discretion.When you're ready, mount up on my trusty skeletal steed - so they don't miss you - and start living the life! Which means just stand there and wait.28097Kroggs started the assault to push up the canyon. He's just past the gate to our southeast.I'm going to get the squad together to join the attack. We'll meet you down there.28098Twilight Skymaster Richtofen is at the Twilight Aerie up above and to the southeast. No matter what we do down here, if he's not dealt with, all hope is lost for Highperch.While Heartrazor is too injured to help you with the fight, he can fly you up there. The rest is up to you, .Good luck.28099Based on this information you've delivered, I believe that one of this \"Archduke's\" minions may already have turned its eyes toward Thorium Point.His name is Rasha'krak, and he patrols the lava pools just to our south.  He looks like the latent fire elementals that rage nearby, except for one small difference: the bracers of binding that encircle his wrists.Find him and bring these bracers to me, .  I need proof that we are in danger before we involve ourselves in elemental wars.28100The furbolg village to the south is the home of the Deadwood tribe, sworn enemies of the Timbermaw. They are corrupted and foul like so many others, driven mad by the taint of these woods.Something unusual has occured near the village though. Travelers coming here have said that the totem next to the road has spoken to them.I have heard nothing every time I approach it. Perhaps it will speak to you, ? Maybe you can find out what's going on for me.28101Recent events make it even more apparent that holing up here and making sporadic attacks on Grim Batol isn't enough to keep our kind safe, much less retake Grim Batol. We need to be more aggressive, we need to strike into their heart.I've agreed to send dragons to the aid of your commanders. They were already hatching a plan to strike at Grim Batol, so you should focus your attention there first.You should be able to find Mathias Shaw in Dragonmaw Pass, in the canyon below us to the south.28102It's time for the final push against the Jadefire!If you're prepared to break through their foul barrier and bring the fight to their leader, I'd also ask your help against the lesser satyr. Our druids fight ferociously, but your strength can help turn the battle.Show the Jadefire that their power will no longer hold sway over these lands!28103The ambush launched smoothly. Most of the guards are dead, but a few are still pinned down with the wagons.Get in there and clear them out so we can push forward into the canyons.28104The gates further down the canyon are shut.

Slay him once you are through!28114Directly southeast of Southpoint Gate you will find our spider domestication operations. Through the years we have grown a kinship with the spiders of Hillsbrad and have managed to domesticate and breed the adorable little critters.

Such diverse creatures they are!I need you to head into the fields to the southeast and carefully harvest the eggs that we have incubating on the bears. Deliver the harvest to Sarus at the mine.28115Bears are soulless beasts put upon this earth to torment us. Only through Forsaken ingenuity have we devised a way to make use of the bears so that they may serve some purpose! We use the bears at our spider farm as living egg feeders.

Travel southeast and kill the infested bears that have lived past their prime.28116We must prepare carefully before assaulting Jaedenar. The magic of the warlocks and demons within Jaedenar is strong, and we will need wards of our own before entering.We need only one more ingredient: Crying Violet, which grows in the hills near the enemy's stronghold to the northwest.

It seems that everytime we get close, that archmage shows up and pushes us back.Now that we have claimed the island, it's time we take another shot.  Head down there and bring me back his staff as proof that you have finished the job.28119The flowers you brought me were the essential ingredient.Protective barriers surround Shadow Hold, projected from demonic braziers. If we are to drive the Shadow Council from Felwood, then those braziers must be extinguished.This vial has been infused with crying violet and the magic of the wilds. Fill it at the corrupted moonwell in the center of Jaedenar and return to me.28120Now that we finally have a hold on this wretched island, we can start to investigate how it got in this condition.  Some of our troops have discovered journals around the entrance to the Cursed Depths cellblock just east of here.These journals are of particular interest to our elder scribes back at base camp.  I need you to recover four of them and bring them back to me as fast as you can., be careful down there, that place is crawling with undead.28121The Shadow Council perpetuates the corruption of this land. At Jaedenar in the northwest, they worship the demons of the Burning Legion, and work to open the path for their masters to return to this world.The grounds are patrolled by Jaedenar Hounds, Guardians, Adepts, and Cultists - thugs that act as lookout for the more vile forces beneath.

Some say he is the son of Xavius, the first satyr, blessed by Sargeras himself.Whatever his nature, he must die if we are to scatter the Jadefire and reclaim our barrow dens. Journey deep into Shadow Hold and slay him. Show him no mercy; he will have none for you.28130Have you been up to Rustberg Village yet ?  I would suggest you bring a sharpened blade if you are heading that direction.The folks in that town look alright but something suspicious is going on in there.

Find out where the enemy will strike.28135Listen, .  What struck Orsis was no natural sandstorm.  It was the minions of Al'Akir.The elemental lord of air is firmly allied with Deathwing and it was only a matter of time before he set his subjects upon my people.Orsis has been attacked as a warning to us.  We must move quickly to offer our brethren what aid we can.Meet with Nadun at the Arsad Trade Post outside of Mar'at.  I will begin preparations to take care of the displaced and wounded.28136The three leaders of the Bulwark are powerful and not to be underestimated, . Fortunately for us, you now have a disguise to make you look like one of the Twilight cultists.You should put the disguise on and speak with Codemaster Deethuk, Commander Fastfuse, and Elementalist Starion each alone.

I have no clue where bandits learned to fish as well as they do but I have no time to worry about that now.I need you to head down there and steal as many of their fish reserves as possible.  We have been living off scraps since we retook the island and this is our best chance at some solid food reserves.Keep an eye out for stealthers up there, reports have told us they are prevalent inside the village walls.28138This mine was once the heart of Alliance mining operations in Hillsbrad. It now serves as a breeding ground for our loyal spiders, though, the humans still occupy it - in a way.But onto business! Warden Stillwater has called for more workers at the Sludge Fields. I want you to enter the mine with these shackles and capture Hillsbrad humans for labor in the fields.Break them out of their web paralysis and beat them into submission before you use the shackles.28139, the bonds holding Magatha are specially encoded.

Now all you have to do is head to the eastern section of the Bulwark and free the Elder Crone.Good luck, . Thank you for all you've done.28141The Seal of the Sun King serves as a defense mechanism for Ramkahen.When the barrier around Uldum fell, we began to see Wastewander outriders from Tanaris filter into our borders.They attacked this holy site on their way west and robbed it of the relics which once provided its power.Recover the relics for us.  Without them we are powerless to defend against attacks from the desert.28142According to Magatha, she'll meet you just outside of the Twilight Withering to the east.28143You should not keep the Elder Crone waiting, .She said that she'd be up top and just outside of the Twilight Withering to the east.28144The long stretch of coastline directly south of our position that extends from west to east is known as the Western Strand. Along the Western Strand you will find two things: murlocs and our stolen \"supplies.\"Those damned thieving murlocs struck while our backs were turned and took our \"supplies.\"Sarus and I cannot leave this post.

We need those humans for use in the Sludge Fields.I want you to take one of my hungry mine spiders out and feed it murlocs from the Western Strand, south of here. Whatever you kill, it'll eat! The more the better!28147So far as I can tell, the Glopgut Ogres right outside the cave here have not yet joined up with the Twilight's Hammer. If we're clever, we can turn the two groups against each other.Let's roll with a little trick I learned in Silithus. First we'll need to put together a set of cultist robes for you.Head south of here and kill some Twilight Windwarpers in the Twilight Breach. Aside from disrupting whatever they're up to, it'll give you a chance to collect garment scraps.28148The sickening corruption of demons pervades this entire forest. The soil, the trees, the animals... all grow thick with fel magics.We of the Emerald Circle have sworn to cleanse this forest, and doing so requires a constant battle.

Whenever you go north into Glopgut's Hollow now, your Twilight's Hammer regalia will fool the ogres.The rest of the plan is simple: you kill a bunch of Glopgut ogres, and they blame the cult. Are you ready to create some havoc in the ogre camp? I thought so.28152The cultists you saw guarding the claw were members of the Shadow Council, foul warlocks behind nearly every attempt to bring demons into Azeroth.North of here is Jaedenar, named in worship of Kil'Jaeden himself. Deep beneath it stretches Shadow Hold, a former barrow den and the Shadow Council's own stronghold on Azeroth.Take these herbs north to Wildheart Point, on the east side of the road. Greta Mosshoof will need them for her plan to purify Shadow Hold for good.28153Shadow Lord Fel'dan awaits further in the depths, .His wrath will be unmatched now that you have slain his beloved pets. Even without Moora and Salia at his side, he is a terrible force to be reckoned with.Beware his dark powers; he is nearly more demon than orc by now.28154This looks like Muckgill's flipper or something.

It's a combination of the four elements infused with the power of their special ore, Elementium.If you want to save your precious Thousand Needles from total destruction, you're going to have to destroy it. But first, you'll need a few things to get through its protective shielding.Go east into the Withering and bring back the four Twilight elements.28158There are two very powerful elementals that the Twilight's Hammer have bound.

The hides off those crocs will come in handy for our leatherworkers.  Bring back as many as you can.28163We fought hard to capture this island, .  We cleared out most of the horde scum but I can still smell their foul stench in the air.I need you to investigate the slagworks, warden's vigil and the ironclad garrison.

It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island.  Problem is, it's infested with demons.

Good luck, , and I'll see you on the surface.28168Warden Stillwater, over at the Sludge Fields, north of here, has sent out a distress signal. The missive wasn't clear, but from what I could make of the letter there's a riot happening at the Sludge Fields and most of the guards have been killed. The warden has warned that any would-be-heroes approach from the back entry, located on the western side of the Sludge Fields.He's also asked for discretion. He doesn't want news of this little *ahem* uprising to surface.28169Excellent job gathering the other survivors! They - and you - are the reason S.A.F.E. teams keep coming down here.

The black dragonflight is to be wiped out.I would welcome your aid in this, if it is offered. As soon as you are ready, I will send you with the next flight joining the attack.28172The Blackrock orcs of the steppes serve a dark master -  one who performs twisted experiments on living creatures to create his own menagerie of abominations.  Many of his test subjects are as corrupted as their master, but others are completely innocent.In the whelping downs to the south, they chain baby dragons to the ground, preparing them for such experiments.  I will not stand for this.  Break their fetters and return the hatchlings to me... to safety.28173The Twilight Drakehunters used vicious implements to drag our circling drakes from the sky. Hooks that buried into their scales and held the Twilight secure while they brought our kin to the ground.We are past the point of peace. Past hope for their redemption. The only mercy we have left to offer the black flight is the oblivion that they so passionately pursue.Use these hooks to slay the Obsidian Pyrewings to the south. They should allow you much maneuverability in the air if used right.28174The Blackrock orcs are ceaseless.  They swarm atop the battle-plains to the east, poised to strike at any moment.They already attacked my homeland once.  I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen again.If you hold any love for mankind, you'll do the same.  So prove yourself.  Travel south, to the Whelping Downs, and slay their whelpers and the hatchling black dragons.  Prove to me that you're ready for this war.28175The great petrified tree that lies before us to the south was once a beacon of great life. Our beacon. We lost this forest to the black flight, and it has since been corrupted and petrified. Nearly unredeemable.But all is not without hope. I've brought a powerful tool to begin the healing process. The tree may still be saved, with much time and fortune, and with perhaps a little effort from you.Bring this, Alexstrasza's Tear, and use it within the hollowed heart of the tree.28176In the southwestern portion of the Obsidian Forest, you will find some of the black egg clutches. Many of the eggs can be hatched at any time with a bit of prodding from the right flame, and as the whelplings hatch, they will cry out and flock for their mother.Do not worry, if this purging is to be taken to the whelps, that is not a task that I will force on you. I simply want you to let them out and follow them home as they seek their mother. It is she who we must confront.28177If we're going to wage war against the Blackrock clan, we're going to need to plan ahead.  My colonel has already put the plan together - now it's time to execute.I need scorpid stingers... the sharpest ones you can find.  Scorpids are all over the steppes, but you can find most of them in the gulch to the west.Don't worry about what they're for.  You'll find out soon enough.28178We'll need worg hides, and lots of them.  It doesn't matter if they're torn, burned, or bloody, but we need plenty of them.Actually, it's probably better if they're a little beat-up.You'll find worgs both to the west and to the east of here.28179Hope you're not afraid of getting dirty.  Judging by the looks of you, that won't be a problem.To the north, at the lava's edge, you'll find piles of dark mud.  I need it.It'd be best if you didn't ask questions, and focused your efforts on following orders, .28180Colonel Troteman is waiting for us to the east.  Before we head out though, we need to gather some more stuff.  This time, you'll be taking it from a warlock by the name of Gorzeeki Wildeyes.You'll probably find him to the northwest, near the Altar of Storms.  Tell him he's going to help us out.  We need the sand, the cider, and the orb.He'll know what it means.28181Keeshan said he needs supplies?  I've got plenty of supplies!  Problem is, those warlocks have kicked me out of my home, and they're not letting me back in.You might be able to get in, though.  Head north, and grab some of my slumber sand, my fel slider cider, and a clear glass orb.  I'm pretty sure that's what he wants.Oh, and if you happen to accidentally kill any of those orcs while you're up there, I wouldn't be terribly upset.28182Ner'gosh the Shadow is the leader of those warlocks to our north.  He's the jerk that kicked me out of my home once those Blackrock orcs started showing up.  Well, they're all jerks, but he's the jerkiest.If I'm ever going to move back in near the Altar, Ner'gosh has to go.28183Well I suppose I'm done with you here.  I'll go shoo those other warlocks out when I build up the courage.Here, don't forget those supplies.28184We're headed to Chiselgrip, right in the center of these steppes.  We'll rendezvous with the Thorium Brotherhood there, as well as with Troteman.You familiar with the Brotherhood?  Those dark iron dwarves have helped me out more than once.  We may need their help again.We'll pass through Black Tooth Hovel on our way there.  What do you say we kill a few orcs while we travel?  I'm getting a little restless here in this camp.28185Excellent work on the island capture, .  Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners.  D-Block has been especially hard to clear out.  Unfortunately it has become overrun with demons of all sorts.We have been able to thin out the demons but a large core hound has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there.  I need you to kill him and bring back his collar.28186Have you been down in the D-Block yet, ?  Every time we clear that infested cellblock out, the demons seem to return rather quickly.

Her lovely blonde locks and the way they framed her perfect blood elf face... She melted my shriveled heart. I didn't want to send her out, but she was so demanding! I had to give her what she asked for! Who could refuse such a vision?Alas, poor Jenny Awesome has not returned! I fear the worst, . Find her!28207This poor fellow here barely escaped Bloodvenom Post with his life! If we're going to keep him from turning into a slime creature like all the others, we've got to treat the infection.Mushrooms like to grow near the bright green waters around here, like the pond to the east beneath the falls.

Don't take too long now!28208Mr. Tauren here's told me a lot about what happened at Bloodvenom Post. He says Winna Hazzard is still there!She's pretty far gone, but what's left of her is making a bunch of new slime. We've got to stop it!Luckily, I have a plan.

She makes sure it keeps flowing, and it keeps her safe! But if you can get her attention...Take the eartag and show it to Winna. If there's even a little, tiny bit of her left, maybe it'll get through.

When I arrived, Twinkles and I were charged by the lumbering monstrosity known as Verringtan. I was knocked off of Twinkles and immediately ran for my life.

Specifically, he ended up telling me the one thing that all imps fear most. Something they're absolutely terrified of.I thought that sounded useful as well as interesting, so I've done some basic conjuring.

We'll now be moving on to the east, to Morgan's Vigil.Our intel indicates that Morgan's Vigil has been vacated, as most of its inhabitants have moved into Blackrock Mountain to fight their own battle against the Blackrocks.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.Of course, Keeshan will be joining you on the road.  As will I.28311I need you to do some more gathering before we can go take out the remainder of the Blackrock army.  If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right, and that means being prepared.I need ash, .  Not just any ash... ash from the greater obsidian elementals that roam the plains to the northwest.  The stuff is deep, deep black, which is what we need for our next disguise.Don't worry, you've already got a disguise.  This one is for someone... well, someTHING... else.28312The lava beds nearby - to the west - play host to flamekin, a brand of fire demon that has long roamed the steppes.  Situations are such in the Blackrock army that, if we are careful, we may be able to sneak some of these flamekin behind enemy lines to cause some havoc.Bring me the bodies of several flamekin.  As demons, they are easily resurrected, and then we can use them for our own purposes.28313We're going to need fresh meat, which means you're going to be hunting worg.  The worg on this side of the steppes should be your target.Hunt the giant ember worgs.  Once you've killed them, use this saw to remove the choicest bits of meat from their bodies.  You will find these worgs all over the steppes, but the closest pack rules the land just to our northeast.28314My legs are getting a little restless again.  You interested in taking a little tour, ?We're going to take a trip around Dreadmaul Rock.  I'd like to investigate some of the Blackrock army before we make our move, and I figure we might as well kill some of them while we're on the way.28315The Blackrock orcs don't come alone.  You've already seen that they've got the Firegut ogres and Smolderthorn trolls on their side.  Unfortunately for us, they're also teamed up with the black dragonflight.The orcs and the dragons have already sent some of their champions to stand guard at rally points, which are marked by a dragon skull on a pike.  You and I are going to find these rally points and take out this vanguard before the battle starts.Ready?28316While we are circling around Dreadmaul Rock, there's one more stop that we need to make.You remember the hatchlings that you freed from the Whelping Downs?  Troteman's been hanging onto them, and we're going to deliver them to someone who will take care of them better than we can.  He's staying in Slither Rock, to the northeast of Dreadmaul Rock.His name is Acride, and he might be the key to victory in the upcoming battle.28317General Thorg'izog is staying among the ogres in the Firegut Furnace, a cave on the western edge of Dreadmaul Rock.  I'd like you to deliver this to him and the ogres.Inside this package, you will find the worg cutlets you obtained, marinated in the fel slider cider that we took from the Altar of Storms.I would avoid eating it if I were you.Bring it to General Thorg'izog.  He will make sure that his troops are fed and, with any luck, he will eat some himself.28318The warlocks of the Blackrock Clan often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock.  Their leader, Xi'lun, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the big three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak.  And Neeralak's expertise is in dragons, not in necromancy.I've used the slumber sand on those flamekin you captured.  Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock imps, and not flamekin.  When they wake up, they won't be happy.28319Intel tells us that High Warlock Xi'lun - the final member of the Big Three - is within the cave atop Dreadmaul Peak, preparing for his big moment.He is waiting for a delivery: an Orb of Domination, with which he can perform a powerful summoning ritual.  I want you to give him this:This is the clear glass orb that you freed from the Altar of Storms.  It is powerless.  Give it to Xi'lun, and cross your fingers that he doesn't notice.28320This is it, .  This is where it hits the fan.  Where all the pieces come together.Strap in, and come with me.  We're going to go talk to Acride and call in that favor that he owes us.  Then we'll stop this invasion of Redridge before it even starts.28321You and Keeshan are going back to that mountain.  There's three orcs who survived the attack, and we won't rest until they're dead.That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three.General Thorg'izog crawled back into the Firegut Furnace, and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak.  Xi'lun is in the back of the Skull Warren, plotting with his fellow warlocks.Leave your mark, .  Hunt down those sniveling Blackrocks, and teach them the might of Redridge!28322We've toppled a giant today, .  While the Blackrock orcs still swarm in their spire, I doubt their plans will take them anywhere near Redridge anytime soon.  You and Keeshan saw to that.I'd say we were fairly resourceful here in Burning Steppes - those warlock supplies we collected certainly came in handy, as did the obsidian ash that we used to conceal our dragon.There were, however, some collected items left over.  Please, take your pick before you move on, beyond the steppes.28323Brother Silverhallow sent word that he wishes to speak with you. Next time you're in Orgrimmar, visit him in the Goblin Slums.  It sounded like he had something important on his mind.28324We used a fairly potent strain of blight against the humans of Southshore. As you can see, it worked. The trouble with blight use, though, is that blight tends to stick around after it's served its purpose.What I need from you is to take this testing kit and get out into the field to get a lethality count from the blight slimes that we've released into the area. Use the lethality analyzer on the blight slimes sweeping the slime pools. Come back to me when you have some solid data.28325Recycling! It's all the craze these days. The Banshee Queen has decreed that we must conserve if we are to prosper as a people. Everyone must do their part, right? With that said, you will be doing our part for us.There are likely thousands of blight canister bits and pieces all over Southshore. We can reuse those canisters for more blight bombing goodness. Just head into the ruins here and pick up whatever you can find.28326.  It sounds like you and Keeshan have finished with your tasks.  I've also finished mine.Return to Morgan's Vigil.  I've prepared a few packages to deliver to the Big Three: Thorg'izog, Neeralak, and Xi'lun.  You've already met General Thorg'izog.  This will be your chance to meet the other two.That is, before we kill them.28327, come in.  Can you read me?The battle is about to start.  I hope you've delivered all of those packages.I need you here in Morgan's Vigil, NOW.28328The influence of Twilight's Hammer reaches far and wide. They search ceaselessly for allies in their battle against us and they are recruiting the Dark Iron dwarves of Blackrock Depths to their cause.Moira's grip on the Dark Irons is tenuous at best and more of her people fall away from her rule with each day. We must sabotage their recruitment efforts.I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.28329These blight slimes seem to be really angry. They've even got a faint outline of an angry humanoid face in their ectoplasm. You don't think Hinott would be too happy about having non-compliant slimes working the slime pools.Kill any angry blight slimes that you see and try to get a lock on a breeding pool.28330The trail of filth and anger leads into the ruined town hall. Surely there is a slime breeding pool inside the structure. Fight your way inside and deal with whatever angry slime-breeder that you encounter!Should you succeed Serge Hinott at the Ruins of Southshore will surely want to hear about it.28331To think, I, a master of necromancy, trained by Kel'Thuzad himself, was reduced to nothing more than a corpse in a grave. Thankfully, my astute apprentice, Thaivand, managed to find a group of heroes to recover this:It is through the power of the rod that I was reborn. The rod giveth and the rod taketh away!Take it now and use it to empower our dark rangers battling the worgen in the field north of us. Renew their vigor with my rod.28332Our dark rangers search the fields for worgen terrorists. These worgen have been sent out by their dark masters to hunt and kill us. And though a dark ranger is a formidable combatant, the worgen often attack in packs, which can overwhelm even a dark ranger.Search the fields around the ruins of Southshore for Bloodfang forsaken hunters. Kill any that you see! For the Forsaken and for Lordaeron!28333Three things come out of Irontree Clearing: lumber, oil, and exhausted workers. The first two are pretty much the cause of the third, but I like to be efficient about things where I can.I've got our shredders working triple unpaid overtime, and there's really nowhere in the schedule for them to get maintenance.Use this grappling hook to nab some of the extra oil cans floating around camp and use them to oil up the shredders, would you?28334This operation's stayed pretty discreet so far, but the worgen over in Talonbranch Glade have it out for us. They've been trying everything they can to get us shut down.Some of the workers have told me they've seen glimpses of worgen lurking around the clearing. Take these oversized megaflares. They're bright enough to show anything that gets anywhere near them.Use the flares to look for prowling worgen, and make sure they don't leave here alive!28335It was those darn worgen! They blew right past me into the cavern.They must've messed with the Master Control Pump! If that thing is left on too long, every pipe runnin' under our feet is gonna blow. You think the leaks now are bad? Just wait!Listen, if you can reach the Master Control Pump all the way in the back of the cavern, you can shut it off and save us all!28336Oh for... not again! If you heard the deputy yelling out there, that means we've got a fullblown oil leak on our hands! It's those filthy worgen again!Listen, it's going to be total chaos out there. Sleep-deprived goblins running around screaming and not knowing what to do. I need you to snap the workers back to their senses.A good, swift backhand across the face should do it! Once they shake themselves off, they'll get to work capping those gushers!28337Disgusting, isn't it? Look at them. Pathetic little things that can't even toil with their own bodies.They stomp around in their massive metal shredders, carving the forest to splinters. I bet they think they're safe in there, all warm and cozy.Prove them wrong. Blaze north through the camp and destroy as many shredders as you can. Once you've spilled some blood, we're going to take this place apart for good.28338There is a camp of Deadwood furbolgs directly to our southwest.  Corruption permeates the camp, and I wish to put an end to it before they become a problem.The Deadwood tribe is evil, but it is the effects of the fel that pollutes their minds.  Their hostility is not truly an innate quality, yet they cannot be helped.  It saddens me that we must fight our own brethren.Please,  - I ask you to do what must be done.  Simply spare me the details; such troublesome images upset me far too much.28339Last time we had an oil leak this bad, the oil itself tried to get away!I don't know what does it, maybe all the demon goop floating around here, but when we get a big enough crude leak half of it globs together and tries to run away.That's profit trying to escape! Go run after those oil sludges and bring back their sweet, precious oil!28340All my workers got driven straight out of the cavern here by those big swamp-lookin' things! Darla's sent me here to pick up the pieces, but have you seen it in there? I ain't goin' in!There's a ton of explosives left behind that we can't just leave layin' around. I'll make you a deal: You run in there and get those explosives gathered up, and I will stay here and not get killed by swamp-things, and if you don't either, I'll pay ya! How's that sound?28341Though we druids shun the demonic powers infesting this land, it must still be confronted.Shatter Scar Vale to the south seethes with corruption. The energies there are so chaotic that they manifest as violent entities, pure fel magic given form to lash out at all life.I have been keeping a close eye on these chaotic beasts, and studying their strength. I need to make sure they are still weakening with time. Bring me the essences they drop, so I may ensure they are diminishing.28342The infernals that lurk in Shatter Scar Vale are formidable, but not invincible. Much progress has been made in thinning their numbers.Destroying them is only part of the solution, however. I've found that the stone that infernals are made of still contains large amounts of fel magic even after the infernal's death.The rubble of slain infernals now litters Shatter Scar Vale, leeching its corruption back into the ground. If you could collect it and bring it to me, I would be grateful.28343, we have learned that a missing Cenarion artifact has surfaced in the hands of a Twilight's Hammer pyromancer. Pyromancer Loregrain has taken this artifact, the Breath of Cenarius, into Blackrock Depths and uses its power to open elemental gates.We must act to keep Loregrain from summoning elementals to bolster the ranks of his Dark Iron allies. Recover the artifact from him and use its power to close the gates that Loregrain has been using.28344Shortly before you arrived an orc flew in upon a frost wyrm and demanded that I direct him to where the 'newbies were hanging out.' Uncertain as to the vernacular, I told him to fulfill his duty as a member of the Horde and deal with the worgen threat of the area. He grumbled something about 'what the lok'tar was cooking' and headed south to the docks.Ordinarily I wouldn't care about whether or not an orc went missing, but I am genuinely curious about what the lok'tar might be cooking. Find out.28345*GURGLE*HELP!*GASP*ORKUS IS DROWNING! HELP ME, QUEST GIVER !*GLUB*Dwarf threw Orkus into the water! Must not die!*GURGLE*The shame would be too great.28346We need to make this work, . The answer is in the blood! Family bonds have kept these Wildhammer clans apart from one another. It'll take family bonds to glue 'em back together. It's a long shot, but we're going to have to play matchmaker!I'll track down Colin Thundermar and talk with him. You're a smooth one - you should talk to Keegan Firebeard inside. He's sharp enough to understand a political marriage. Go find out if he fancies anyone!28348I tracked down the decrepit necromancer, Helcular, in hopes of getting a lead on Alliance movement within Hillsbrad.Helcular tasked me with finding and killing worgen. Ordinarily this would not be a problem for Orkus, but I had just eaten several helpings of Dirge's Kickin' Chimaerok chops, causing my bowels to cry out in anguish. That's when the trouble began and how I ended up in the water.Hear Orkus out, .28349Boss, while you were down at the mines, Megs Dreadshredder in marketing was asking for you. Something about your new ride?She's right outside the building to the left.28350One thing about me that you might not know, ...I come from a long line of trappers. My father taught me, as his taught him, to master the art of trapping creatures in a most merciful manner.As any master trapper will tell you, the most important ingredient in an effective trap is the bait.So let's start there.Fill this bucket with the meat scraps from almost any wild creature in Uldum.28351Some see the little sand pygmy as nothing more than a pest, a vermin, or worse yet, a vile little demon.I say they are simply misunderstood!With the proper care and guidance, these little fellows may just turn out to be a glorious gift of nature.I would like you to take these cages and use them to capture a few of them for me to work with.You will need to give them a sound beating before boxing them up, but in the end it will be for their own good.You'll see!Go south for pygmies!28352Greetings, friend!You are always most welcome in my humble tent.Looking for something to do? Sullah has just the thing!Camels are good to have in hand regardless, but when putting together a performance the likes of my sideshow, they are an absolute must!Take this harness and use it to subdue a wandering camel.You may have to, uhh, humble it a bit first... if you know what I mean.You'll find a desert full of wild camels to the south.28353Listen, , you may want to make your way back to Jonesy when you get a moment.Chances are, whatever he's got to talk to you about is more pressing than anything I have for you to do.28354Kasha will fly again, . She must if we are to claim vengeance! Sadly, Orkus must stay here with Kasha. You must help us. I beg of you!Listen carefully, quest giver. When I first arrived here I flew around for days to learn the lay of the land. There is a farm east of here that has long since been abandoned and is now overrun by gnolls. On this farm grows a special type of mushroom known as the mudsnout. Go to the stead and gather mudsnout for Kasha. Return here when your pack is full.28355Gnolls! These terrible little creatures are a blight upon any land - which is saying a lot when you consider that Hillsbrad is Forsaken territory. Kill as many of the gnolls at the Nethander Stead as you can. For the good of the world!28356These plans document what appears to be an imminent attack on Southshore. The naga of the Eastern Strand are planning to take over the town now that the Alliance has been pushed out.Not if you can help it!Kill all of the naga on the Eastern Strand and report to Helcular at the Ruins of Southshore with the Daggerspine attack plan.28357Those mangy curs think they can just snoop around my site and get away with it? I'll show them...And what I mean by that is, of course, that YOU will show them. You and the small army of axe-wielding goblin hires I've sent to Talonbranch Glade.The place will be swarming with worgen by now. Just where we want them. Head to the southeast, join up with the rest of our forces, and let some fur fly.28358The first demons to set foot in this forest were infernals. Long ago, these powerful beings of stone and demonic fire fell from the sky to take this land for the Burning Legion.The charred craters of Shatter Scar Vale to the south are where these infernals landed, and many still wander there. They are fierce foes, and killing them is both a worthy challenge and a noble cause.I offer reward for those who join the hunt. Return here afterwards.28359The most fearsome demon in Shatter Scar Vale is known as Kroshius. Though many have hunted him over the years, destruction has only made him stronger.Time after time, warlocks have come to this forest and reanimated Kroshius. He now lurks in the southeast, surrounded by demonic fire, awaiting any who come to try and claim his power.I will not have this corrupt cycle continue! Kill Kroshius, and bring his infernal core to me.28360I'd love so much to save every creature in the forest, but as you probably have seen, some are just too far gone.When we first founded Whisperwind Grove, the woods just to the south were full of beautiful coursers, majestic and gentle creatures. The corruption here hasn't made them violent, but they've wasted away to nearly nothing.Even if they were cleansed, they would know only pain and suffering. Please, , help put them down for me.28361The larger animals are often too far corrupted to save, but you'd be surprised how hardy the little ones are.Take the squirrels, for example. After washing in corrupted water, they can spread illness far from the original source, but it's slow to affect the squirrels themselves. In fact, a simple washing will result in a clean squirrel and a safer forest!Here, take this bottle of cleaning mixture. Grab and scrub any squirrel you see in the woods to the south... they'll be thankful for it!28362Stupid, stupid Drizle! I told him not to go!Drizle wanted to steal more honey from Felpaw Village... you know, just west of here? You can see it from the cliff...Anyway... I told him it was a dumb idea but he went anyway, and then the Deadwood tribe got him, and... and...Sniff...I don't know what they're gonna do! Please find him,  ! Even if he is a dummy! I don't want Drizle to get eaten!28363Wow!It sounds like you really got their attention, . We're never getting in there with them on alert like this.There must be a way...It's just a matter of time before Schnottz's men activate the obelisk and I need to research the scrolls you found. I need you to figure this one out without me.Sullah has connections in these parts. Maybe he has a solution for getting us inside.28364Sniff... I'm sorry! I didn't mean to get caught! They grabbed me and put this chain on me and left me here! I can't move and my leg fell asleep and I'm hungry!The chief has the key... Chieftain Bloodmaw, the other ones said. He's in the north end of the camp.But hurry! Please! Don't leave me alone here!28366I would prefer to do as much as we can to protect my people from the Deadwood tribe without slaughtering every last one of them. We've taken steps towards this before, and if you wish to prove yourself to the Timbermaw tribe, I would ask you do this as well.Look for the piles of weapons kept in Felpaw Village to the southwest. Take as many as you find. If we disarm the Deadwood tribe, we may be able to stop some bloodshed later.28367It is good to have friends, ! While kindness is its own reward, there can be tangible benefits too!Some friends of mine recently intercepted a shipment of Schnottz's plunder and found something that should serve your needs nicely.It's a piece of titan technology that renders the user nearly invisible. If you use it in the enemy camp, you might be able to rewire their explosives and make a mess of their operation.Each charge has a limited duration, so don't stray too far from safety!28368Land's sakes, pardner! You done shut off those valves but good.Unfortunately we've had a critical blowout in our gosh-darned central burnoff regulator! Missus Darla's done sent as many workers as she can rustle to go shut it off, but those flames have a mind of their own!Literally! They're hoppin' up and grabbin' anyone who comes near! So Darla says if you can muster up out of that cave you're in and beat that elemental, she's got a mighty fine prize in store for ya!28369Before you go, be sure to stop by the inn behind me. My sister Fanny is inside.Refugees are pouring into Thundermar from all of the torched Wildhammer settlements around us, and I put Fanny in charge of 'em. She's tough as talons, that one. But she might need your help.28370Can you believe these worgen here have wisps?  The night elves showed them all that druid junk and now they've got their precious little wisps too, giving them all the building material they want without having to harm any precious trees.If we had those things, we could pull extra wood out of every tree in our site. Free resources, free profit! That's why I've been working on this containment device.Head to Talonbranch Glade and use it to steal some wisps. Just point and press the button.28372All this happy friends stuff is great, isn't it? People working together, healing the forest. But what's gonna happen to the forest when it's healed? It's just gonna sit there?We need this lumber. The Horde needs it. I've got orders here to send as many loyal Horde soldiers--and I'm sure you're loyal--up north to Irontree Clearing.I've already arranged for the hippogryph master to give you a free ride over there. Talk to Darla Drilldozer when you touch down.28373Okay, I know this is a longshot, but I figure it never hurts to ask.While I deal with the fallout of all the ridiculous nonsense that just went on here, I need you to go speak to some bears. The Timbermaw furbolg control the forests to the northeast, and they're not too fond of us.I just need someone to give them the idea the Horde isn't all that bad. Head northeast up the road to Timbermaw Hold--don't go into Felpaw Village--and ask the furbolg outside if they have any favors they'd like done.28374In a place like this, even something as simple as growing flowers and pulling weeds can require some heroic effort.The orchid lashers that grow on all sides of the grove are a sign of healing. But they're not flawless; some of them do succumb to demonic corruption now and then.I've found the best way to check is to just pull them up. If they're normal, they'll wander around a bit and reroot themselves. If they aren't... well, you'd better be ready for a fight!28375The time of vengeance has come, . Kasha can once more fly, thanks to you. She will take us to Purgation Isle so that we may confront the Stormpike dwarf general, Vanndar Stormpike, and his captain, Balinda Stonehearth. BOTH will pay for what they have done.Are you ready? Orkus cannot do this alone.28376The head of one of Deathwing's most formidable black dragons is now in your possession.While many in Azeroth would pay dearly for such an artifact, something tells you that it belongs in a museum for all to see and remember.Harrison Jones is likely to have the proper connections.Sullah would certainly be happy to deliver it to him.28377Well speak of the devil in a blue dress. Fanny's gone and gotten herself kidnapped by ogres!I don't trust the Thundermars to be able to mount a rescue on their own. I'll round up my gryphon riders and provide some air support.I'm sure they can use an extra  down there, . Grab your gear and look for Colin Thundermar in the Glopgut ogre camp. It's southwest of here, below the cliffs. Hurry now!28378We've started tearing this camp apart, , but there's no sign of Fanny. Maybe you can find her.We haven't checked the cave just behind me, to the northwest. See if you can find Fanny in the cave!28379Glopgut ogres! I'd say they was dumb as a sack of hammers, but I have more respect for me hammers than that.We've fought off their raids for years, but if they're bold enough to steal one of our own, we're gonna have to learn them a lesson.Help us smack around some Glopgut ogres! Kill their pounders, hurlers, or bashers either out here or - better - inside the cave. That'll show 'em.28380What the heck is going on here? Foreman Pikwik should've shut the valves off by now.We can cap these leaks all day and if the central valve is off, we're just delaying an enormous explosion.Listen, if you value money, your life, or either combination of the two, you'd better head south to Irontree Cavern and see if you can find Foreman Pikwik.28381Barely a crow's flight to the north, goblins ravage this forest, clearcutting it to fuel the war machines of the Horde and line their own pockets. This one pays enough pleasant words and crafted lies to the druids here for them to turn a blind eye, afraid to disturb the tenuous neutrality here.The worgen of Talonbranch Glade have had enough. Join us! The hippogryph master can take you directly to our home. Denmother Ulrica will welcome any  who wishes to fight.28382The goblins are already upon us!We have tried everything in our power to warn the goblins to leave Irontree Clearing before we resorted to violence. As they turned a blind ear to us, we struck, and now rather than spare the forest they would lay down their lives for greed.They will soon know the full extent of our fury! The battle rages just beyond our northern gate. Join our pack in glory and slay any goblin who dares come before us!28383I have toiled long here with the Denmother to spread the teachings of Cenarius and the ways of the wild. She has gained much of my trust, and in return, I have been allowed to introduce the spirits of the forest to her students. The company of wisps is a great honor, as well as a useful blessing.But now the goblins descend on us, and seek to steal the wisps for nefarious use. Please, prevent this blasphemy!Call the wisps back here from the western woods with this blessed branch, and keep them safe.28384Irontree Clearing must be razed. We can afford no mercy if we want to prevent the goblins from spreading their destruction through the entire forest.Alton Redding, my most trusted protector, has already led much of the pack around the enemy line to strike while they are distracted here. Seek him out to the west, overlooking Irontree Cavern.28385I plan to use the goblin's greed and pollution against them. Any further despoiling of the land they have already carved here will be worth it to stop their further spread.Deep within Irontree Cavern, just below us, runs many pipes to pump oil through the ground across the entire clearing. These pipes are attached to a master control pump in the very back of the cavern.Enter the cavern and sabotage the pump. The ensuing havok will give us opportunity for our final strike.28386The workers in Irontree Cavern below us have been driven out already. Something else has overtaken the cave.This works in our favor. I spotted at least a few of them dropping explosives as they fled... explosives we'll need for the next part of our plan.Enter the cave and salvage any abandoned bombs you can find. When you're finished with that and the pump, we'll begin our final assault.28387Your pump sabotage has caused pipes to break all over camp. The goblins are in a panic over the geysers, and it's about to get worse.Take the gathered explosives and use them to set the geysers aflame. We're going to do as much damage to the camp as we can, and keep that oil from being used to fuel shredders... or worse, Horde warships.28388Sad little cowards... look at them flee in panic!Don't let it fool you, . The second they've regained their wits, those goblins are going to spend every waking moment chopping this forest to bits and sending the pieces to the Horde's war effort.Don't give them the chance. Kill the workers throughout Irontree Clearing without mercy... show them their greed has a price!28389With the goblins scattered and their equipment destroyed, they'll either get the message and leave, or be easy pickings if they choose to stay. We've won here.You've fought as fiercely as any member of the pack, . Return to the Denmother and let her know of our success. I'll be maintaining my watch.28390Glop had a son.

There's evidence that they are preparing a joint attack from within Blackrock Mountain. We'll be hard-pressed to turn back such a combined force, but if we act before they're ready to strike, we might be able to blunt the attack.You must go into Blackrock Depths and capture the Twilight's Hammer attack plans from General Angerforge in the West Garrison. Do not hesitate to take out the elementals supporting his forces.28394The latest SI:7 intelligence on Blackrock Depths is troubling, . It appears Twilight's Hammer is working with the Dark Iron engineer, Argelmach, to create war golems powered by elementals. These golems could prove to be a devastating weapon if used against us.You must prevent that from happening, . Find the Manufactory in Blackrock Depths, capture the blueprints he's using to make those golems, and recover the elemental modules he's using to power them.283952839628397They made a mistake by not killing me when they had the chance. Perhaps they thought Orkus would drown. HAH! Now they will pay the price for their carelessness.You and I will tear this island apart, . They will never expect this! Once all of their soldiers are dead we will confront the leaders. Be on the lookout for attack plans. If we can get our hands on their plans we will be able to put a stop to their whole invasion!Let's go, !28398The power of the Dark Iron forces and their Twilight's Hammer allies is growing within Blackrock Mountain. Pyromancer Loregrain, a magus of renown, plays an important role in leading the Twilight's Hammer forces there. If we could get our hands on his grimoire, I might be able to devise counterspells and other ways of dampening their elemental magics.You must descend into Blackrock Depths, locate the Shrine of Thaurissan, and capture the grimoire. Show Loregrain and his Twilight minions no mercy.28399I have it on good authority that SI:7 is concerned about collaboration between Twilight's Hammer and the Dark Iron dwarves in Blackrock Depths. We can act on this information, prove our value to the Alliance, and gain something for ourselves at the same time.The report mentions that the Twilight's Hammer followers have placed a number of elemental binding stones throughout Shadowforge City, the Domicile, the Shrine of Thaurissan, the West Garrison and the East Garrison. Find and capture those stones!28400Now to find their battle plans and take out their leaders! Should we succeed there is an orc high warlord who served in the war in Silverpine that is now stationed at Tarren Mill - located in the heart of Hillsbrad. He will grant both of us commendations for this! We will be heroes of the Horde, !Onward! Together we will defeat the Alliance filth!28401Within the halls of Blackrock Depths, the Twilight's Hammer cult and the Dark Iron dwarves are gathering their forces. Backing up their legions are hordes of fire elementals bound to the service of the firelord, Ragnaros.If we can free those elementals from their bonds, we can both weaken our enemies and honor the elements. Take this totem with you and use it on subdued fireguards. It will free their spirits from their bondage and restore them to their natural state.28402I'm nearly ready, .Your scrolls contained enough information to discern their encryption method. Now all that's left is for me to translate the codes.I need you to scout out the chamber beneath the Obelisk of the Moon. There are likely to be a few of Schnottz's troops down there that escaped your blast.You take care of them and I'll meet you there when I'm finished.28403There should be two titan communication devices in this chamber.If my translations are correct, one is a death trap and the other will accept the codes and activate the obelisk.Let's hope I get this right.Let me know when you're ready.28404Yes, this all looks familiar enough.Thanks to all the information you gathered for me, I'm sure that I can activate the mechanism. I'll just need some time free from distraction.As soon as I get started, you can count on that titan construct to try and stop me.That's where you come in.I don't need to remind you of what's riding on this. Take down that guardian!28405Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now SI:7 sends word that the Dark Irons and Twilight's Hammer are increasing their collaboration. Using the knowledge of the cult, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with elemental powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.28406Things are getting interesting in Blackrock Mountain, . Our sources report that the Dark Iron dwarves have formed closer ties with Twilight's Hammer and both are preparing for a major offensive.I've made the contents of the report known to key leaders in Stormwind and I want you to help deal with this emerging Dark Iron threat.The rations for most of the Dark Iron army are kept in the East and West Garrison of Blackrock Depths. Take this poison and apply it to their grain reserves.28407Firebeard? Marry my sister!? I swear the world's gone mad, !Still, maybe Kurdran is right. A nice normal wedding would ease everyone's mind... and maybe cool off Firebeard a little. It was great to actually work together here against the ogres.Right then! It's all up to Fanny. Something tells me she won't want to be tied down.Fly back to Kirthaven and see if she's game. I'll finish up the nasty business with the ogres here.28408By tradition, Wildhammer brides wear white to show their purity. In addition, they wear a crown of black feathers - to show their CHUTZPAH.Owl feathers make the boldest statement, and Fanny deserves nothing less. Tawny owls are native to the Highlands. Look for them circling near trees that grow along the cliffs, and take their feathers.You'll probably want to kill 'em, first.28409It would be an insult to celebrate a Wildhammer wedding without drink. Kurdran himself called for a few kegs of rare Thunderbrew Lager to be sent ashore from Highbank, but the caravan can't get through the pass.Follow the road east of here, around the south side of Thunderstrike Mountain, and catch up with the caravan. Look for a fellow named Hammelhand, and help him get the booze through the pass!28410Everyone's going to want to dress their best for this, and finery is in short supply in the Highlands.I understand that those goblin wretches off the coast use the finest silk for repairing their zeppelin air envelopes. A waste!Find a zeppelin flying back and forth between Dragonmaw Port and the Krazzworks, and liberate some silk from the cargo hold in the lower decks.28411Finally, we're going to need a feast. And none of that \"finger food\" stuff! This crowd wants meat, and lots of it.Gather up venison from Highland elk and does. Highland worg are good eatin' too - bring back some ribs. We'll show you a feast like you've never had in all the Eastern Kingdoms, friend.28413I've written many an epic tune in my lifetime, , but this upcoming wedding deserves a very special ballad. And fast!Should I write a love song? A lighthearted ditty? A bawdy drinking song?I could use some help with the lyrics, if you fancy a go at it.Talk to me and we'll write a song together!28414It's all up to you, kid. You demolished the Steamwheedle Sharks, so now all that's left to do is to kick the winning goal.Now, just between you and me, I think we should do this one right. I don't want you to just kick a goal... I want you to kick it so far it sails between the two smokestacks behind the goal!I've modified the footbomb to give you the extra power that you'll need.Now get out there and make me proud!28415We have to take action.  Winky and Gor'tesh were fighting, so I planned this friendship ceremony to help the two of them make up.  Everything was going well, until...Well, you know the rest.I even bought drinks!Winky loves flameflies.  He runs off to chase them most every night.  I'm thinking maybe that's where he went.You'll find flameflies to the west and north, wherever you find lava.  Bring me seven of them, and hurry!Gor'tesh might leave next!28416... is that you?  I thought you were dead, with the rest of them!No, you were always strong, even back then, even in Redridge.Our fight's not over, .  They already attacked our homeland once.  I'm here to make sure it doesn't happen again.If you can still fight like you did back in the day, then join me.  You can start by heading south, to the Whelping Downs, and slaying their whelpers and their hatchling black dragons.It'll be like old times.28417The Blackrock orcs of the steppes serve a dark master -  one who performs twisted experiments on living creatures to create his own menagerie of abominations.  Many of his test subjects are as corrupted as their master, but others are completely innocent.In the whelping downs to the south, they chain baby dragons to the ground, preparing them for such experiments.  I will not stand for this.  Break their fetters and return the hatchlings to me... to safety.28418I am a Blackrock orc by birth.  I spent a large part of my youth inside that mountain.But while I share blood with them, I do not share their outlook.  And I am seeking an ally to assist me in stopping their upcoming attack.So prove yourself.  Travel south, to the Whelping Downs, and slay their whelpers and the hatchling black dragons.  Prove to me that you're ready for this war.28419If we're going to wage war against the Blackrock clan, we're going to need to plan ahead.  My father has already put the plan together - now it's time to execute.I need scorpid stingers... the sharpest ones you can find.  Scorpids are all over the steppes, but you can find most of them in the gulch to the west.Don't worry about what they're for.  You'll find out soon enough.28420According to my father, we'll need worg hides, and lots of them.  It doesn't matter if they're torn, burned, or bloody, but we need plenty of them.Actually, it's probably better if they're a little beat-up.You'll find worgs both to the west and to the east of here.28421Hope you're not afraid of getting dirty.  Judging by the looks of you, that won't be a problem.To the north, at the lava's edge, you'll find piles of dark mud.  I need it.It'd be best if you didn't ask questions, and focused your efforts on following orders, .28422My father is waiting for us to the east.  Before we head out though, we need to gather some more supplies.  This time, you'll be taking it from a warlock by the name of Gorzeeki Wildeyes.You'll probably find him to the northwest, near the Altar of Storms.  Tell him he's going to help us out.  We need the sand, the cider, and the orb.He'll know what it means.28423Ariok said he needs supplies?  I've got plenty of supplies!  Problem is, those warlocks have kicked me out of my home, and they're not letting me back in.You might be able to get in, though.  Head north, and grab some of my slumber sand, my fel slider cider, and a clear glass orb.  I'm pretty sure that's what he wants.Oh, and if you happen to accidentally kill any of those orcs while you're up there, I wouldn't be terribly upset.28424Ner'gosh the Shadow is the leader of those warlocks to our north.  He's the jerk that kicked me out of my home once those Blackrock orcs started showing up.  Well, they're all jerks, but he's the jerkiest.If I'm ever going to move back in near the Altar, Ner'gosh has to go.28425Well I suppose I'm done with you here.  I'll go shoo those other warlocks out when I build up the courage.Here, don't forget those supplies.28426We're headed to Chiselgrip, right in the center of these steppes.  We'll rendezvous with the Thorium Brotherhood there, as well as with my father.Are you familiar with the Brotherhood?  Those dark iron dwarves have helped me out more than once.  We may need their help again.We'll pass through Black Tooth Hovel on our way there.  What do you say we kill a few of the Blackrock while we travel?  I'm getting a little restless here in this camp.28427Lok'tar, .  My name is Eitrigg, of the Argent Crusade... formerly of the Warchief's Honor Guard.  Before that, of the Blackrock orcs.I trust my son has briefed you on our plan.  He hasn't?  That is probably for the better.The next part of the plan is going to require a bit of subtlety.  Speak with Thelaron Direneedle, the tailor here in town.  I've already given him the hides and mud that you've collected.  He's going to need to size you.That's right, : you're going undercover.28428Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as an orc.  Their army is made mostly of orcs, so you'll fit right in.Do you know much about tailoring?  If not, then consider this your first lesson.  My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here.  Thelaron will fix you right up.28429Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as an ogre.  The firegut ogres have always worked for the Blackrocks, so you'll fit right in.Do you know much about tailoring?  If not, then consider this your first lesson.  My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here.  Thelaron will fix you right up.28430Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as a goblin.  The Blackrocks have been known to hire goblin mercenaries to fill their ranks, so you'll fit right in.Do you know much about tailoring?  If not, then consider this your first lesson.  My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here.  Thelaron will fix you right up.28431Judging by your weight, build, and size, we're going to dress you as a troll.

My crafting table over there has all the necessary supplies on it.Go ahead and grab whatever you think is necessary, then bring it here.  Thelaron will fix you right up.28432Undercover work is all about swagger.  Just act like you're supposed to be there, and you'll be fine.Your contact inside Black Tooth Hovel will be an orc by the name of Quartermaster Kaoshin.  He does NOT know you're a spy, so try and stay cool.  Do whatever he asks of you.Place this device in your ear.  I will be in touch to give you any special instructions.Good luck out there, soldier.28433Bah!  You're lucky I'm short-handed today.  Otherwise I'd make you my personal whipping  for the week.The officers and high-ranking soldiers need their boots polished.  They've left them out in front of their huts.I want to see my reflection in those boots, grunt!  Get to work!28434?  It's Eitrigg.We've just received the final bit of information for your next mission.  There are three marks that we'd like you to take down.  The first is Voodooist Timan, whom you'll find atop the Pillar of Ash.  Worgmistress Othana is in the central worg pens.  Finally, Gorlop is near the lava pools to the south.You will find the scorpid barbs you harvested packed along with your belongings.  Use the barbs on the marks when the time is right.28435Alright, I've got some actual, legitimate, important work for you.  We've got to call the kodos in from the grazing lands to the south.  General Thorg'izog says we'll be moving out into Redridge soon, and I won't be caught with my kodos down.Use this horn near a kodo.  It will return to the camp when it hears the call.You'll want to watch out.  Sometimes the kodos get a little feisty, so you need to knock them around a bit before they listen to you.28436, it's Eitrigg.  I want you to hold onto that horn.  I'm sure we can improvise and find a way to work it into the plan.I'm more than a little concerned about what Kaoshin said about attacking Redridge.  We knew an attack was imminent, but not this soon!Return to me, with the horn.  We will talk again here, in Chiselgrip.  And try not to ruin that disguise.  You're not done with your undercover work yet.28437Kaoshin turned out to be more helpful than I expected, but we're done with him.  It's time you spoke with the General.  I think you're ready.General Thorg'izog is one of the \"Big Three\" that run the Blackrock forces here in Burning Steppes.  He leads from the Blackrock Stronghold to the northwest.  Put on your disguise and go speak with him.  See if you can earn his trust.  I will be in touch, should I need anything further.28438I suppose I'll make the most of this situation.  These goblin mercenaries brought this enormous fire elemental to my stronghold as a \"thank you\" for hiring them.  What am I going to do with an elemental here in the steppes?  That's like bringing sand to the beach.If you're looking for work, then prove yourself.  Talk to this goblin here, and challenge his elemental to a fight.  The victor earns my respect, and my time.28439I've been looking for a good, strong soldier like you.  I need someone to keep my troops in line.Outside the stronghold, you will find orcs, ogres, and trolls preparing for the assault on Redridge.  My sergeants keep them in line, but I'd like you to assist them.Take this cudgel and discipline a few of my soldiers.  I don't care if they're misbehaving or standing perfectly in line, I want them beaten.  I want them focused, battle-hardened, and obedient.Now go.28440?  Eitrigg here.It sounds like you have earned Thorg'izog's trust, and he's assigned you to discipline duty.  This is fortunate.We need you to take out his sergeants.  You'll find them on wolfback, outside of the Blackrock Stronghold in the Fields of Honor.  Use that cudgel on them, several times, until they die.  You'll have to act fast, because if they realize you're not one of them, they can unmask you.  Strike quickly and ferociously, .28441We do not have any further strategic need for Thorg'izog or the Blackrock ground troops.  We must continue to the next phase of the plan.When you are finished at the stronghold, return to my son and me, here in Chiselgrip.28442Our work here in Chiselgrip is done, mostly thanks to you.  We'll now be moving on to the northeast, to Flame Crest.Flame Crest is in the cliffs, past the Ruins of Thaurissan.  It should serve as a sufficient base of operations for the final stages of our plan.Of course, my son Ariok will be joining you on the road.  As will I.28443I need you to do some more gathering before we can go take out the remainder of the Blackrock army.  If we're going to do this, we're going to do it right, and that means being prepared.I need ash, .  Not just any ash... ash from the greater obsidian elementals that roam the plains to the southeast.  The stuff is deep, deep black, which is what we need for our next disguise.Don't worry, you've already got a disguise.  This one is for someone... well, someTHING... else.28444The lava beds nearby - to the south - play host to flamekin, a brand of fire demon that has long roamed the steppes.  Situations are such in the Blackrock army that, if we are careful, we may be able to sneak some of these flamekin behind enemy lines to cause some havoc.Bring me the bodies of several flamekin.  As demons, they are easily resurrected, and then we can use them for our own purposes.28445We're going to need fresh meat, which means you're going to be hunting worg.  The worg on this side of the steppes should be your target.Hunt the giant ember worgs.  Once you've killed them, use this saw to remove the choicest bits of meat from their bodies.  You will find these worgs all over the steppes, but the closest pack rules the land just to our southeast.28446My legs are getting a little restless again.  You interested in taking a little tour, ?We're going to take a trip around Dreadmaul Rock.  I'd like to investigate some of the Blackrock army before we make our move, and I figure we might as well kill some of them while we're on the way.28447The Blackrock orcs don't come alone.  You've already seen that they've got the Firegut ogres and Smolderthorn trolls on their side.  Unfortunately for us, they're also teamed up with the black dragonflight.The orcs and the dragons have already sent some of their champions to stand guard at rally points, which are marked by a dragon skull on a pike.  You and I are going to find these rally points and take out this vanguard before the battle starts.Ready?28448While we are circling around Dreadmaul Rock, there's one more stop that we need to make.You remember the hatchlings that you freed from the Whelping Downs?  I've been watching over them, and now we're going to deliver them to someone who will take care of them better than we can.  He's staying in Slither Rock, to the northeast of Dreadmaul Rock.His name is Acride, and he might be the key to victory in the upcoming battle.28449.  It sounds like you and Ariok have finished with your tasks.  I've also finished mine.Return to Flame Crest.  I've prepared a few packages to deliver to the Big Three: Thorg'izog, Neeralak, and Xi'lun.  You've already met General Thorg'izog.  This will be your chance to meet the other two.That is, before you kill them.28450General Thorg'izog is staying among the ogres in the Firegut Furnace, a cave on the western edge of Dreadmaul Rock.  I'd like you to deliver this to him and the ogres.Inside this package, you will find the worg cutlets you obtained, marinated in the fel slider cider that we took from the Altar of Storms.I would avoid eating it if I were you.Bring it to General Thorg'izog.  He will make sure that his troops are fed and, with any luck, he will eat some himself.28451The warlocks of the Blackrock Clan often practice their magic in the Skull Warren, a cave on the eastern side of Dreadmaul Rock.  Their leader, Xi'lun, is busy elsewhere, so the cave is currently being held by another of the Big Three: Dragon-Lord Neeralak.  And Neeralak's expertise is in dragons, not in necromancy.I've used the slumber sand on those flamekin you captured.  Try to convince Neeralak that they're warlock imps, and not flamekin.  When they wake up, they won't be happy.28452Intel tells us that High Warlock Xi'lun - the final member of the Big Three - is within the cave atop Dreadmaul Peak, preparing for his big moment.He is waiting for a delivery: an Orb of Domination, with which he can perform a powerful summoning ritual.  I want you to give him this:This is the clear glass orb that you freed from the Altar of Storms.  It is powerless.  Give it to Xi'lun, and cross your fingers that he doesn't notice.28453, come in.  Can you read me?The battle is about to start.  I hope you've delivered all of those packages.I need you here in Flame Crest, NOW.28454This is it, .  A sad day... but a day in which the Blackrock orcs will learn a powerful lesson.  Today, our plan comes to fruition.Come with me.  We're going to go talk to Acride and call in that favor that he owes us.  Then we'll stop this invasion of Redridge before it even starts.28455You and my son are going back to that mountain.  There's three orcs who survived the attack, and we won't rest until they're dead.That's right, I'm talking about the Big Three.General Thorg'izog crawled back into the Firegut Furnace, and Dragon-Lord Neeralak is cowering in the cave on the mountain's peak.  Xi'lun is in the back of the Skull Warren, plotting with his fellow warlocks.Leave your mark, .  Topple these corrupt Blackrock orcs once and for all.28456While the Blackrock orcs still swarm in their spire, I doubt their plans will take them anywhere near the innocent people of Redridge anytime soon.  You and Ariok saw to that.I'd say we were fairly resourceful here in Burning Steppes - those warlock supplies we collected certainly came in handy, as did the obsidian ash that we used to conceal our dragon.There were, however, some collected items left over.  Please, take your pick before you move on, beyond the steppes.28457The Shattered Hand believes that the Dark Iron dwarves and Twilight's Hammer are working together. There's evidence that they are preparing a joint attack from within Blackrock Mountain. We can't allow such a force to depart Blackrock Mountain.You must go into Blackrock Depths and capture the Twilight's Hammer attack plans from General Angerforge in the West Garrison. Eliminate the elementals Twilight's Hammer has provided to support his forces.28458The power of the Dark Iron forces and their Twilight's Hammer allies is growing within Blackrock Mountain. Pyromancer Loregrain is a powerful and influential magus in the Twilight's Hammer delegation. If we could get our hands on his grimoire, I could develop counters for Twilight's Hammer spells and curses.You must descend into Blackrock Depths, locate the Shrine of Thaurissan, and capture the grimoire. Show Loregrain and his Twilight minions no mercy.28459The Shattered Hand has discovered increased collaboration between Twilight's Hammer and the Dark Iron dwarves in Blackrock Depths. We have an opportunity to strike at our enemies and empower ourselves, .Twilight's Hammer followers have placed a number of elemental binding stones throughout Shadowforge City, the Domicile, the Shrine of Thaurissan, the West Garrison and the East Garrison. Find and capture those stones!28460I came to Winterspring to investigate the Frostfire Hot Springs. I've noticed that the water seems to have... strange qualities. I haven't yet been able to discover the source, and to tell you the truth, I've had some difficulty lately, due to the Winterfall furbolg.They seem to be drawn to the springs, just as I am. They have become extremely protective of the water, and won't let me come near the two larger springs to the north of here.I'd like to continue my studies, so won't you help me?28461The Shattered Hand has discovered some disturbing information in Blackrock Depths. It appears Twilight's Hammer is working with the Dark Iron engineer, Argelmach, to create war golems powered by elementals. These golems could be a great advantage for our enemies.It is your duty to prevent that from happening. Find the Manufactory in Blackrock Depths, capture the blueprints he's using to make those golems, and recover the elemental modules he's using to power them.28462This vial that you picked up from the Winterfall furbolg is empty, but you can detect a few drops of a strange green liquid inside; it almost glows.Is it something important?Donova Snowden would probably be able to tell you more, since she has been camped by the hot springs in Winterspring for some time now.28463As a member of the Shattered Hand, you know that it is our job to watch the Horde's enemies. We have discovered that the Dark Iron dwarves and their new allies, Twilight's Hammer, are preparing to attack.I'm sending you to help deal with this threat before the Dark Iron army marches. Take this poison and apply it to the soldiers' rations of grain in Blackrock Depths.The rations for most of the Dark Iron army are kept in the East and West Garrison of Blackrock Depths.28464The aggression of the Winterfall furbolg has to have its source somewhere. I'd like to get to the bottom of it if I can!I've seen the furbolg in the camps to the north brewing something in a cauldron. They seemed very protective of it... if whatever they're cooking up is what's causing this, I must examine it myself.Find that cauldron if it's still there, and bring me back what's inside!28465Within the halls of Blackrock Depths, the Twilight's Hammer cult and the Dark Iron dwarves are gathering their forces. Backing up their legions are hordes of fire elementals bound to the service of the firelord, Ragnaros.If we can free those elementals from their bonds, we can both weaken our enemies and honor the elements. Take this totem with you and use it on subdued fireguards. It will free their spirits from their bondage and restore them to their natural state.28466Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now the Shattered Hand has discovered that the Dark Irons and Twilight's Hammer are increasing their collaboration. Using the cult's knowledge, the Dark Iron dwarves are imbuing their weapons with elemental powers. They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.28467The greenish substance inside the cauldron is putrid and viscous.  No matter what it is, it doesn't seem to be good.It would be best to report back to Donova with your findings, along with a sample of the liquid in the cauldron.28469Very interesting, ...When this toxic substance is mixed with the water from the hot springs, it loses its toxicity, only retaining the ability to temporarily affect those that ingest it. This must be why the Winterfall protect the hot springs so fervently -- they need them to purify their firewater.We need to stop this -- cut off contact between the Winterfall and the Deadwood. A group of runners walks the distance between their village and Felwood. Find and defeat them, and steal their shipment.28470The Winterfall furbolg are not a normally aggressive tribe, and this change in their behavior leads me to think that they must be under orders from their chief. We most likely can't undo the damage that has already been done, but if their leader is slain, they may not get any worse.Head east again, past where you found that cauldron. High Chief Winterfall is here, at the easternmost part of Timbermaw Post.28471The log you found on the high chief looks extensive, but after looking through a couple of the pages, you find that you cannot read the text. The markings are so crude and poorly-formed that you are not sure if anyone would be able to read them.But perhaps Donova will be able to tell you what it says...28472The Winterfall are no longer a threat to me, but if you still want to find out what was driving the furbolg to create and consume this strange firewater, I think you should seek out Kelek Skykeeper.He's a druid that once worked to help cleanse Felwood with the Emerald Circle, and has since come here to study the nearby ruins.You might be able to find him to the east at Lake Kel'theril, where he spends his time recently.28473Blackrock Depths has long been home to our enemies, but now the Shattered Hand has discovered that the Dark Irons and Twilight's Hammer are increasing their collaboration.

They've outfitted the Anvilrage legion with these fearsome new weapons.I want you to go into Blackrock Depths and gather the weapons from the Anvilrage dwarves there and break them over the Black Anvil in the heart of Shadowforge City.28474The influence of Twilight's Hammer grows within Blackrock Depths. They have allied with the Dark Iron dwarves and seek to convince them to strike outside the mountain.We must destroy the instruments of the Twilight's Hammer agitation. Their influence over the Dark Irons must be minimized.I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.28475In Blackrock Depths, Twilight's Hammer has started to persuade the Dark Irons to strengthen their alliance and prepare their armies for a campaign outside the mountain.We must not allow this manipulation to create a combined Dark Iron-Twilight's Hammer force! We must destroy the tools of the cult's persuasion.I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.28476In Blackrock Depths, Twilight's Hammer has started to persuade the Dark Irons to strengthen their alliance and wage a campaign of conquest.We have to act before the cultists can whip up the bloodlust in the Dark Irons and their leadership. Perhaps the best way to deal with this is to destroy the material the cultists are distributing to the dwarves.I want you to go into Domicile portion of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn the books that the Twilight's Hammer is distributing there.28477Our enemies be plottin' against us in the halls of Blackrock Depths. The Twilight's Hammer cultists, they be busy preaching and handin' out books to the Dark Irons, tellin' them that it's time for war. Wit' a Dark Iron army at their backs, the Twilight's Hammer be a formidable force. We must put an end to the agitation!I be wantin' you to go into Domicile of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn those Twilight's Hammer books!28478It wasn't enough for their master to break the world, no! Twilight's Hammer is doing its best to unite our enemies against us, particularly in Blackrock Depths. They've got a whole team of emissaries down there spreading propaganda aimed at starting a joint campaign.I've always heard that the medium's the message. Well, it's time to destroy the message!I want you to go into the Domicile of Blackrock Depths and use this torch to burn those Twilight's Hammer books!28479At this lake, the Crystal of Zin-Malor was stolen by the Highborne. The crystal was a powerful artifact that bent arcane magic in wild and unpredictable ways... but it could only be held by the worthy, and brought doom upon all others.The spirits that wander here span generations, each shackled here by Zin-Malor. Some will speak and tell their fates.Should you wish to learn the fate of Zin-Malor, seek the spirit at the center of the lake...28480The armies of Ramkahen are getting obliterated by Neferset's immortal guardians.The only way to defeat them is to slay the Dark Pharaoh of Neferset.Before we make our move, however, we're going to need to take care of his lieutenants.Go behind the battle-lines and slay Scorpion-Lord Namkhare and High Priest Sekhemet.  Only then will we be ready to confront the Dark Pharaoh himself.28482Jonesy tells me you two need to make it up that mountain.Well, you're not going far with those troopers crawling all over it like ants on a carcass.Some of my friends were able to confiscate a bit of the enemy's hardware. It should make your journey a bit easier.Make your way up the ridgeline to the north, and you'll find it waiting for you.Good luck, you two!28483I will not lie to you, .  We face a tremendous challenge ahead of us.As you go behind the enemy lines into Neferset City, I want you to bring back the insignia of any Neferset scum you defeat.It will be a boon to our armies to know that you've dealt a crushing blow to the enemy.28484The magus has been idle for far too long and an idle magus often leads to poorly thought out schemes. This time I am charged with collecting various beast organs in order to power some type of control rod. I am far too frail to go out hunting beasts - especially yetis!Perhaps if I were to offer you a reward of some kind you would do it? All I need is for you to head west to the yeti caves and kill yetis. Rip their still beating hearts from their chests and bring them back here.28485For years the mountain yeti of this region have been allowed free reign. Our complacency in dealing with the yeti menace has resulted in an aberration! Yetimus, lord of all yetis, has grown to a size and strength that our guard simply cannot handle. We fear that should his appetite lead him near Tarren Mill he would devour us all.Gather a party of suitable adventurers and dispatch the beast. He roams the countryside to the west.Bring me one of his horns and I will reward you handsomely.28486Neferset City is too well defended.  The mountain next to it, however, is not.I've spoken to the ranger captain and he's willing to take a handful of his men and secure the strategic mountaintop.There is one catch, .  He agreed, but only if you would spearhead the attack with them.It must be a small group, else we'll draw the enemy's attention too soon, but trust me... the rangers of Ramkahen are as tough as they come.  With you by their side we'll surely succeed.28487So this is pretty embarrassing. Where to begin?Well, you see, Melisara sent me to investigate the yeti menace in the nearby caves, west of here. It was getting late and my armor was weighing heavily on me. I took my gear off and decided to take a stroll. Yes, I, erm, went for a walk. Anyway, when I returned I discovered that my gear had been stolen! It was the yetis. I'm sure of it. They took my pants, sword and helm and ran off into their cave. Get them back for me and I will reward you.28488Among the other precious gemstones hidden deep out of our reach in the Crumbling Depths, there are enormous ruby crystal clusters. They are infused with terrible energy.It will not be easy to obtain such a thing, for they are well guarded. But you, you are stubborn and brave. I think this is something you can do.Within the Crumbling Depths, look to where the tunnels end abruptly in stone. The clusters are found in those passages when they are to be found at all. Should you find one, return to me.28489Ever had a stagwich? Me neither. Apparently they're delicious. Now I'm not one for eating, but I am a businessman. If my customers want stagwiches, who am I to argue?You're probably asking yourself, \"What does this have to do with me?\" I'll tell you what, , I need stag meat! You get me stag meat from the hill stags of Hillsbrad and I will pay you. Sounds like a pretty good deal, doesn't it?Get going! Stags are most plentiful to the west.28490By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Priestess Dentaria at Lor'danel in Darkshore.The people of Lor'danel need your aid in caring for the survivors of Auberdine's destruction and securing their town against Twilight's Hammer.

I guess the Burning Steppes weren't INTERESTING enough for them.Not me, though.  I'm always finding new reasons to not leave, and the latest happens to be the flameflies that have been appearing lately.They appear near lava during the day.

That hill is crawling with troopers!Jump on and paint our targets for me.Make every shot count, ! We need to be able to get up there.28498There is an old story about Nahom.  It speaks of how a powerful prophet named Atulhet held off troves of enemies by channeling the power of the sun through this very temple.Most believe the tale to be just a legend, but that power... would certainly be useful to us now.The vile Neferset have ransacked Atulhet's tomb.  They've taken any artifacts of power and shattered the tablets that encode his memories.Go to the Tombs of the Precursors to the east and retrieve any fragments that you find.28499We, priests of Nahom, are guardians of the Tombs of the Precursors.Ever since the Neferset turned to their new masters, they've turned to great heresies.They rob the sacred tombs of our forefathers, seeking powerful artifacts and destroying invaluable relics in the process.Go to the tombs, east of here and punish the tomb-robbers for their transgressions, lest they join their brethren when the Neferset attack on Nahom begins.28500It's all right here, .  Atulhet built a potent weapon into this temple and the only way to access it is with the correct cypher.It is reportedly hidden in the Keset Pass.  We must hope the Neferset looters haven't gotten to it yet.  That's where Raider Lord Havat is operating and he's the most ruthless of the lot.But without reinforcements, this might be our only hope for defending Nahom.28501The enemy is coming... and in great numbers.We will get no further reinforcements.

You will find the Neferset are performing a foul ritual of corruption.Stop them so the river is cleansed once again.28612After all we've been through, it looks like everything's actually coming together!We're just steps away from the coffer... I've researched the codes to reveal it... Schnottz thinks we're dead....You know, we might just pull this off after all!28613Alright, . We've bought ourselves a little breathing room, but there's no time to lose.Follow me!28614High Chieftain Winterfall's absence has done little to quell the rage of the Winterfall. In his absence, their greatest warrior has rose to a position of terrible power.Grolnar the Berserk lurks in the cave at the top of Winterfall Village, gorged on enough corrupt firewater to kill ten lesser furbolgs.He has become a bloated and horrible beast! Our warriors have been unable to face him... do you have the strength to defeat him, ?28615Despite their corruption and madness, the Winterfall barely cling to their shamanic powers. It disturbs me to see the power of the elements used by them to harm my tribe and other innocents.We will turn their totems against them! Take my own totem with you into Winterfall Village. Use its powers on the Winterfall's totems from afar, and the fury of the earth will be unleashed on all nearby!Needless to say... keep a safe distance!28616Before we continue, let us have a moment of silence for our fallen brother, Orkus, for without him, we would have been destroyed by the Stormpike onslaught. This is for you, brother!Now, , do not think that I forgot your part in all of this! That is why you get the honors of detonating the goblin pocket-nukes.Are you ready? FOR THE HORDE!28617You know how to use the spitters, but did you know that if you use a sunflower you can grow things faster? We'll grow some sunflowers and then we'll plant some spitters to push back Warden Stillwater's crazed monstrosities.Let's go!28618Here you go, as promised! One Boulder-in-a-Box.Lilith was asking for this, wasn't she? She's my only customer!28619All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Dark Ranger Alina at Galen's Fall. The Dark Lady's forces need your help to expand the dominions of the Horde and drive back the Alliance interlopers.To reach the Arathi Highlands, travel east from Hillsbrad Foothills and follow the road past Thoradin's Wall.Destiny calls!28620Our outpost in the southeast is having some problems. I don't have any details other than... well, let me just read from the latest letter:\"The orcs have grown petulant. Send help or I will have them beaten with reeds.\"That's it. It was sent from our chief psylosopher, Nils Beerot. Yea, I have no idea what that means either. Could you please head to Eastpoint Tower and find out what he needs? I can't take any more of these cryptic letters!Just head south and then follow the road east.28621Och!You an' junior took yer sweet time gettin'  'ere, din't ya!?, takin' in the sights, I'll wager.Don't go breakin' yer arm pattin' yerself on the back now, the real work's just beginnin'!There be more ta this ancient artifact than ye know, but in order ta reveal its secrets, we need ta get it to the Cradle of the Ancients!Now howdya spose we do that?Maybe junior over there has some bright ideas, eh?28622I had planned on bringing the coffer back to my lab for study, but it seems Brann here has different ideas.He thinks he knows how to put a stop to Deathwing's plans here in Uldum.My buddy, Jock, is standing by with the transport, just waiting for our signal.Take these flares and plant them around the perimeter to let him know that we're ready.28623Our work is done here, .  Against all odds, we stopped the Neferset advance on Nahom.Let us join the forces pushing west, lest they take all the glory for themselves.They must've reached the outskirts of Neferset City by now.28624Pah! Crude and clumsy is all I see!You need more than just strength. My axes are just as strong as Lilith's maces, but so sharp, I can cut through a tree in one chop!You heard me, one chop! I'll prove it, too, here in front of everyone. Go ask Deez if he can get a tree in here!28625I deal in small timber plenty, but full trees? That's a novelty item. Kinda like those boulders.Maybe you can do me another favor. Just west of town there's a grove of trees overlooking Lake Kel'theril. I don't know if it's the spooks there, or all that elf magic junk strewn around the place, but we've been getting treants and lashers wandering around there recently.They're making it a real pain to chop wood over there, so why don't you chop some of them? Bring the wood from the treants back here.28626Here you go, one instant Super-Gro Insta-Tree made with 80% natural ingredients!No roots, no muss, no fuss. Just give it to Kilram and make sure he stands the heck back when he uses it.28627Brutes and amateurs.It doesn't matter how sharp or heavy your weapon is if all it's good for is hacking like an ogre. I could go on and on about finesse and speed and balance and control... but it's easier to one-up these fools.Tell Deez we've got one more order for him. I need a block of ice.28628Alright, one high-quality, pure grade Instant Ice Block!I tried selling these to people for protection for a while. Y'know, like that trick you see mages pull? Couldn't figure out the whole \"breathing\" thing, though.28629My friends are always coming up with great ideas. I've never felt like I could match them... until today! I just drew up the plans for something great! If you promise not to tell, I'll let you in on the secret... I'm going to make a mechanical yeti! Not only are my friends sure to be freaked out when they see it, but when they get over that, I know they'll be impressed!I need thick yeti fur from the Ice Thistle yeti. There's plenty of them in the Ice Thistle Hills to the southeast.28630A lot of goblins have been going missing out there in Ice Thistle Hills. I was almost one of them!I had the idea to set up a sensor to tell us when the yeti were getting close to Everlook. Of course, it's not working either. There's yeti all over the hills and I haven't heard a peep from it.Would you mind checking on it for me? It might still be fixable. Echo Three's set up to the southeast on the edge of Ice Thistle Hills. Don't ask what happened to Echo One and Two.28631I can't make a yeti without horns!I've been looking for what seems like forever for the perfect set of horns... and no horn I find is good enough! But just the other day I saw the biggest yeti in Winterspring.I named him Icewhomp. His horns are the ones I've been looking for! He lurks all the way in the back of the cave along the eastern ridge of Ice Thistle Hills.Bring me his horns... but be sure to check on Echo Three along the way!28632Ice this time? Hoo boy, sure. I've got good news and bad news for you.The good news is there's a bunch of pure solid ice over in the Ice Thistle Hills cavern, straight east from Everlook. The bad news is there's also a bunch of vicious yetis in there.But if you can handle the yeti, hey, piece of cake! Just walk right up to the bigger chunks and crack 'em open with your weapon. Bring it all back to me and I'll do my thing.28633I'm not quite certain what ta expect 'ere, so stay on yer toes, eh?These codes should reveal the coffer's true purpose, and present us with the tools to thwart Deathwing's efforts in Uldum fer good!Stand back!28634Owlbeasts... Soulless, feathered monstrosities sent from the darkest depths of the Twisting Nether to prey upon the weak.They surround us on all sides and they are planning an attack - I can sense it. You must stop them before they can organize.I want you to head into the forest and kill every owlbeast that you see. NONE SHOULD SURVIVE!28635The battle over Dun Garok was the bloodiest of all the Hillsbrad battles. The dwarves, outnumbered ten-to-one, fought until the bitter end. Every last one of 'em died in defense of that piece of land.Now I hear claims that the place is haunted. Nobody wants to go near it! Unfortunately I have orders to prepare Dun Garok for habitation.Could you do me a favor and go to Dun Garok and search for evidence of a haunting? It's far to the southeast.28636The spirits of my soldiers haunt this fort now, . Their souls are now bound to this place. Even in death they continue to fight for it. 'Tis sad.Put 'em out o' their misery and perhaps ye shall have the spoils of yer people's victory.28637Have you ever had the luxury of trying bear meat? I never had the chance to try it in Gilneas, but the bears here are simply exquisite.The shardtooth bears that roam just to the south are well-marbled with fat from the cold here. I've been hunting them myself, and it's quite a lark, but I much prefer eating them!I recommend you try your hand at the hunt. Stick to the white-pelted Shardtooth bears, and the Captain will go to field to bring back any you kill.28638I've been eatin' owls my whole life. Owls is good eatin', and my friend Jez agrees. I was the first one that told him to sell owl!Mister fancy-pants worgen here says bears taste better, but don't pay him no mind. You should go hunt yourself some owl. There's plenty of 'em wandering just south of here. Stick to the gray ones for now, an' buzz me on the little talky-thing Jez gave you when you've racked up a few.28639I've heard it said that you are what you eat. I don't know if I believe that, but if it's true... I'd prefer to eat the strongest creature that I can find.Ursius is the largest bear in Winterspring. He eats first when his pack of shardtooth brings down a chimaera or an owlbear. He claims the most comfortable cave in the shardtooth-held lands. And he has... considerable influence with the shardtooth females.He is my kind of bear.I want to eat him.His cave is near the maulers. Good luck!28640Doesn't that smell great? My smoked meats get top dollar, and nobody else provides the exotic flavors I've got out here in the hills. And it's efficient; you just do the hunting for a small fee, and my other fine friends drag the beasts back here for skinnin' and smokin'!I've got the market cornered on Frostsaber meat right now. Absolutely delicious stuff, makes great sausages. Head out and hunt those cats just west of here, and we'll call that a start!28641Alright kid, time to head out further into the field!This haul's nice and good, but further to the west you'll find much bigger kitties. The pride watchers and huntresses have a lot more muscle on them, and it makes AMAZING burger patties. They sell like crazy!Gimme a ping when you've cleared house and we'll see about you going after the main course.28643Durnholde Keep has always been a place of strife. For years the humans used it as an internment camp and prison for the orcs. After that it was taken over by the Syndicate. Now? The Dark Lady captured and placed powerful elementals within its walls. She charged me with administering \"The Durnholde Challenge.\" Any that can defeat all of the elementals will earn a grand prize!

The fearsome elemental can be found on the lower level of Durnholde Keep, near the western prisons.28646According to the guide, Infernus is your next challenge. This being, made of molten lava and raging fire, can be found on the lower level of Durnholde Keep, near the eastern prisons.28647Imprisoned in the old Durnholde Keep arena is a being comprised of pure mercury. The Forsaken have dubbed it the D-1000. Kill the D-1000 and claim your prize!28649We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house. We weren't expecting what we found in there, . Seems the Crusade's been real busy. That whole thing is full of Argent Dawn prisoners. Most of them were already dead by the time we arrived, but a few were still breathing.I was about to go in there and execute the rest of them, but I think you should have the honors. In particular, there's a real feisty worgen in there that I think you'll take great pleasure in executing.28650We got here, tore the place apart, and headed toward the prison house.

She serves Shadow Priest Sarvis, and will probably have some tasks to which you can apply your new abilities.28652I am done with you.  There are, however, others who can use your aid.Caretaker Caice, standing on that stump behind me, can probably give you another assignment.  You should speak with him now.28653Are you still here, ?  You know, I'm only a deathguard.  I don't have many tasks I can hand out to passers-by like you.I'd recommend that you talk to Shadow Priest Sarvis.  I remember, he helped me get on my feet after I was plucked out of that tomb.  I'm sure he'll do the same for you.You'll find him just inside the chapel, here on the west side of town.28654Well, , half of me wishes I could stick around a while and take in the sights with ye.I've seen some mighty amazin' things in my day, but this here takes the cake.Sadly, I have a fair bit o' research ta do on these discs before I make my way into the Halls of Origination.You seem ta be worth your salt, perhaps ye'd like ta tag along and see how a REAL archaeologist works, eh?28655We are ready to begin, !But I have it on good authority that the Twilight's Hammer may try to disrupt the ceremony, so as to demoralize and destroy the Wildhammer.

Good!Since her father is dead and her brother the best man, Fanny has asked that you walk her down the aisle. What an honor! Talk to me when you're ready to begin.28656When this creature died, some sort of energy was released from its body. The energy was passed on to you, and now you feel somewhat stronger.According to Winterspring locals, Witch Doctor Mau'ari at the Snowden Chalet is an expert in the wildlife of the area. She might know something about this mysterious energy.28657We finally capture this godforsaken rock and then we find out that there is a huge ettin roaming around, taking out our sentry patrols!, I need you to round up a few friends and take that ettin down.  We can't have a beast like that roaming around, wreaking havoc.Stay alert, reports from the front say that he is carrying a huge tree as a weapon, and he is not afraid to use it.28658Supplies are never easy to find in a place like this, .  We have been scouting since we captured the island but things are not looking good.Fortunately, we just  received a scouting report that a swamp full of crocs is just west of our base camp here.  The hides off those crocs will come in handy for our leatherworkers.  Bring back as many as you can.28659We fought hard to capture this island, .  We cleared out most of the Alliance filth but I can still smell their foul stench in the air.I need you to investigate the slagworks, warden's vigil and the ironclad garrison.  Kill any Alliance that you find.You know what they say, the only good Alliance is a dead Alliance!28660You are a sight for sore eyes, .  Now that we have claimed tol barad, the battle has just begun.We discovered a cell block just east of here that we need you to clear out.  Turns out that its chock full of ghosts that have been locked up down there for who knows how long.Clear out as much as you can and report back to me when you are done.28661We have been trying to clear out the Cursed Depths cellblock since we landed on Tol Barad.  It seems that everytime we get close, that archmage shows up and pushes us back.Now that we have claimed the island, it's time we take another shot.  Head down there and bring me back his staff as proof that you have finished the job.28662Now that we finally have a hold on this wretched island, we can start to investigate how it got in this condition.  Some of our troops have discovered journals around the entrance to Cursed Depths cellblock just east of here.These journals are of particular interest to our elder scribes back at base camp.  I need you to recover four of them and bring them back to me as fast as you can., be careful down there, that place is crawling with undead.28663Have you heard of the D-Block yet ?  It's one of the old cellblocks here on the island.  Problem is, it's infested with demons.  We planned on using it to lock up the leftover Alliance we found on the island, but that is not going to happen in its current state.I need you to head down there and clear those demons out.  Report back to me when you are done.28664Excellent work on the island capture, .  Now that we have claimed the island, we need to make these cellblocks useable for prisoners.  D-Block has been especially hard to clear out.  Unfortunately it has become overrun with demons of all sorts.We have been able to thin out the demons but a large core hound has broken its way out of its cell and is wreaking havoc down there.  I need you to kill him and bring back his collar.28665Have you been down in the D-Block yet, ?  Every time we clear that infested cellblock out, the demons seem to return rather quickly.

Report back to me when you are done.28669We have almost finished clearing out the revolting prisoners in the hole, but one last problem remains.  The warden.Warden Silva is their master and they will do anything for him.  If we take him out, we take them all out.  Finish him off and bring me back his keys.  We can use those keys to explore deeper into the cellblock and possibly gain access to the water supply here on the island.28670Supplies are running low here in camp, .

Half of our supply ships end up on the rocks down there.To make matters worse, it's been overrun by a gang of undead sailors.  We have tried thinning the ranks, but they just seem to keep coming back.  Our last resort is to try and take out the captain that they report to.  You should be able to find him on a ship, just off the shoreline.Oh, and I hope you are not too scared of sharks.28679We have been having issues with the undead down at the Cape of Lost Hope for a while now.  Every time a new ship wrecks, they end up getting more undead to join their ranks.Can you do us a favor and thin out the ranks up there?  I know you won't be able to kill them all, but anything you can do will help at this point.Keep an eye out for alliance, we have been getting reports of them ambushing the beach lately.28680Morale is low these days, .

We sent a small group to investigate and they reported back on his exact position within the keep.Can you finish him off for us?28683We have been trying to get a foothold in The Darkwood for weeks now but that forest is infested with spiders.  Do me a favor and see if you can thin them out enough for us to set up an attack.Careful out there, I have heard reports of Alliance troops nearby earlier in the week.28684Finding supplies on the island has been difficult, to say the least.Fortunately, we have found a good supply of silk in The Darkwood, just north of here.  The bad part of this story is that the silk comes from the glands on Broodmother spiders.  I need you to gather 4 of these for me.That should be just enough to finish up this last set of shirts.28685Battle supplies are hard to come by on this rock.  Every time we hold off another Alliance attack, it feels like we are fighting with sticks and stones.Reports have come in that Keep Lord Farson on the north side of the island has a large stockpile of rifles that we could use.  Can you head down there and check it out?Be careful , Farson's followers will do anything to protect him.28686Have you been up to Rustberg Village yet ?  I would suggest you bring a sharpened blade if you are heading that direction.The folks in that town look alright but something suspicious is going on in there.

That place is a curse and a blessing for us, .  I have no clue where bandits learned to fish as well as they do but I have no time to worry about that now.I need you to head down there and steal as many of their fish reserves as possible.  We have been living off scraps since we retook the island and this is our best chance at some solid food reserves.Keep an eye out for stealthers up there, reports have told us they are prevalent inside the village walls.28688All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Commander Aggro'gosh at Grom'gol Base Camp. The commander requires your aid to keep the supply routes open and free of interference from the local inhabitants and the troublesome Alliance.To reach Grom'gol, you can take the zeppelin Orgrimmar's eastern zeppelin tower or the one near Undercity.Destiny calls!28689Many soldiers died on this island .  It is only fair that we pay our respects to them in any way that we can.I need you to travel to Forgotten Hill, due west of here and release our brothers in arms' tortured souls away from this place.  Do be careful over there, reports of undead have been ongoing in the area.28690Forgotten Hill has been overrun with zombies and ghouls ever since we reclaimed this wretched isle.  We have tried to clear them out many times but they always seem to come back.One of our lieutenants recommended taking the ghouls' bones when we kill them in hopes that they can't reincarnate overnight.  Think you can help us out with this one?28691The first time I heard about Lt. Connor, I was just a young recruit in Ragefire Chasm.  None of us could believe he ended up here on Tol Barad.  Sadly, he still roams these wretched islands, wreaking havoc on our troops morale.I need you to put an end to his misery... and ours.28692Getting useful machine parts out here on the island has been difficult, .  We have been trying to repair the broken siege engines here in camp but we keep running out of useful parts.Our second regiment reported some wrecked out siege engines in a old battlefield to the west.  Maybe we could find some parts over there?You are going to have trouble finding anything in that old battlefield so take this magnetized scrap collector and put it to some good use.28693We have been trying to collect useful scraps from the front all week.  Every time we gather a batch to bring back to camp, we get assaulted by the restless soldiers in the area.  Can you head over there and clear them out?28694Have you been over to the Wellson Shipyard yet, ?  Best to stay away from there unless you have a good reason to venture in.  Unfortunately, that is exactly what I need you to do.You see, we have been short on supplies ever since we recaptured the island.  That ghost ridden shipyard is overflowing with lumber but every time we send an escort to recover the lumber, they never make it back.Can you help us out?28695Foreman Wellson has been a pain in our side since we got here.  His shipyard holds a large amount of supplies that would be extremely useful to us... if we could get to them.He keeps a close watch over his minions and makes it very difficult for us to get a foothold on the shipyard.  I need you to take out Wellson for good this time.  Be careful , we have been receiving reports of dirty Alliance all around the area.28696The Wellson Shipyard is constantly receiving supplies from offshore and we need to put a stop to it.  They have setup cannons along the docks for defense but if you can make it to them, we can use them to destroy their supply ships.Head down there and see what you can do.  Report back to me on your progress.28697See that hill with the towers to the northeast?  That's Largo's Overlook and it's not a fun place to set up camp next to.  We have been dealing with those spirits and spectres ever since we setup camp.Can you head up there and let them know we don't plan on leaving anytime soon?  A few good kills on their ranks should put them in line.Thanks for your help on this, .28698Largo and his minions have been stealing our supplies ever since we setup camp here.  It's frustrating to say the least.We have heard reports that he is stockpiling cannonballs in the towers overlooking the water up on his overlook.  Can you head up there and try to recover some of them for us?, don't forget to keep a watch out for Alliance too.28699By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Lieutenant Doren at the Rebel Camp.Years after Colonel Kurzen's treachery against Stormwind, the truth of what happened remains a mystery.

Largo is pretty paranoid these days so you should be able to find him on top of the tower, looking for his imaginary navy to finally arrive.28701Luckily, when the infestation occured, no druids were slumbering in the western barrow den. It is still a sacred site to us, however, and its depths hold blessed relics kept there undisturbed for ages.While I am somewhat trusting of the goblin exterminators, I am also... familiar with the habits of their race. Please retrieve any relics you can find in the barrow den and bring them back to me so they are not damaged. They are within urns, nestled in the small alcoves throughout the den.28702By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to Bronwyn Hewstrike at the Explorers' League Digsite.The Explorers' League expedition needs your help to safeguard its site and findings from marauding ogres.

She requires your help to deal with the pirates and naga who have overrun the jungle.Travel to Hardwrench Hideaway by heading south from Northern Stranglethorn and looking for the town southwest of the Gurubashi Arena.Destiny calls!28705All able bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Lieutenant General Orion at the Stair of Destiny.Your skills are needed to fight the Burning Legion's presence on the shattered remnants of Outland.Go to Orgrimmar's Cleft of Shadow and use the portal near the mage trainers to reach the Blasted Lands, then travel through the Dark Portal itself to reach Hellfire Peninsula.Destiny calls!28706My fellow siblings are already further down in the den trying to deal with these bugs, and they're starting to get overwhelmed. I say it's time to gas the place.Take these fumigators. Don't go setting them off yourself; it takes a highly trained professional, and proper timing. Just find my sisters and pass them out.Remma should be positioned closest to the entrance.

I wish we could meet in more favorable circumstances. The world hangs by a thread, and all that the Titans have wrought may be in jeopardy.It saddens me greatly, but my judgment is final. Deathwing - the horrific creature that was once the Earth Warder and once my friend - must be destroyed.I have prepared a site atop the Highlands, to the west of the Vermillion Redoubt, where I can bring about his end. Seek out the Circle of Life and speak with Lirastrasza within. I will join you there.28713Greetings, . I am Ilthalaine. My purpose in Shadowglen is to train young s like you and to ensure that the balance of nature is maintained.The spring rains were particularly heavy this year, causing some of the forest's beasts to flourish while others suffered. Unfortunately, the nightsaber numbers grew too large, and they will devastate the other populations if they are not culled.Journey forth, young , and thin saber populations so that nature's harmony will be preserved.28714You seem to know what you're doing. Perhaps I can task you with something a little more important.As you may well know, the corruption in Teldrassil was supposedly wiped away. Yet something lingers. The creatures have not calmed and all manner of problems still plague us.I need you to deal with the grellkin that have gathered to the west, and while you're there, I want you to search them for fel moss. This will help me determine from where this continuing corruption stems.28715Vicious little grell! They've been stealing from our foodstores again.If you wouldn't mind lending a hand, they are sure to have my stolen bags within their camps to the west. I would be glad to reward you if you can bring them back to me.28716By order of his royal highness, King Varian Wrynn, all able-bodied citizens of the Alliance are to report to the throne room in Stormwind Keep.King Wrynn requires a trustworthy and proven hero for a mission of the utmost importance.Stormwind Keep can be found in the eastern portion of Stormwind City.For the glory and honor of the Alliance!28717All able-bodied members of the Horde are hereby ordered to report to Garrosh Hellscream in Grommash Hold.The Warchief requires your help to prepare for the glorious assault on the Twilight Highlands and our dual enemies, the Alliance and Twilight's Hammer.Meet with the Warchief in Grommash Hold at the center of Orgrimmar's Valley of Strength.Destiny calls!28718Say there, ... do you like meat?  Even better, do you like money?I got a second cousin who's making a killing in the frozen meats business.  He's set up a smoking pit up north, and he's looking for help hunting all the dangerous beasties that always tend to taste so good.Carnivores pay well, friend.  I'm too heavily invested here in this barrow den - what was I thinking? - so I might as well pass the tip on to a helpful  like yourself.His name's Jez.  Head northeast, and look for the smoke!28719Many find the meat of the Shardtooth bears to be too gamy for their taste. I disagree, though I'm not one to judge the tastes of others.The Shardtooth Maulers, however - their brown-furred cousins, to the south - have much more tender flesh, particularly in their paws. And I've heard that the snout is also considered a delicacy.Continue your hunt, . Let's see if you can bag those maulers for ol' Francis.28721We have sent at least 3 different recon groups to investigate Farson Hold in the last few weeks.  Sadly, not one of them has returned back with any info.At this point, all we can hope is that they are being held alive as prisoners.  I need you to infiltrate the keep and help get our soldiers back.  This won't be easy , but if anyone can help us, it's you.28722It's all ready, !Now, I told my friend Legacki that I have a surprise for her. This is where you come in!I'm going to give you my mechanical yeti, and you'll get the honor of using it to surprise her. She's just on the other side of Everlook, near the inn.Go up to her and turn the yeti on... I'll be watching from here!28723Now that you're practiced in your new ability, perhaps you'd be willing to aid us in further pursuing the corruption haunting Shadowglen.Dentaria Silverglade, Priestess of the Moon, has offered to aid us. You should find her between the two pools just north of our great tree. Circle around the tree to reach her and offer her any help that you can, young .28724Our friend Iverron has fallen to poison from the nearby webwood spiders. I can tend to him to keep his state from deteriorating, but I need someone to gather an ingredient to prepare him an antidote.All around the ponds you should find Moonpetal Lilies. These flowers have great healing properties, and I can use them with the ingredients I already have to restore Iverron to better health.Would you gather them for me?  There should be many just in sight of here, near the water's edge.28725I must ask something more dangerous of you. Strange news has traveled to me through the whisperings of the forest spirits. The mysterious woodland protector, Tarindrella, has returned to Shadowglen again.The dryad's presence has not been felt in the forests since before the blessing of Teldrassil. Something is surely amiss if she has journeyed back to this land.Seek out Tarindrella in the Shadowthread cave to the north. It is dangerous, but we will be prepared with this antidote just in case.28726I'd hoped to never return to Teldrassil for such grim business. I'd hoped that its corruption had been wiped away completely.  Something foul lingers.These spiders suffer much more deeply from the corruption than the other nearby wildlife. They are becoming a danger to your people and a danger to the forest. We must thin their numbers, but more importantly, we need to find the source of the corruption that plagues them.I will come with you and aid you in this.28727If these spiders are born with corruption in their veins, then their broodmother must be at the root of this evil.Let us make our way to the far north end of the cave and seek out Githyiss the Vile. The answers we seek lie with her.28728I will pursue the trail of the Gnarlpine and track this corruption to its source. If you ever encounter Athridas Bearmantle in Dolanaar, he knows intimately of the problems that plague this forest, and he can direct you on how to help further.I'm sure we will meet again with time. Perhaps you can aid me in dealing with the source of this corruption once I locate it. For now, I will take you back to Dentaria so that you may finish your training. Thank you for all that you have done, .28729As part of a ritual to complete your training here in Shadowglen, you must learn about our recent history.There is a task you must perform. Go to the moonwell to our northeast and retrieve a phial of its water. While there, you will witness a glimpse of our magics and learn of our past.When you are done there, bring the water back to me, and I will direct you further.28730Tenaron Stormgrip oversees all that happens in this glade. He presides at the top of Aldrassil.If you look to your south, you will see the underside of the ramp that leads up to him. Ascend this ramp and complete your training.It was wonderful to have met you, . I swell with pride knowing that among young night elves, there are some so selfless and full of life as you are. You will do great things for our people. You will do great things for this world.Until we meet again.28731While there is more I could speak to you of the moonwells and of Teldrassil, I must send you along. Corithras Moonrage will be expecting you. I have poured the phial of water you brought to me into this vessel to bring to him.Seek out Corithras. You will find him at the moonwell in Dolanaar. Follow the road south from Aldrassil out of Shadowglen, and continue to follow the cobblestones as the road turns west.Mind you stay on the road though, . There are dangerous beasts in the forests of late.28732Raz and I were enlisted by the Guardians of Hyjal to investigate the re-emergence of Ragnaros into our world. Let me go ahead and confirm that he is back and he is angry! We also have evidence that these Twilight's Hammer cultists are moving elementals from here to Blackrock Caverns, over in the Eastern Kingdoms.Raz and I were about to head over there to investigate. We've got room for another in the mole machine if you're interested. Just meet us on the inside and we'll begin our journey.28733HELP! HELP! Crazed undead are attacking my farm!

I believe he had some troubles with the grell already.I expect he can offer you a well needed place to store more of your goods should you aid him.28735It was an ambush, ! As soon as we walked in a super-fat ogre named Rom'ogg Bonecrusher attacked us! Raz bravely defended me while I ran off to hide. I watched as they beat him unconscious and then dragged him to a place the fat one called the \"Chamber of Incineration.\" I think it's just down the hall across the bridge.I'm too scared to go any further. Take my all-purpose diving helm and search for Raz. I'll communicate with you through the helm.And if you find that ogre, kill him!28736The remnants of Schnottz's organization persist here on the Maker's Ascent, making the region deadly to any who draw near.There's plenty of ammunition, but without a good spotter, I'm just firing blind.Hop in and give me a hand here.

The energy is being siphoned from the creature into that lady! We need to stop this ritual!Kill Corla to get past this hall!28738Damn it! Raz won't stop! It's as if he were possessed with a burning vengeance for all things Twilight! It looks like if we're going to get past this room and catch up with Raz we'll need to take out the Twilight armorer, Karsh Steelbender. Kill him quick, .28740IT CAN'T BE! I... I was stuck inside one of those beasts for the better part of a month. Yes, literally stuck inside its stomach. If it weren't for my suit and the all-purpose helm I'd have died a fiery death! And look at that, it's had a litter of pups!Y... You gotta stop that thing, ! We can't let it or its pups make it out of here alive!28741GOOD GOLLY! Look at this place! A...

Let's take care of this monster and find Raz!28742Time for the big kill, pal! Shy-Rotam lurks in the north, the largest frostsaber of them all.You should feel honored. There's no fiercer game for a hunter to match their skills against... and if you saw the cash I'm being offered by gourmands that want a piece of this fellow, your eyes would pop out!Once you've got her, head on back to camp.

Screechers, the folk around here call 'em... they make a heck of a noise when you tussle with them!But he says they're the best owls he's ever tasted or sold, and I believe him.

They were the original paladins of the Light, and from their ranks came knights who would later join the Argent Dawn or the Scarlet Crusade. Though many have gone astray, they still possess valuable relics of the Silver Hand.Deep in Stratholme, under the watchful eye of Instructor Galford, volumes of the Annals of the Silver Hand survive. Any volumes you could recover would be a fitting addition to the rededicated Light's Hope Chapel.28756In life, my brothers and I fought against all the forces of the Scourge, but none were so reviled as the necromancers. It was not enough for them raise our dead comrades and send them against us; no, they created twisted golems of bone with scythes for hands.These aberrations slew many of my brothers, and yet we could not destroy them all. I ask you, , to carry on the task of the fallen.

Please, , if you have any sense of honor, you will go into Owl Wing Thicket and help me regain mine.28830My mysterious benefactors gave me more than one task. The second task took me farther south, to the Frostwhisper Gorge. I was surprised to learn that the gorge's bridge had been broken in two, preventing land travel from one side to the other.In addition, the juvenile Frostmaul tumblers were separated from their stronger adult parents. I thought that I could defeat them in battle.I was incorrect. I was forced to run away in shame.Teach these tumblers a lesson, . Fight them, and win.28831The Frostmaul giants wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for that damned Frostilicus. When the ground shook and the bridge broke, he and his fellow water elementals seeped out of the earth and took over the bottom of Frostwhisper Gorge, forcing the giants out.Damn you, Frostilicus!You would do me a great honor if you would send him back into the ground, .

An impostor by the name of Umbranse has taken advantage of us in our weakest hour, and now occupies the cave.Mazthoril is a place of extremely potent magic, and he does not know how to wield it. Even the wildlife suffers.The beasts nearby have been altered. Please, , I must ask you a favor. Gather their brains, so I can see if I can undo this Umbranse's wild magic.28838What a shame. Whatever Umbranse has done, he has prevented me from undoing his magic.He is wiser than I had anticipated.I do have a backup plan, however. I have seen owlbeasts enter and leave Mazthoril, even after Umbranse took control. Their ancient druidic magic must be capable of disabling Umbranse's. Luckily, I happen to be somewhat of an expert in their methods.Travel south, to Dun Mandarr. You will find a chest with a dreamcatcher in it.That will be your first step.28839The owlbeasts' sacred caves are located to the east. Within several of these caves, you should find totems. I want you to approach these totems and gather whatever essence you can from them. The dreamcatcher should absorb this essence for use within Mazthoril.28840I don't want our gambit to fail, . Such a failure would only draw attention to our efforts, giving Umbranse an opportunity to hone his defenses. No, we have to do this right the first time.The Frostwhisper Gorge, to the south, provides us access to powerful ice elementals. The water within these elementals' hulls should amplify the power of your dreamcatcher, ensuring our efforts.Obtain this water, . Then return to our small camp.28841Mazthoril's innate magic can wreak unimaginable havoc if mishandled. Umbranse's wanton casting within the cavern has opened up a number of tesseracts - in other words, portals - connecting to other worlds. If I am to return to Mazthoril, these tesseracts must be closed.The dreamcatcher will close the portals, buying you safe entrance into Umbranse's lair. First defeat whatever comes out of the tesseracts, then use the dreamcatcher to quickly close them, before anything else spills into this world.28842Umbranse lurks in the back of Mazthoril. His time has come.Unfortunately, I am unable to join you on this quest. While I'd love to get my hands on that snake, Mazthoril's magic would rip me apart in its current state. No, I need you to finish this for me.When the deed is done, use this charm. It will return you safely to the egress.28843Naz'jar!

It is as I suspected.Umbranse is at Mazthoril, the cavern that once belonged to the blue dragonflight, in the southwest. My mother, Haleh, will greet you there. She is stationed outside of the cave in a small camp with a few other survivors.Look for her campfire.28848I have heard tales of Umbranse, though I have not ever met him in person.

Hellscream will be accompanying the air fleet and specifically requested that you come along with us.No time to delay! Go to the Southern Rocketway Terminus here in Azshara, and check in with Friz Groundspin. I'll bring the zeppelin around to pick you up.28850I don't understand why the king wants to waste time saving his hide, but if you want to risk your life, then be my guest.Crowley and his men are holed up upstairs, probably plotting against the king as we speak!28852At last, reinforcements!

It says that members of the Horde should talk to Okrilla at Dreadmaul Hold.Hmph!

I knew that would get your attention.Word from the river dock here is that one of the miners in the Venture Company's Boulder Lode mine just northeast of here discovered an emerald the size of your fist.I know a few buyers who'd be interested in getting their hands on something like that, and I'd be willing to go half and half on its sale. You in?290162901729018290192902029021The Venture Company have a small research facility west of here, just past the Sludge Fen. I don't know very much about what they're doing, but did manage to discover that they're experimenting with something called a \"samophlange\".Now what the heck is a samophlange? Well, whatever it is, I want to examine it, so I need someone to go get it.I obtained a copy of their control system operating manual, you should be able to figure out how to disengage the samophlange from it.29022The three control valves are currently opened. The various readings on the control panel lead you to presume that they must be shut off before the apparatus can be shut off.29023With the apparatus deactivated, the control panel can be opened up and the samophlange removed from the console. With everything else in place, all that is left is to acquire the key to unlock the console.29024Pulling open the face of the control console reveals a dense jumble of wires, tubing and other strange mechanical objects--most of which seem to serve no practical purpose. Pushing them aside and digging deeper into the console, you find the samophlange. A tug removes it from its housing.29026I think I really put my foot into that one - it looks like I might have knocked one of the load-bearing fluxors into the spokes of the deregulator gear. We can fix this, easy. I know an expert on triple-expansion piston drives who would love to get her hands on a samophlange. Take the broken samophlange to Wenikee Boltbucket, just south of Mor'shan Rampart, she'll patch 'er right up.Hey, no need to walk - this gives me the perfect opportunity to test my personal people porter device!29027I want to fix this samophlange, but to do that I'm going to need some supplies. I ran out of seventeen-point-five gauge nugget slugs and I'm going to need a bunch of those for the work ahead.Unfortunately, the closest place to get them is the Burning Blade farm to the southwest. The place will be heavily guarded, so be careful, but the samophlange just might be worth the risk. Search the tool buckets, then return to me when you've gathered enough nugget slugs.29028The Shadow Council corrupts this once beautiful forest from their stronghold, Jaedenar, in the northwest.Now, one of our own is missing. We sent a lone scout by the name of Andalar Shadevale to Jaedenar, in hopes of thinning the enemy's ranks by stealth. We have not heard from him in days, and we fear the worst. There is a small chance he may still be alive. , please go at once and find him!29029Take this water to our scout in the field. He should be able to purify it for our attack on the Shadow Hold's defenses!29030The Midsummer Fire Festival is a time to honor the elements.  The element of fire stirs passion within us all.

Will you honor the flame with us, ?29032I can teach you to ride a Winterspring frostsaber, but it takes time and dedication. For this to work, both saber and rider must be highly trained and both must share a bond of deep trust.The cubs are only receptive to this training if they're introduced to their riders at a young age. Some of the cubs in the dens surrounding Frostsaber Rock are at the proper age to begin their training. If you help me gather the most promising of those cubs, I'll allow you to begin training with your own cub.2903329034I think this little fellow will be a good match for you.This cub is going to require a lot of attention to ensure that he grows up strong and healthy. You should check up on your cub at least once each day. Feeding and caring for your Winterspring cub is the best way to build a bond of trust with him.As your cub grows, he will shed his old whiskers and grow new ones appropriate to his size. Once your cub has shed twenty whiskers, bring him back to me along with some materials for your saddle.29035Your Winterspring cub looks at you and licks its lips. The little cat must be hungry and it's up to you to find a suitable meal for your charge.Rivern Frostwind mentioned keeping some shardtooth bear meat on hand for feeding his frostsaber cubs. Perhaps your cub would enjoy some fresh shardtooth meat of its own. Various kinds of shardtooth bears can be found all over Winterspring.29036The Midsummer Fire Festival is a time to honor the elements.  The element of fire stirs passion within us all.

As the cub's surrogate  you're responsible for providing meat until it can hunt on its own.But what if you let someone else do the hunting? The Winterfall furbolg of Winterspring usually have a lot of smoked meat on hand in both of their camps. Surely, they wouldn't miss a few pieces and your cub would get to try something new.29038Your Winterspring cub paws playfully at your hands. Without any playmates, the cub has few chances to practice its hunting skills.Perhaps you should take your cub hunting for the small arctic hares that burrow in the snow of northern Winterspring. Bring your cub close to the mounds of snow covering the hare burrows and wait for the cub's instincts to take over.29040The winterspring cub plays with a small tuft of fur from a large animal, batting the discarded hair about. While your cub looks like it's enjoying the new game, you wonder if it might get more enjoyment from a proper cat toy.With a little bit of leather from a yeti pelt and some feathers from crazed moonkin, you could make a respectable toy. You'll need a hide from the yeti in the Ice Thistle Hills southeast of Everlook and feathers from the moonkin at the Hidden Grove or Owl Wing Thicket.29054Greetings, !  I hope Hallow's End is treating you well.  Bah, enough of the small talk... Let's get down to business.  Undercity.  They have employed Hags and foul magic to launch petty attacks on our town.  Some may say, ignore the childish Horde.  I say, let's show them!Speak to my sister, Gertrude, and she will send you on your way to toss some stink bombs in Undercity.2906629067Potions, potions, potions.  Can I teach you about potions!You're going to have to bring me samples of your work, so I know you're ready.Remember , you can only learn ONE specialization, so if you complete your potion training, then elixir and transmutation specialization will no longer be available.290712907329074Merry met, !Hallow's End is a time for celebration and reflection, though many of us have forgotten why. Indeed some aspects of the festival, like the Wickerman, have been lost to time... until now, with the return of the Gilneans to the Alliance fold.Travel outside the gates of Stormwind and speak to Celestine of the Harvest.  She can tell you more about the Wickerman ceremony.29075Greetings, .  The Wickerman you see before you symbolizes self.  The flames that burn it are a cleansing fire.Tradition states that we take our burdens and give them to the fires.  We let go of our burdens as we approach the winter season and we gain clarity and peace.  Join us in our tradition, .Take a branch from the nearby bonfire and hurl it at the Wickerman.29078Another Alliance recruit, eh? I'm Marshal McBride, commander of this garrison. We don't see many of your kind here, , but we could sure use the help.You've arrived just in time. The Blackrock orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are doing the best that they can to push them back, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon.Head northwest into the forest and kill the attacking Blackrock worgs! Help my soldiers!29079The invading orcs aren't fools. They are sizing us up, making sure that when they attack it will be to their advantage.In the forest, to the northwest, are Blackrock spies. They peer at us through spyglasses, watching our every move - waiting. I want you take the fight to them!Kill the Blackrock spies! We must show them that we know they are watching us and that we are prepared!29080I have here an urgent message from Sergeant Willem. Turns out that the Blackrock orcs have hired goblin assassins. They ambushed our battalion behind the abbey. Willem has asked me to send him a hero. You have to go help them, !Find Sergeant Willem north of the abbey at the command tent. Go!29081Have you ever seen a goblin, ? They're wretched little green-skinned monsters that love only two things: gold and themselves.The Blackrock orcs have enlisted the aid of goblin assassins to kill our soldiers. If you look to the field in the north you can barely make out their silhouettes, sneaking about in the grass.I need you to head out there and kill every goblin that you see. They need to learn that nobody messes with the Alliance!29082Have you embraced the Holy Light yet, ? It is through the Holy Light that we are saved! It is through the Holy Light that I am able to heal these overly demanding soldiers! And it is through the Holy Light that you will be able to venture out into the field to the north and rescue our fallen brothers!Take this prayer book with you into the field and cast the Light's healing touch on the injured.29083Excellent work, ! The rear is now officially clear. We'll take care of the stragglers.

Working hard toward the Azerothian dream, ya know?Well soon as I set up shop, the Venture Co. next door decided they wanted me out. They've been harrassing me with threatening letters, using words like 'cease' and 'desist.' Worst of all, the schematics for my newest machine are missing, and I know those corporate pilferers stole them! Go to the Sludge Fen and knock out some of their employees. I know they're hiding my blueprints!29087Hey , do you see this footprint? We found them all over the camp last night! Nothing's missing, but all our belongings have been...examined. The muddy trails lead back toward the Sludge Fen.Someone's been sniffing around, and I don't like it one bit. Can you go west to the Sludge Fen and investigate? See if you can find any more tracks just like this one!29088Hey , we've got a real problem here. There's an overpopulation of hyenas just west of the Sludge Fen, and they're starting to become a menace.If I have to listen to them caterwauling one more night, I just might go crazy! Vernon over there says the hyenas might even have made off with one of his stabled pigs. We can't have that happening.Can you go thin out the hyena numbers? You'll find them parading in broad daylight to the west.29089Whatever is lurking around the Sludge Fen, it doesn't appear to be human. Judging from the remains around its tracks, it's also dangerous.You decide to follow the tracks down to the bottom of the lake and look for the creature's resting place.29090While we cast our eyes toward the cataclysm, who watches our backs? While our leaders take up arms against Deathwing, the Burning Blade plots our downfall.Even as we speak, they are gathering recruits and supplies at the farm to the southwest. I care not to meet death at the hands of the Burning Legion. It's time we take matters into our own hands., will you help me keep the vigil? Go and slaughter their ranks before it's too late.2909129092This information must be spread to the entirety of the Earthen Ring.

Hopefully it ain't too late.29103Because of the emissary's warning we were able to gather more adventurers to help defend.  But we thought we were going to be fighting trolls.Instead we found ourselves overwhelmed by serpents!They seem to have come from everywhere.  We are barely able to hold on, and I only suspect it's going to get worse.Help us and eliminate the serpents and perhaps your troll friend here can use some magic to cure the poisoned.29104Dere was somethin' not right about dem serpents, .  Dere was a trace of some bad mojo in da poison an' dat don't happen naturally.Da bonfire in da middle of da camp, we can use dat to perform a ritual.Whatever be makin' dese serpents attack, dey probably still watchin' over dem.Da only problem, , is dat I only be here in spirit form.

Den I'll handle da rest.29105Great, just what we need, the Gurubashi on the rampage using serpents to lead the charge.  Well at least we know that much.It's probably a safe bet that the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition have some insight into this.  If they don't they at least know how to fight the serpents.Head there and let them know what you saw here.  Let them know that the trolls are using serpents as their weapon.29106I heard that Magni Bronzebeard, who used to be the king of Ironforge, turned into a giant diamond! Is that true? How does someone just turn into a diamond? Maybe you have to be a king and that's why no one's done it before.Can we go see him? He should be in the part of Ironforge called Old Ironforge underneath the High Seat.29107I heard that Malfurion Stormrage came back from the Emerald Dream. I don't know where that is, but it sounds like it's really far away.Anyway, he's supposed to be at the top of the Temple of the Moon in Darnassus with the High Priestess. D'you think we could go meet him? He's got to be the most powerful druid in the history of Azeroth!29109The battle in Ashenvale rages on without relent. Our forces at the Mor'shan Ramparts are in desperate need of reinforcements and supplies.We have a major shipment of medicines and food headed north, and I need a capable  like you to guard it.Rocco Whipshank waits for you at the road north out of the Crossroads. Let him know you are ready to accompany the caravan.29110They took Balgor and the caravan supplies from our very doorstep!Those supplies are vital for our victory against the Alliance in Ashenvale, and Balgor...if anything happens to my dear little brother, I will rip every Burning Blade member to shreds myself., I need you to rescue Balgor and the captured caravan. Follow the path just north of us, up onto Dreadmist Peak. Do not let any of those Burning Blade dogs live.29111You've managed to stir the Burning Blade's nest. Our scouts report that they are gathering for an attack.You must complete the caravan's journey before they arrive. The supplies are packed, the kodos are rested, and I hope you don't mind but I made a few adjustments to your gun.If you meet up with any resistance, shoot first and ask questions later.Quickly! They come! Speak to me when you are ready to leave.29112Listen , we can't leave quite yet. I managed to overhear their plans while they were preparing for the ritual sacrifice.They're planning to use a powerful artifact called the Demon Seed to launch a full scale attack on the Horde. They're keeping it under close guard over in that cave.If you can get your hands on the Demon Seed, we should take it to my sister Nagala. She'll know what to do with it.29114We've been fending off serpents for days now, .  But the serpents are nothing compared to what else is out in that jungle.We hunters are being hunted.A large panther named Mauti has been dragging my men off into the bush.We sent Grent Direhammer, one of our best hunters, to track this beast down.Direhammer headed off to the east, perhaps you can find them there.29115The beast that's been hunting us... I've been hunting it.We call him Mauti.  He's a clever one.  But he made a grave mistake when he killed my brother.  Now that mistake is going to cost him.  Ol' Direhammer has got his scent.I've noticed him roaming just above Kurzen's Compound.  If we act fast, we can take him down.Are you ready, ?29117The other day, when some of us were out with the matron, I saw a gnome pushing a cart filled with toys. He had dolls, copper racers, leather balls, and some kites. I've always wanted to get a dragon kite and the matron said that if I saved all my money I could buy one, but that's going to be a long time.I think the gnome's name was Craggle Wobbletop or something like that. If we can find him, could we get some kites and fly them together? I saw him walking around the canals outside the Trade District.29118The real Mauti has run off with Grent Direhammer, but being the wise hunter that he is, he has fired flares off so you can track him.  Find Direhammer before it's too late!29119There's a brand new ice cream shop in Stormwind, and it's not just any old ice cream either. This ice cream is made by mages! You don't think I'm going to be hungry fifteen minutes after eating it, do you?I bet it tastes really good. Let's go try it!I heard some of the other kids talking about it, and they were saying the store is called The Cone of Cold and it's over near the Blue Recluse in the Mage Quarter.29120I got da feeling dat somethin' ain't right wit' dat panther, .  It ain't natural.  I gonna need to perform some rituals over da body.  Put Mauti down, an' den let's see what we can find out, .29121Ah... It's you, .  Mauti... He's dead?  Then my brother has been avenged.  I've only one request from ya... This scamp here, he's been pawing at me bare feet.  No dwarf should go to the earth with bare feet.Please, bury me with me boots.29122Remember that awful fire turtle, Nemesis, from the Firelands? He's dead now (yay!) but echoes of him keep trying to break through to Mount Hyjal.Go to the shores of the Ashen Lake and speak with my friend Tooga. Let him know you're ready to fight an echo of Nemesis, and the turtles will draw him into this world. Then you can hit him! Hard!Hide inside of Tooga's shell if he starts to erupt.29123Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders. The very nature of fire is that it is all-consuming. Lower your defense for just a moment and it will destroy everything in sight.Kill any of the fiery invaders you find.

Tings don't look good.We better check out da Rebel Camp to da north.  Maybe we find my contact dere.29125Spirit fragments of Malorne - seen to us mortals as ghostly white deer - still frolic through these forests. While Malorne is no longer with us, these pieces of his spirit may be of use to us.Travel east and walk among the trees. If you are able to get close enough to one of the spirit fragments, it will bestow its power to you.Oh, and take this staff. You may need it later.29126The portal that opened up to our east is guarded by a powerful flamewaker by the name of Galenges. We will need all of Malorne's help in defeating him.Do you remember the staff that I gave you? Place it in the pile of ash in front of the portal. Then pray that Malorne comes to your aid.29127Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders. The very nature of fire is that it is all-consuming.

I'm putting you in charge of a small squad to deal with them.I have selected an elite group of fighters to assist you. Travel to Sethria's Roost. Your compatriots have been instructed to meet you once you arrive. Then put an end to the elementals' assault.29129A pleasure, .It was kind of you to arrive so quickly.For reasons unknown to me, my master seeks audience with you.I would counsel you not to take this invitation lightly.

Its impact, however, has not.If action is not taken to change the course of this timeline's future, the outcome is clear.Brace yourself, mortal, and behold the future of Azeroth.29135I perceive the questions that burn within your mind and I must confess that I share in your uncertainty... a rare position for one such as I, and a most unsettling one.As I scour time to find traces of this obscured event, you must aid me in the creation of an Eye, both to test your worthiness, and to provide an essential tool in the unraveling of this mystery.Venture into the Plane of Fire, , and gather Eternal Embers. Bring them to me with Sands of Time and I will create the Eye.29137Lava worms are bursting through the ground behind our lines, breaking our formations and allowing elementals to slip through. You'll find them scattered throughout our entire front to the north, and upon the Ashen Fields further out.Stomp them back into their holes.29138We have warriors out in the field who are falling wounded, and many of our druids are too busy fighting to give them proper aid. I need you to go to the north, towards the Ashen Fields, and tend their wounds at least enough that they can make it back to safety.If you haven't any bandages or healing spells, I had Rayne put together this salve, which should prove sufficient to get them on their feet.29139Our warriors are doing everything they can to hold back the elementals, but their numbers are endless. We need to do something to slow down the assault.Find some suitable patches of dirt or ash out on the Ashen Fields to our north and plant these seeds. They will grow deadly vines that may slow down our enemies a bit. It's not much, but every bit helps.29141Molten Behemoths have joined the elementals upon the battlefield. They are crushing our front lines. I need you to halt their momentum.You'll find the beasts slow and clumsy. They can easily be outmaneuvered, but they will pack a devastating punch if they hit you. Be nimble, .29142The Druids of the Flame assault our front line, .These vile creatures have turned their backs on Elune's teachings and worship instead the Fire Lord, Ragnaros. Twisted by his insane power, they desire nothing more than to bury us in ash.We must counter their attack immediately!29143The fire elementals are pouring out of portals on the far side of the Ashen Fields. We need someone to close them. Cut off some of their reinforcements.Banishing these kinds of elemental magics is something our wisps are perfectly suited for. One will come with you. Lead it to a portal and keep it alive until it finishes.29144Greetings, !  Are you enjoying Hallow's End?  It seems that in response to our stink bombing the Undercity, the Horde has decided to stink bomb our city.  The stink bombs they drop are more potent than the ones used in the past.  The power of pine won't be enough.  We will need something with a little more power.  Use this Arcane Cleanser to remove the stink bombs from the city.29145You're a bit late. Hamuul, Malfurion, and some of our esteemed guests have already traveled to the invasion point, atop that cliff.Our gate to the Firelands is not yet completed, but it will be shortly. The sooner we can break through, the better.Go on! Hamuul will be expecting you.29146I heard that the newest members of the Horde, the goblins, built a crazy road in Azshara and it's just for rockets! Can you imagine? Ever since I heard about it, I've wanted to pay a visit. I asked Matron Battlewail about it and she said it's called the Rocketway!She even told me they're working on a prototype rocket with two seats. D'you wanna go there and see if we can try it out? I bet the experimental rocket is near the Secret Lab at the south end of the Rocketway...29147Today, we have an opportunity to make another assault against one of Ragnaros' greater minions: Millagazor. However, we first need to get some assistance.Use this artifact to invoke the power of Aviana. Once you have done so, travel northwest and gather some of her flock by calling out to them.Once you have done so, we may proceed against Millagazor.29148Millagazor is a creature of flame, but in many ways, he is not unlike the birds of this land. As such, Aviana's artifacts may still have the power to summon him.The fiery portal to the west is where you will find him. Use the quill near the portal's entrance, then prepare for a fierce battle.29149Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders.

They are the spawn of the vicious brood widow, Beth'tilac.Help us hold our line by clearing the area of Cinderweb Spinners or Cinderweb Creepers. It will drive her mad to see her children slain.29160We have a real problem on our hands. Not only are the nearby spiders vicious and predatory, their numbers appear to be endless.We need to stop the growth of their army. Cut their heads off in the egg, not on the battlefield.The Cinderweb Spinners' eggs are laid among the stone pillars to the north. Collect 20 eggs and bring them back to me.29161Oh, raspberries! Just when we had saved the last bear cub from the treetops, the fires returned and scared them again!I don't know if you know this, but baby bears are precious and soft.Go to the Whistling Grove, far to the northwest.

Save them, !29162I love all creatures of the forest, even spiders, despite the fact that they are icky. But the spiders from the Firelands are worse than icky. They're burny, and don't belong here.Find the fire portal in the western Regrowth, and use the gem I gave you earlier to force it open. When a fire spider emerges, step on it! Unless it's big. Then, do something y to it.Oh, and use the gem if spider venom makes you woozy!29163Of all of our tasks here in Hyjal, the most pressing is simple: destroy these invaders.

Every enemy defeated purchases more time for Hyjal.29164The wolf ancient, Lo'gosh - or, if you prefer, Goldrinn - has many weapons available to him, but always the most underestimated is his howl. Today, we will use this weapon to summon and defeat Lylagar, one of the lieutenants of flame that lurk within the Firelands.Defeat any of the creatures of flame within the Regrowth, and then use the Fang of the Wolf while standing atop their corpse. Soon, your howl will echo across all of Kalimdor.29165The easternmost portal of flame is the domain of Lylagar. Stand before the portal, deliver a challenging howl, and then force the fiery beast to submit.29166One of the biggest dangers that our druids face when fighting within the Firelands is simple dehydration. Our proveditors spend a significant amount of time preparing canteens for the troops on the other side. We do have other methods, however.In the greener thickets to the east, you should still find some blueroot vines which have not yet burned. These plants hold a tremendous amount of water in their roots - and also provide some energy for the weary soldier.29167Lady Sylvanas, leader of the Forsaken, is s'posed to be one of the best warriors in the Horde, maybe even as good as the warchief himself!I've always wanted to meet her, .

Several powerful beasts now reside in the cracks and hollows of the ancient city.We have seen the powers that the Gurubashi priests wield - they turn the very plantlife against us with their venomous concoctions.

I don't know what that means, but I always wanted to meet him. Some of the other orphans even have his hoofprint.Would you take me with you to Mulgore? Our tutor says tauren bring their dead to a place called Red Rocks to honor them. We should go there and see if we can find Cairne.29177The agents of Twilight continue their assault within this pocket of the Firelands. We must not let our offensive fall! Take wing, and destroy as many of those lancers as you can!Do not forget to pick up and equip your lance first.29179The elementals continue to press on us, and I do not expect them to subside any time soon.You'll find them pouring across the Ashen Fields to the north. Thin their ranks.29180My inscrutable theories confirm rumors of vast treasure in Zul'Aman. There'll be mounts and mansions for everyone! First things first, though. You must earn your share, after all....Our initial efforts here haven't gone as well as I hoped. In fact, my map, and the recruits I lent it to, have gone missing. They were after a troll-beast named Nalorakk.Forget the crew, I need that map! Succeed, and you'll go down in history as the one who helped Budd Nedreck unlock the secrets of Zul'Aman!29181Skylord Omnuron and his Druids of the Talon have been a fearsome force for us back in Hyjal. I know that they prefer the familiar skies of that battlefield, but the time may come when we need them here nonetheless.If you get your hands on enough marks, you should appeal to Omnuron that his druids should be on the main front. Omnuron watches out for his own, but he also understands the importance of this effort.29182Many of the Druids of the Talon have made their way to the Molten Front, at your beckoning. You should go to Skylord Omnuron at Malfurion's Breach and see how their wings are faring in those burning skies.2918329184How did those fools fail? I told them to be careful - even gave them disguises to help them blend in. Ahh, well. The bright side of their failure is that this opportunity falls to you.Succeed, and you'll be well on your way to joining my crew and sharing in the immeasurable fame that will soon be mine. Not that I need any more, mind you.There are yet a few portions of my map that require further exploration before our excavation can be initiated....2918529186Dis new warlord of da Amani, he be nothin' but an overgrown brute without da protection of a strong witch doctor and he has just dat.Da new warlord's ally be Hex Lord Malacrass, da most feared witch doctor to walk among da Amani in decades.

We fear they have succumbed to the deadly spiders in the vicinity.Hope may not be lost, however. The spiders often wrap up their live prey in cocoons for later consumption.Go search the pillars to the north for cocooned victims. You may yet be able to save some of our brethren.29190The other day, when some of us were out with the matron, I saw a goblin pushing a cart filled with toys. He had dolls, copper racers, leather balls, and some kites. I've always wanted to get a dragon kite and the matron said that if I saved all my money I could buy one, but that's going to be a long time.I think the goblin's name was Blax Bottlerocket or something. If we can find him, could we get some kites and fly them together? I saw him pushing his cart around the Drag.29191There's a brand new ice cream shop in Orgrimmar, and it's not just any old ice cream either. This ice cream is made by a crazy goblin mage! You don't think it's going to disappear if I don't finish it in fifteen minutes, do you?I bet it tastes really good. Let's go try it!I heard some of the other kids talking about it, and they were saying the store is called the Cone of Cold and it's in the southern part of the Goblin Slums.29192We must tread carefully, . Fandral's Druids of the Flame practice their fiery magic beyond the pillars to the north.I need you to capture one of those druids alive for questioning. We must seize every opportunity to learn of their plans.One of my wardens will accompany you. Follow her instructions if you wish to survive.29193Time well spent, mortal.While you struggled in the Plane of Fire, my watchers and I were able to determine when and, most importantly, where our vision was obscured.We discovered that the shroud was placed over the Nexus, far to the north in the realm of the blue dragonflight.I have attuned the Timeless Eye to show you the occurrences that remain hidden to us here.Bring it to Coldarra at once and seek out a place suitable for its activation.Go, child. Time is of the essence...29194Your tale rings true, . Much has changed since the death of Malygos - little of it for the better.I know of the device you carry, and I recognize Anachronos' magic in its creation. There is but one place in all of Coldarra that would allow this Timeless Eye to be used discreetly.You will require my assistance if you hope to succeed. Speak with me again inside the Nexus and you shall have it.29195We appear to have everything under control. Our invasion portal to the Firelands will be opened momentarily, and the elementals have not put up much fight.Assist our druids by dispatching the last few of these elementals. Then, once the gate has been opened, we can make our move.29196We should not worry about this \"Druid of the Flame\" for the time being. We must be concerned with the continuance of our operation.Return to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If Ragnaros was prepared for our arrival, then I anticipate that his forces will launch a counterattack soon.29197Our invasion plan looks to have backfired. Several of our birds have already reported in, speaking of fires breaking out across the vales of central Hyjal.Now, many of our druids are stranded out in the field, unprepared for such a large-scale attack. Thisalee was near Ashen Lake, and several others were out in the Regrowth, to the northeast.Go, ! Find them, and make sure that they do not succumb to this backdraft!29198Malfurion is working on a miracle for us. He believes that, in this time of peril, he can resurrect Malorne to protect the Sanctuary. I have faith in him.In the meantime, we need to hold this perimeter. Stand by, and make sure no harm befalls my fellow arch druid.29199We suffered heavy losses during the backdraft after our invasion attempt. Our second attempt cannot fail.We need reinforcements before we attempt another invasion. Please, , work with Matoclaw to obtain enough resources to afford reinforcements. Then, we take our second and final stab at the Firelands.29200Before we depart, , I have another matter to which you should attend.A Druid of the Flame has been spotted in the ruins to the northwest. I suspect it is the same one that attacked us at the portal several days ago. Now would be an ideal time to see what it is that she truly wants... and if necessary, dispose of her.See to this flame druid, then we can continue on our planned course.29201There will be time to mourn for Hamuul later. His is the first of many inevitable casualties in this war.... but our attack cannot wait, nor should the momentum we have gained over the last several days be wasted.The portal atop Nordune Ridge is now open. Our reinforcements are prepared, and they await only my order to pass through the portal.We will meet again on the other side of the portal. Once there, we shall ensure that our foothold is secure.29202I apologize for speaking curtly with you earlier. The loss of Hamuul was shocking to me, and difficult to cope with.They brought in his body while you were away. He is alive, but - as you might imagine - he is very, very badly burned.The scars are deep. He may not live.I have arranged for some of our finest healers to attend to him. If it is not too much to ask, would you speak with Dorda'en Nightweaver? He and his fellow attendants may need your help.29203Leyara has been spotted in the Igneous Depths.

It's your decision, .29205Captain Saynna Stormrunner is launching an attack against the Forlorn Spire. If you head to the northeast, you'll find her at the bottom of the ramp leading up towards that rise.Go there and escort one of her druids to the tower with any forces that she can spare. You'll have quite a fight ahead of you - make sure the druid lives to see the end of it or they'll not be able to seize the tower.29206Skylord Omnuron and his druids are seeking to push through the Furnace to our northwest. They've been able to fly over the dangers, but they really need someone on the ground to help them secure the territory past the fire... someone like you.If you want to aid the Druids of the Talon, wait for one of Omnuron's Windcallers to start pushing through the fire, stay close to him, and keep him safe from any attackers within the flames.2920829209One of our druids moved ahead into the Igneous Depths in pursuit of a Druid of the Flame.Go to her. Help her.29210Shalis has gone with one of our druids to stop a Druid of the Flame that is performing a summoning ritual in the Igneous Depths, below us. They have been tasked with killing the druid, but I need you to stop the ritual.You'll find the entrance to the cavern east of the Magma Springs. Once inside, you'll see 8 blue runes spread throughout the cavern. You can use these runes to protect you from the fiery creatures, but you need to stamp all of them out to end the ritual. You will need to be swift.29211The fight has taken us to Fandral's doorstep. His druids are channeling energies of the Firelands into a vessel called the Solar Core.Should this vessel detonate on Azeroth, none of us will have a home to return to.We need to strike at the Solar Core now, while it is still vulnerable. You can find the infernal device to the northeast.29213Tings ain't looking good.  Dat panther was under some powerful magic.  We better check on dat hunter an' see how he be doin'.29214The Shadow Wardens are back in the Regrowth. I know that they take the loss of Fandral from their custody very seriously, so it wouldn't take much prodding to bring them to the Firelands to hunt the Druids of the Flame, and perhaps aid us otherwise in the process.Should you come upon enough marks, you should seek out Captain Saynna Stormrunner at the Sanctuary of Malorne and secure her aid.29215The Shadow Wardens have joined the fight at the Molten Front, on your request. You should find Captain Saynna Stormrunner and see to it that they've found a way to best apply their skills.29217After we arrived, I dispatched my scouts to learn more about da Zandalari presence here in Zul'Aman. Many returned with useful information, but four still be missin'.

You must travel to Nordrassil at once to seek him out.I shall remain here to conceal the evidence of our activities. Speak of this to no one else!29226We've been fending off serpents for days now, .  But the serpents are nothing compared to what else is out in that jungle.We hunters are being hunted.A large panther named Mauti has been dragging my men off into the bush.We sent Grent Direhammer, one of our best hunters, to track this beast down.Direhammer headed off to the east, perhaps you can find them there.29227The beast that's been hunting us... I've been hunting it.We call him Mauti.  He's a clever one.  But he made a grave mistake when he killed my brother.  Now that mistake is going to cost him.  Ol' Direhammer has got his scent.I've noticed him roaming just above Kurzen's Compound.  If we act fast, we can take him down.Are you ready, ?29229Well, that explains why Mauti seemed smaller...  The real Mauti has run off with Grent Direhammer, but being the wise hunter that he is, he has fired flares off so you can track him.  Find Direhammer before it's too late!29230I got da feeling dat somethin' ain't right wit' dat panther, .  It ain't natural.  I gonna need to perform some rituals over da body.

Maybe we find my contact dere.29234I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, , which means my mission here now must fall to you.A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the World Tree's branch.29235I hope you like to fight, .  Your troll friend has been through here and warned us that the Gurubashi were on the rampage.  I never thought the battle would be this glorious though.Come, join in our fight and let's show these Gurubashi trolls the might of the Horde!29236Bwemba...  Is that you?Your contact was here.  He was eager to get to the next location and warn them.  And really, who could blame him?  I gave him use of a wyvern to reach the goblins of Hardwrench Hideaway, in the Cape of Stranglethorn.I will give you use of one of my wyverns to reach Hardwrench.Talk to me when you are ready to go, .29237Da people...

Change dem back into da person dey were before.We gotta act fast.  Da zombies don' rest.29238Some of da survivors mentioned food, .  We better check da food supplies.  I gotta a bad feelin' about dis.29239Much has transpired since last we spoke.I have taken it upon myself to visit the Nexus and recover Anachronos's artifact, but not before using it for myself. Now I too have witnessed that which you have seen.Before discussing the matter further, allow me to express my gratitude to you for your assistance, both here and in the Plane of Fire.29240Now, back to the matter at hand...I am convinced that the vision in the Nexus is one of Deathwing's illusions designed to bring conflict into our flight at a very fragile time.The Worldbreaker would only be strengthened were we to fall to infighting.Still, a gnawing sense of unease tempts me to take a path of caution.It would be wise for me to take Tarecgosa and withdraw until the time of choosing.29241When Jin'do was last ripped from dis world, he survived as a shade, weak and broken, in da spirit world.But Jin'do always had power over da spirits.  One by one, he broke dem to his will, and wit' each soul devoured, Jin'do got closer ta' rippin' a hole through to dis world.Ta be here now...Da spirits be wit' us, we must end Jin'do.29242Listen, friend.  I don't know you, and you don't know me.  But as long as we're both here, there's something Revilgaz wanted me to mention.Maybe you're taking a stroll through this troll-infested jungle-ocalypse.  Maybe you happen to find a priceless troll artifact or two.  Maybe you bring it back to me and I accidentally leave behind a little present for ya'.If you must know, it's for a project.  And no, you can't ask what the project is.29243One of Ragnaros' Lieutenants has shown itself at Ragnaros' Reach.  It is time to strike. Captain Saynna has requested that you be there to help see the fight through.Witherbranch and some others will have joined the battle by the time you arrive.  You should make haste to the northwest and find them.29244Captain Saynna has requested your presence at Ragnaros' Reach. A Lieutenant of Flame has shown himself and she thinks you are our greatest chance at striking against him.Make your way there as soon as you're able.29245A small, dried acorn has fallen out of the Flame Druid's robe.Why would a Druid of the Flame be carrying it around?Perhaps someone at Malfurion's Breach would like to see it.29246The Arch Druid has an immense tolerance for pain. I've treated burn victims that spend twenty-two hours a day screaming in pain, and their burns weren't even half as bad as what Hamuul has suffered.Nevertheless, I can sense that he is in greater discomfort than normal today. Bring me the hearts of the large fire elementals to the southeast. I can use them to prepare a soothing salve for our patient.29247We have an ample supply of medical supplies here at the Sanctuary, but we mustn't lose sight of the fact that we are at war. Hamuul isn't the only person who has need of bandages.The fiery behemoths that roam Sethria's Roost wear flame-resistant wrappings that will serve Hamuul as ably as any bandage. Bring me those wrappings, and I will prepare them for use on the Arch Druid.29248Having been burned so badly, Arch Druid Hamuul is suffering from edema - swelling of the body's tissues. It takes a great deal of his attendants' effort to keep his swelling down enough for him to breathe.Normally, to reduce this swelling, we make cuts in his flesh, but he is weak, . I cannot cut him today. I need your help.Flamewaker scales will aid with the swelling, but you need a lot of them.29249The acorn seems to be unharmed.No point in beating around the bush. Let's plant it and see what comes out.Luckily for you, we brought some leftover soil with us to help establish our base.You'll find the soil at the graveyard directly east.29250You aren't one of the zombies...A troll?  I did see one, just before the outbreak...  He warned us, told us to be on our guard... But it was too late.Your troll friend headed to Booty Bay to warn them...29251Look, .  You've helped out plenty so far, but that's not going to be enough.  I need these crazy trolls stopped, or at least stopped from getting into Booty Bay.I'm going to send a man in to oversee the action, but I want you to go into Zul'Gurub and make something happen.At the very least, I want you to find me something that will help keep these trolls out of Booty Bay.You do that and we'll treat you right.29252I've been sent here by Baron Revilgaz of Booty Bay to make sure this troll menace is halted.  Or that it is at least halted at the gates of Booty Bay.I want action and I want results.I want you to get in there and kill.I want you to get in there and find me something that will help keep these trolls out of Booty Bay.You do that and we'll make sure you get paid.29253There is a stash of loot located in the statue on Janeiro's Point just northwest of Booty Bay in Stranglethorn Vale.Head to the statue and claim your prize, .29254The little red flower wiggles its tendrils happily. It seems to like you!Perhaps Avrilla would like to see what grew out of the acorn.29255The Crimson Lasher has developed some cracking blisters on its vines. Without treatment, this condition could be life threatening.Luckily, the Charred Soldiers and Charred Vanquishers in the area produce a waxy substance known as Embergris, which should soothe the Lasher's pain.Bring me some of this substance, and kill those nasty fire elementals while you're at it.29257We've discovered a new species of flower growing in the Magma Springs to the north. Amazingly, they sustain themselves in pure molten lava!Please go and retrieve some specimens for me. I'm sure that further study of these plants will shed some light on your little friend here.Speaking of which, he seems quite eager to go with you. Let's hope he behaves himself.292612926229263As far as I'm concerned, there's no problem that can't be solved with bombs. And if a bomb doesn't solve your problem on the first try... use a bigger bomb.So there's this big worm that's been eating people near the lava pools up north. Search for breath bubbles to find it. Attack it until it prepares to bite, then place this bomb down in front of it. Then sit back and watch the fireworks.Hmm... there was one other thing I wanted to say... oh yeah! Don't get eaten.29264Of all Ragnaros' minions, the flamewakers appear to be the most devoted. Most of them dwell within this cave, preparing for another attack. Our foothold may be strong, but we will not tolerate any surprise attacks from these worms.No, we will strike first.Tear them apart, .29265My fellow druid, Choluna, has asked us to collect any specimens of plant life that we might find here in the Firelands......I don't know whose idea it was to bring scholars to a warfront.Nevertheless, you will already be in the cave - killing things - so be on the lookout for anything growing out of the ground.29267So much violence, so much death.  Brothers have died, a mother has died, and now a panther cub will die if there is no one to take care of it.Will you take a pause from the violence to help care for a panther cub?29268So much violence, so much death.  Brothers have died, a mother has died, and now a panther cub will die if there is no one to take care of it.Will you take a break from the violence and help care for a panther cub?29269I was charged with her protection, yet it was she who sacrificed herself for my sake.I cannot bear to lose her, . I must make a solemn request of you.Never has a mortal borne the essence of a true dragon, but with your permission I would make an exception.Please, while there is life in her, will you allow me to bind Tarecgosa to you?29270Tarecgosa is bound to you, , but only temporarily. An aspect's power is required to permanently seal her essence.Malygos's successor will not be chosen until Azeroth's moons next eclipse, and the bond you share will not last until then.Fortunately, there is a way to buy us the time we need. Powerful elements exist that can extend the ritual's effects. Some of these can be found in the Plane of Fire, with which you've become familiar.Obtain them, , and sustain Tarecgosa until the eclipse.29272Need... water... badly...29273The fire hawks of Fireplume Peak can withstand incredible temperatures. While you'll often find them circling the skies above, they're also known to swim in molten lava.Isn't that right, Anren?We'd like to know just how hot that lava can get. Fireplume Peak has three large lava pools. Use this to measure the temperature of each.29274On the Firelands' largest island, our troops have been having trouble against Shannox, the flamewaker hunter. Not only does he have impeccable aim, but he keeps trained hounds that give our troops no end of trouble.Tholo, in all his wisdom, thinks it would be a good idea to study the biology of these hounds. I, of course, agree with Tholo.You will find several hounds in the Molten Flow, beneath the Furnace. We will need their ashes to study.29275The Druids of the Flame... an order of druids that, up until a few weeks ago, Tholo and I had never even heard of. Now, under the leadership of Fandral Staghelm, they threaten our mission's success with their mastery of fire.It would appear that they store some supplies in the Igneous Depths, to the northeast. Perhaps, if we can get some of those supplies, we will have more luck when we take the fight to Fandral.29276The Widow's Clutch, to the northeast, is named after Beth'tilac, the enormous queen of the flame spiders. Her webs and her poison are a nagging threat to our main offensive force.We believe that if we study the flame spiders here on the Molten Front, we can use that information to find success against Beth'tilac. Use whatever methods you can to gather their venom and their web fluid, then return to my trusted friend Anren.29278Have you seen those fireballs falling out of the sky? I saw one crash in the fields to the north, and the rock that landed was made of pure Living Obsidium!I can use the material to craft ultra-sturdy heat proof armor and weapons for our troops. Can you bring me a lode?Go to the Magma Springs and touch one of the magnetic stones. Just watch where you're standing when the rain of fire hits, and gather up the rocks before they crumble from the impact.29279We've constructed this moonwell, but it serves little purpose until it is filled with the sacred waters of the Well of Eternity.With an active moonwell, we would be able to bless our food stores, and we may also be able to use the blessing to offer you some protection from fire as well.When you've obtained enough marks, speak to Matoclaw at the Sanctuary of Malorne. She'll be able to secure transport of the sacred waters.29280I have dispatched the sacred moonwell waters to Malfurion's Breach, as you requested. Ayla is well trained in tending to them. You should return to her and see the boons she weaves for you there.29281These druids be lackin' the tools ta properly handle the job out 'ere. I got meself a buddy back at day ol' stag shrine through the portal though. If we were ta be gettin' reunited, we'd sure have some real toys ta use against ol' Ragboy and 'is cronies.Take some of dem mark things an' go find Matoclaw. Ask her fer Ricket. We need'r here so we can be causin' some real trouble.29282Ricket should be at Malfurion's Breach with Damek, as you requested. I'm not sure you fully know what you're getting into with those two though.Speaking of which, you should probably go check on them... make sure they haven't managed to blow up the Sentinel Tree itself. As long as you keep them busy with the elementals, the chances of \"accidents\" at the breach should lessen dramatically.29283The ancients await in Hyjal. The Firelands will prove a dangerous place for them considering their... composition, but their strength will be of great use to us if we are to face any of Ragnaros' lieutenants.Gather your marks, and seek out Elderlimb at the Sanctuary of Malorne. If they are to march with us, he would be the one leading them through the portal.29284The ancients have seen the value of your wisdom, and have set root at Malfurion's Breach. You should seek out Elderlimb. I am certain he would like to hear from you.29285The time of choosing has arrived, .While only members of the blue dragonflight may attend, Tarecgosa's binding makes your presence requisite.I must ask that you take on her form and vote on her behalf.Do not tarry. The moment of the eclipse draws near....29287These fire hawks are beings of fire, but they exhibit much of the same behavior that we've seen in birds back home. It makes me wonder from where they originate.Back to the point - I think we might be able to train them. Domesticate them if you will. Use them against our enemies.I'd like you to retrieve one of their eggs from the top of Fireplume Peak. If you can bring it back to me safely, I will see to the rest.29288Our scouts are bringing back reports of fire hawk hatchlings all over the peak... their eggs must have hatched very recently. Better yet, it seems that they're extremely docile.I know it may sound a strange and perhaps unsavory request, but if you were able to bring some of those hatchlings back to me, I might be able to train them to aid us in our war efforts.Are you willing?29289Unsurprisingly, their matriarch has taken offense to us taking her young to train for our own uses. It's understandable... and a bit tragic actually. We are very much the villains in this exchange.Now is not the time for such thoughts. These creatures are beings of fire, and on more than one occasion, they've claimed the lives of our kin. With their matriarch angered, the danger has grown immensely.I need someone to quiet her rage, and I fear you may be the most capable.29290Look at that! It's incredible! Born less than two days ago and already full grown. Sadly, I suspect their life cycle is similarly short, so we'll have to take advantage of any time we have.His training went remarkably well. I want you to be the one to take him out and unleash him on the bulk of the enemy forces gathered near Ragnaros' keep.Show no mercy, .29293Many of our Storm Crows have gone ahead to scout the peak and attempt to retrieve some of the fire hawk eggs, but to very little success I'm afraid. The thermals make it nearly impossible to fly safely, and the fire hawks aren't exactly friendly either.I need you to head over there and rescue any druids that you can. I've got splints, bandages, burn salves, smelling salts... anything you'll need to get them back on their feet, assuming they're still alive. Please hurry and help anyone you can find.29295You're not going to take on fiery behemoths wearing THAT, are you? If you aren't wearing my obsidium crafted goods, you're going to burn right up! And even if you are, you can never have enough of the good stuff.Look , I can craft you the best armor that gold can buy, but I need pure, unsmelted Living Obsidium first.The Obsidium Punishers on Fireplume Peak are literally made of the stuff. Go kill them and gather their pieces.29296The fire hawks are upset by our continued presence. They're getting extremely hostile, and not just in the usual territorial ways. I worry that if we leave them unchecked, they will soon be joining the assault on our tree, and I'm not sure we're capable of handling that.Go across the way to Fireplume Peak and do what you have to to keep them in check. I'm far more concerned with our safety right now than theirs, so be decisive about it.29297Staghelm's druids are putting up a fierce fight at Wildflame Point to the northeast.The druids fly above us in fire crow form, then strike when we least expect it. Worst part is, they know exactly how to stay out of our reach!We would be totally helpless, except Damek lent me his trusty harpoon. He says these weapons will fly straight and true even in this super dense air.Take the dwarf's weapon and shoot some birds out of the sky!29298This locket has a few small leaf-shaped carvings etched into its face, but any other details have been rubbed away with time, or burned away with fire. It appears to be druidic in nature.Most druids pass through Moonglade during their training. If anybody can help you decipher where this locket came from, it would be Rabine Saturna of Nighthaven.29299I've been making progress in my research, . Based on what we've witnessed in the local flora, it's quite possible that your Lasher also accepts superheated liquids as a principal source of nutrition.I'd like you to help me with a little experiment. The Emberspit Scorpions that inhabit the Magma Springs to the north spew out burning pools of fire during combat.Take the Lasher and observe his reaction to the scorpions' Ember Pools.29302The initials seem to have worn off of this locket, but I can sense a power within it that suggests only one possible owner:Leyara, the Druid of the Flame.Stand back, and we shall see what surprises this locket contains.29303You were insightful to bring this locket to me, . I am among the few who know where Valstann's body lays.You can find his resting site in a small graveyard, southeast of Astranaar, in Ashenvale. Bring this locket to the site, and it may unlock more memories.Farewell, , and good luck on your journey.29304Our forces are falling beneath an unleashed monstrosity - Charhounds from the molten depths.These dogs fear nothing and will not stop until their lust for blood is satisfied. Our forces are barely holding them back.Go join the defenders in the Ashen Fields or in the Molten Flow. Perhaps you can make a dent in their numbers.29305One of Ragnaros' Lieutenants has shown himself at Ragnaros' Reach, the walled area to our northeast.I hoped to send you as soon as you returned, but I suspect Witherbranch and some of our forces have already joined the fight by now. You should hurry.You should be able to drop down the cliff wall right here and reach them quickly.29307You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, , and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect.My ascension has endowed me with incredible power. I have taken the liberty to strengthen Tarecgosa's bond with you, though she will require a more... permanent home.I would have you venture one last time into the Plane of Fire and bring me the heart of Ragnaros.When next we meet, I will be able to suitably thank you for all that you have done.29308You are the first mortal to witness a dragon council, , and among the only beings in Azeroth to take part in the choosing of an Aspect.My ascension has endowed me with incredible power.

Its power is to be harnessed to further endow your weapon.The ceremony is to begin shortly. I have been appointed to escort you there when you are ready.29310On the day when Leyara attacked Hamuul, she was waiting near some ruins in Hyjal, northwest of the Regrowth. She acted strangely at the time: calm, silent, and staring off into the distance. Perhaps that location is of some importance to her.The locket might react if brought to that location.29311In her memories, Leyara spoke of Malfurion. The tragedies of her past - at least, in her opinion - are largely due to his actions.Malfurion must remember Leyara from before she became a Druid of the Flame. You resolve to bring the locket to him in the Firelands. Hopefully he can answer any remaining questions.29312It is an honor to make your acquaintance, .Your deeds echo in the ears of Azeroth's creatures, mortal and immortal alike.I shall present the heart of Ragnaros to Kalecgos when he arrives.

The secret is something simple, but it makes all the difference.We bury the jars in the ground until it's ready to serve and my latest batch has just reached that point. You can find the jars buried in earthen mounds all over the city. Would you help me gather them while the contents are just right?29314The living are not the only ones who require sustenance. One of my duties is to prepare the rice cakes that are left for the ancestors. Normally, my senior apprentice has the honor of taking the cakes to the Temple of the Moon for blessing and then presenting them to the ancestors. Since she is out of the city today, would you mind performing the duty in her place?29315Some chefs complain that our beloved Undercity doesn't boast the ingredients to create truly fine fare.Such mewling little cretins. Delicious delights abound!Gather some of the rank, slimy Sewer Caps growing in Undercity's northwest sewer line and return them to me.29316There are certain things that everyone needs, from the basic household cook to the master chef. One of the city's most important staples is rice flour. Most families keep at least one basket of rice in their houses and the residents of the Craftsmen's Terrace and Tradesmen's Terrace are no different.I often ask my students to help with the task of pounding rice into flour since it's good practice and an endless task. Why don't you give it a try?29317There was an... incident... with an orc guard and one of Master Apothecary Faranell's abominations.Apparently, the Kor'kron Overseer chopped its head clean off and kicked it into the slime.Faranell's apprentices searched for hours but they can't find the thing. Care to try fishing it up? I'm sure the old fellow'd be grateful.29318One of my responsibilities is to feed the sentinels of Darnassus while they're on duty. It's a time-consuming task, but one I'm happy to undertake. It's also a great way to practice your skills. Would you mind helping me with today's meal? Simply take these ribs, cook them near a stove or fire, and distribute them to sentinels throughout the city.29319Some of our apothecaries took to dumping their more volatile waste chemicals into Stillwater Pond and... well, let's just say that no one wants to know how big mutant flesh-eating toads can grow.Would you consider fishing up some giant flesh-eating tadpoles before it gets to that? Just don't try to handle them with your bare hands.29320You've fished in Brightwater Lake, yes?The prize catch there is one of the lake's massive corpse-fed pikes. However, they only bite on a very specific type of bait... corpse worms.Search the graves in the courtyard up top and you should find some.29321It seems like everyone I know loves clams, but I can't stand them! They're smelly and slimy, and harvesting them means digging through mud. Give me a fishing pole and some bait any day.Still, I want to surprise my brother with a bucket of fresh clams. I'd reward you if you were willing to gather those clams for me.Just go through the portal to Rut'theran Village and look for the clams in the shallows near the shore.29322It takes a special sort of fisherman to reap the bounty of Undercity's burbling slime troughs. Think you can handle gathering some of the squirming, sentient slime mold slithering about down there?You can try to fish them up, but they're wily; you might be better off just diving into the ooze and grabbing them.Remember, they're only useful alive and intact... who'd want to eat a dead slime mold?! Disgusting.29323We've used up most of our food stores in taking care of refugees and feeding those whose homes and livelihoods were destroyed. If we don't replenish our stores, we'll all be in danger next time there's a bad storm or a Horde invasion.Perhaps you'd be willing to help me build up our stock of lake whitefish. You can catch it anywhere in Darnassus, and once it's dried, it'll keep until it's needed.29324Have you met Sister Aquinne? She and I grew up together in Dolanaar, and she recently came to the city to study at the Temple of the Moon. We decided to go for a boat ride, but the clumsy oarsman managed to capsize the craft!When we got back to the shore, Aquinne's moon pendant was missing. The lakes in Darnassus are full of giant catfish who will gobble up anything shiny!I've been catching them nonstop, hoping to find the one with her pendant. I don't suppose you want to help?29325Have you ever eaten octopus meat? It takes some getting used to, but it's my favorite! I even know some people who like to eat the whole thing while it's alive!I don't plan on trying that anytime soon, but I am out of fresh octopi at the moment. Will you help me gather some more? They live in the shallow water off the shore near Rut'theran Village.29326Hello, ! My brothers and sisters of the Earthen Ring have spoken well of your deeds in the wake of the Cataclysm. But much remains to be done if we are to heal this broken world.Walk with me, friend. Preparations for a ceremony are underway, a ritual that I hope will be a turning point in our battle against the Twilight's Hammer.When all is done, you will be able to spread the word about our triumph here.29327I do know the one you seek... but I do not know if it is wise for you to follow him. He has cast himself into the cyclone. The winds now tear at his body and mind, leaving nothing but shreds of flesh and doubt.Chasing after him would only expose you to the same fate. The wind's edge leaves nothing uncut.You have been warned. Now what will you do?29328Once again, , I cannot do this without your help. I will try to quiet this tempest, but you will need to fight back the unstable elementals that whirl around it. Only then can we free Go'el!29329With the Stonemother's blessing, I can take us to where Go'el is being held.We must be careful. The Twilight's Hammer has agents all around. You help me hold them off while I attempt to get through to Go'el!Speak with me when you are ready, and I will take you to him.29330The totems, ! We need to activate them, or Go'el is lost!Kill the elementals next to each of my totems, located around the edges of this plateau. Once all four totems are activated, we should be able to free the last piece of Go'el's soul!29331Before he passed through the portal to Mount Hyjal, Thrall asked you to follow him. There is something he would like you to witness.29332The lilies that grow around Stillwater Pond can be rendered down into a delightful broth.Well... by \"delightful,\" I mean \"won't immediately sicken any orc who drinks it.\"Why don't you go gather some for me, hmmm? Just watch out for the giant flesh-eating tadpoles.29333The orc guards are always grumbling about bland and moldering Undercity fare - as if it's OUR fault they can't get by on a diet of mushrooms and old corpses - so I think it's time they learn just the sort of exotic delights we can cook up when we've a mind to.Gather some of the freshwater snails ambling about beneath Brightwater Lake and I'll show them what a true culinary master can create.29334For all the grousing those Kor'kron Overseers do about Undercity food, there's ONE thing they'll eat in spades: My sister Audrey's Thrice-Spiced Crunchy Stew.Its popularity means she's always running low on ingredients. Could you gather some for her at the coach she sells them from?You'll find traps all over the city; just take their contents to Audrey and she'll handle the rest!29335, I refuse to believe my Go'el is lost forever. His spirit has been scattered across the elemental planes. If even a part of him still exists, we can find him, but I will need your help.We will start with the plane of air.Speak to me and we will travel to the Vortex Pinnacle together. We must speak with an elemental, Cyclonas. He's capricious, but he sees everything in the realm of air. If my love is there, Cyclonas will know what's become of him.29336Go'el must be in the plane of water... the Abyssal Maw itself! I shudder to imagine what fate awaits him there.Find the elemental, Hydrius, near the Abyssal Breach. He knows of Go'el and is sympathetic to our fight against Ragnaros. If anyone can help you there, it's him.I will meet you beneath the tides of Vashj'ir, ...29337Time is short! My love lies in Deepholm. I will take us there when you are ready, and we will speak with Therazane the Stonemother.29338We must travel now to the Firelands.

We are their only hope for survival.Go into the orchard and revive as many pilots as you can find.We will leave no one behind.29553Alright. According to the clues you found, that was Anduin's ship, and Admiral Taylor was the captain. And Admiral Taylor's last entry says he was going to fight off the hozen and protect the vessel after the shipwreck.The locals say these hozen sometimes take prisoners, and I didn't see Taylor's corpse anywhere among the wreckage. So you'll probably find Taylor at the hozen encampment to the northeast.Get going, we have no time to lose!29555Alright, soldier. I've got a critical mission for you.Get down to the coastline south of here - in the cove there you'll find a wrecked Alliance vessel. I need you to search it and find out if it was the ship that was carrying Anduin. Then, recover the Captain's Log and see if it has any information on where we can find him.Since the log is from a military ship, it'll be written using a cipher - take it to Nodd Codejack afterwards. He's keeping watch on the wreck from the other end of the cove.29556We've located an Alliance wreck to the south. Unfortunately, the locals have informed us that it's currently being scavenged by a group of creatures called \"hozen.\"By pillaging our wrecked ships, these creatures have already shown that they aren't friendly.

Find the keys and free our friends.29560Hozen skulls are prized tokens among my village.We use them to perform ceremonial rites, and the older the skull, the more potent its magic.Luckily for us, the hozen are careless, filthy beasts.

Still, they are stubbornly defending their homes as best they can.Search the village for anyone still on their feet and tell them to rally here at Hanae's place.29580They may not be weaponmasters, but many of these farmers can wield a simple hoe or a rake as an extension of their own will.That mastery coupled with the right motivation could muster a force capable of standing against the mogu.If you can bring back some tools from the orchard, I'll distribute them to anyone willing to fight.29581Ashyo must have experienced what we call the golden dream.Many of us working here have seen it, too - often after a long day of toiling in the pools. It is said this vision--and the feeling of elation it brings--is a reward to the mind for working the body.There IS an easier way, though we rarely resort to it anymore: a tea can be brewed using lotus root and dreamleaf, which grows around the shrine on the upper tier.Bring the dreamleaf to Yan back in town and he can brew the tea for you.29582Grek had bad night last night.Shiny mummy man came into Grek's house and told Grek that he had to go to Mana Tombs in Auchindoun.

I am Nazgrim.You are hereby ordered to present yourself to Garrosh Hellscream at Grommash Hold immediately.By his decree, all in service to the Horde are to swear an oath of allegiance to their new Warchief.Do not keep him waiting, .29612Lok'tar Ogar, old friend. It has been too long since last we spoke.It is good to see that you emerged safely from the depths of Vashj'ir.Warchief Hellscream has stationed me here in Grommash Hold.By his decree, all in service to the Horde are to swear allegiance to their new Warchief.You would do well not to keep him waiting, .29613Warlord Kalithresh is in charge of the entire Steamvault operation.I need you to kill him, . The naga have left us with no option but violence.Show him no mercy.29614The naga are working with leper gnomes to spread a horrific disease across Zangarmarsh. It's already spread throughout the Steamvault.Clear out anything that's been contaminated and bring me the central gear from Mekgineer Steamrigger, quickly!29615The Steamvault is the heart of the naga's efforts to pump the water out of Zangarmarsh, and Hydromancer Thespia personally oversees those efforts.Taking her out would seriously hinder their operation.29616We have not as of yet been able to stop the naga in the Steamvault, where most of their pumping infrastructure is located.Thankfully, the expedition I sent there is hard at work trying to change that fact. Will you travel to the Steamvault and offer Watcher Jhang and her crew your aid?29617People come from all over Pandaria to train at the Tian Monastery, just to the north of here. Probably because they never turn anybody down. They'll accept jinyu, hozen... or even a foreign  like you!My childhood friend, Lin, just joined the monastery's order a few weeks ago. If you're interested in learning how our monks train, maybe you should go talk with her!29618How strange, to have such a foreign-looking  visiting our temple. Are you here to study?You... you look very strong. You wouldn't have any trouble getting accepted into the monastery. You should talk to the High Elder, up on the balcony above.29619I heard, I heard! The High Elder wants you to train with us!There's going to be a banquet for us, the trainees... and you should probably bring a gift, as a sign of courtesy.The oranges in the grove south of the temple are extra-sweet right now. Bring some back, for the banquet.29620The banquet should be starting any time now. Go find the High Elder and pay your respects. I'll be right behind you.29622Hey, new ! Glad to see you survived the banquet! Trial One: Complete!You'd better speak up with Instructor Xann. He'll be expecting you for your daily exercises.29623Perfection can be achieved through repetition. Every single student in the training arena below will eventually perfect his or her form... assuming they don't give up first. This is a fact.I encourage you to join them, . As an honorary guest of the monastery, you are not required to perform the requisite 10,000 daily strikes. Simply follow the leader's example for a few minutes.29624Your next test also involves concentration and attention. I want you to practice your abilities on the training bags in the pit below.The bags are hung in groups of two. When I call out \"Left\", attack the bag on the left. When I call out \"Right\", attack the bag on the right.If you fail to follow my simple directions, this task will become much harder.Now beat on those practice bags until they burst, .29626We don't have many rules here, but we do have one particular rule that is worth remembering. If you want to eat......you have to work. Groundskeeper Wu can give you your chores for the day. He's in the market, to the west.29627First things first, though.A proper trainee needs a proper weapon. And a scrupulous trainee builds his own... or at least gathers the materials.The switches which grow nearby should suffice for any respectable weapon. You'll also need to shop for black walnut extract to treat the wood. While you're there, get some ale, for......well, you know what ale is for.29628Some of our trainees have... larger-than normal appetites. We have occasionally had difficulty supplying enough food for all of them. In times like these, we have to ask for help.A kindly older woman, who lives in a small house to the northwest, has agreed to make some stew for our trainees. All you need to do is go and get it.29629The black walnut extract you purchased from Miss Whiteblossom is but one of many extracts we keep in stock for various applications.Blushleaf extract can be gathered from the flowers in the Waxwood Forest to the west. Several units can be extracted from one flower, but only those with calm nerves and steady hands can remove all of the extract from one flower.29630The greenwood sprites in the Waxwood Forest to the west pose no direct threat to us, this is true. However, their numbers have increased as of late, as have their wily antics.Part of our duty as wardens of this forest is to maintain the balance. Your duty is to do so by returning these sprites to the earth.29631Might I ask a favor of you, trainee ?Before I came to the monastery, I was a stranger to battle. During my time as a trainee, I performed adequately, but I was never placed in any real danger. Now, as a graduate and a wage-earning guard, I am expected to protect this perimeter at all costs.I can handle greenwood sprites, but the tigers in the western Waxwood are something different altogether. Would you mind taking care of them for me?29632Alright, . I'd like to see what you're really made of.You'll find my pupils all over the monastery. Challenge them to fights. Push them to their limits. They have been instructed to do the same to you.Win or lose, you both will come out of the fight stronger.29633Upon the hills to my right, you will find a hozen named Zhi-Zhi. He, too, won enough sparring matches to move up the ranks. I think he will provide you with more of a challenge.Challenge him, and try to defeat him.29634The jinyu are long-standing allies of the pandaren, and we welcome any of their kind into our monastery. Husshun, one of their elder shaman, is one of our newest trainees.His skills as a monk are mediocre at best, but he is still a fierce combatant. He should provide you with the challenge that you deserve.29635You may have already met my best student, Xiao, at the banquet tables. I personally would have graduated him several times over, but Instructor Xann insists that he needs more discipline.If you ask me, discipline means very little if you win every fight you enter. I'm curious to see if Xiao can keep his streak alive against you.29636I have taught you everything that I can, . It is time you spoke with Instructor Myang.The fights that she stages are less traditional than the sparring matches I am used to. Nevertheless, the path of a traveling adventurer like yourself is unpredictable, and a broad knowledge of fighting styles is an admirable trait.Farewell, , and best of luck on the remainder of your training.29637Master Stone Fist has trained you in the art of one-on-one combat. Now you learn the art of one-on-many.How does fifty sound?Lower yourself into the Ring of Inner Focus below, then, when you're ready, set off this firework. My assistants will come at you, several at a time.All you need to do is survive.29639You have passed every test we prepared for you, . It is now time for you to move on to bigger and better things....but not before another banquet. The High Elder will be waiting for you at the banquet grounds to celebrate your graduation from our monastery.29640The Shadow Council has already killed most of our spies, but To'gun was foolish enough to escape only to go back in!You must find him. He may be reckless, but we need to find out what he knows.29641They've been torturing me, trying to get me to tell them everything that I know.They fed the others to Hellmaw, and I was to be next. But I told them nothing!They're using special devices to make their summoning more powerful. You must steal these devices!29642I have spies within Auchindoun and they have been sending me disturbing reports.  That place has been nothing but trouble ever since it exploded a couple of years ago.Something in there has gone horribly wrong - again - and the Shadow Council is now on a war footing.  Though the reports were lacking on details, their preparations appear to be directed inward.You must make your way to the Shadow Labyrinth.  My field commander, Mahfuun, will fill you in on what needs to be done.29643Two years ago the Shadow Council summoned forth a being that shattered Auchindoun in its wake.Read the Codex of Blood to find out what happened. Be warned, Grandmaster Vorpil guards it with his life.29644The Shadow Council has lost control of the cosmic being that they summoned here almost two years ago.Known only as Murmur, it threatens to overrun the Shadow Council and break free into the outside world!29645When the Cabal found our spies, they fed them to Ambassador Hellmaw one by one.Our men deserve justice. Slay the ritualists binding him, then dispose of Hellmaw.It is a most deserving fate.29646Well, I've done all that I can with you. Sounds like the others have, too.High Elder Cloudfall will be waiting at the banquet grounds, ready to celebrate your departure. Not that we're happy you're leaving... he just enjoys celebrations.29647The Rumpus was your final test. You have mastered the disciplines taught at this monastery.Just as your training began with a banquet, so shall it end. High Elder Cloudfall should be waiting at the banquet grounds. I'll be right behind you.29649Gunny is dying from a powerful curse, .Grand Warlock Nethekurse augments his power with a pair of mystical braziers. If you bring me an ember from that brazier, perhaps it can counteract the dark magic?29650Caza'rez is dying a coward's death.Grand Warlock Netherkurse placed a terrible curse upon him. Perhaps if you were to bring me one of the embers from his braziers, we could use it to counteract the magic before it's too late?29651Their elite warriors are ruthless... so... powerful.You have to kill them... or we will never defeat Kargath...29652Ol' Gunny doesn't have much longer...Do me one last favor, and kill the biggest, meanest fel orcs ye can find.For old times' sake, aye?29653Kargath was once one of the Horde's greatest heroes.He now wears the false mantle of Warchief. Bring me his namesake weapon so that we can remember the champion he once was, rather than the monster he's become.29654There is only one true way to end the fel orc threat to Honor Hold and the Alliance.Their Warchief must be slain.Bring me his namesake weapon, so that we can always remember his death.29655Warbringer O'mrogg has killed more brave soldiers than any enemy I've ever encountered. He is ruthless, cunning, and extremely powerful.Take him down and bring me his warcloth so that we may fashion it into a banner and show them the fury of the Horde!29656Stormwind wants to see proof of our successes in the war effort.Rather than showing him body bags, I thought we'd present him the warcloth of O'mrogg, Kargath's fiercest warrior. Think you can handle him?29657The Mechanar employs my race's technology to create manacells, objects which provide great amounts of power.I need you to eliminate Mechano-Lord Capacitus so that Kael'thas' forces cannot harvest that power.29658One more task yet remains.Pathaleon the Calculator oversees many of his master's operations. He is personally responsible for much of the recent torment that has plagued this world.I ask that you eliminate him.29659I sense that one of my kind's artifacts has been taken and stashed away in the Cache of the Legion.We cannot give them time to discover its power. If you would kill the Gatewatchers and retrieve it for me, I would be most grateful.29660Kael'thas' forces in the Botanica were unsuccessful in handling the numerous creatures contained within. We must take action to right their wrongs.The first step is to eliminate their forces so that they cannot cause further problems.29661Through meditation, I intend to find a route to locating Shu. In the meantime, you would benefit from practice and discipline.Your first task is the task of all trainees entering the pools: cross the balance poles to the west and ring the bell without falling into the pool.Should you fall, the pool's curse will make it difficult to get on a pole again, so you will need to return to the edge of the pool to start over.Oh, and beware the cranes.29662Gather me reeds from the nearby pools.Do not question why. Do, and then observe the results.29663I require peace to perform my meditation. Practice your arts while I meditate on Shu's location.Other monks practice balance and combat upon the balance poles in the surrounding pools. Engage them and defeat them.29664You're strong of mind and strong of will, but you lack the skills to face me in combat. You must fight with your body, but in truth, it is your character that is being tested.Let us even the playing field.Take this torch, light it in the brazier next to me, and then use it to light the three unlit braziers around the pool.29665After their ship crashed, evil creatures swept up from the sea to pick through the wreckage. Our aid may seem but a drop in the pond at the thought of the misfortune they've faced today.Defeat their tormentors. These people desperately need our help.29666There are dangers in the pools. The latest and most vicious are the water pincers. A time has come for their numbers to be diminished, and I am no longer up to the task.If you could clear out some of the water pincers, I would be very appreciative. Beware their numbers... sometimes it's best to lure them from the pool-side rather than wading all the way in.29667It seems that Kael'thas' forces have twisted the Botanica's specimens beyond saving. I do not want to see them unleashed upon Outland as so many others have.There is one, Laj, who I would like to examine. He is different somehow. Perhaps we can learn from him.29669I must now ask you to complete a most somber task.Warp Splinter used to act as guardian to all of the Botanica. He is now impure, and must be taken down.29670Thanks to you, there's a small militia of farmers hiding nearby. Hanae said something about giving them \"liquid courage\" which, I'm pretty sure, means they're sauced and ANGRY.The mogu think they can walk all over us - we'll give them a fight that will open their eyes.Follow the trail through the ruins and down to the beach. Find their leader. When you engage him, we'll be there to back you up.29674We imprisoned the most dangerous beings we came across in our travels.Zereketh is a powerful void lord. If he escapes into Netherstorm, he will feed off of the abundant void energy.29675Two powerful agents of the Burning Legion, Wrath-Scryer Soccothrates and Dalliah the Doomsayer, have begun rallying the demons on board together into a small army.You cannot let their forces grow any larger, or the Arcatraz may soon become yet another Legion stronghold.29676It seems Shu, the spirit of water, had a play companion when he came to the pools throughout the years. An old pandaren we know as Old Man Liang.Liang moved away from the main town and stopped practicing in the pools some time ago. I am told he lives in a small house northeast of here, up the hill.Liang may know what has driven Shu away, and where the spirit might be found.Go to Liang. Ask of Shu.29677Shu, the spirit of water, is eternally young, as are all the spirits of Shen-zin Su. I have been friends with Shu all of my life, but I no longer have it within me to play with him. I am old, and lack the energy.For all his complexities, Shu is simple to please: he desires friendship. When I returned to play with Shu each season, I would always bring a Sun Pearl as a gift, and then we would play together. You can find a Sun Pearl in the pools to the southeast. Perhaps you can be his new friend.29678Shu, the spirit of water, is sulking in the deep pool to the north. Cross the rocks and then drop the sun pearl in the center of the pool. He will know what this means.29679He wants you to play with him. Go for it!29680We have done as Master Shang asked of us. I will return to the temple to inform the master of our progress. You should continue south on the road to the farmlands to seek out Wugou, the spirit of earth.Ji awaits you at the Dai-Lo Farmstead, and he'll surely need your help. I must warn you, Ji can be reckless in his directness. Remember well the things I have taught you: discipline and patience.29681Harbinger Skyriss is the heart of the problem in the Arcatraz.He corrupted Warden Mellichar and made him release many of the prisoners. It is only a matter of time before the Harbinger himself is let loose., you cannot let a servant of the Old Gods live!29682We recently sent in an expeditionary force to the Magisters' Terrace to stop the Legion forces there.However, we haven't heard from them since, and I fear the worst.Will you go there and try to find Exarch Larethor? He's in charge of the expedition.29684We've had a contact embedded in Magisters' Terrace gathering intelligence for us for some time now, but we've lost contact with him.The information he was collecting is vital to our mission.29685As you've now witnessed, the Legion forces work tirelessly, manipulating the Sunwell's power to achieve their malevolent ends.Kael'thas has risen from the ashes of defeat and once more leads them in their efforts. He must be stopped.29686We cannot afford to lose this war. I'd like to empower our sentries so that brave men and women don't have to die.The Legion has gotten a hold of a powerful elemental being. Its essence could be just what we need.29687The Legion and Kael'thas' forces are becoming increasingly intertwined. This concerns me very deeply.From what we can gather Selin Fireheart and Priestess Delrissa work closely together to unite the two armies. You need to stop them.29688I mostly listen, . I listen so that the Warchief doesn't have to.I've heard of the status of our campaign against the Hellfire Citadel. It is time to take the Shattered Halls, seat of power for the fel orcs.Go speak with Stone Guard Stok'ton, he's in charge there.29689The time has come to lay the final blow against the fel orcs.Advance Scout Chadwick awaits your presence inside the Shattered Halls of Hellfire Citadel. Make haste, their forces could strike against Honor Hold at any moment!29690You smell that, ? It's the smell of our home, the lands our kind have bled and died to preserve.And listen... you hear that? It's the sound of peace and safety - a haven we've carved, where our enemies fear to tread.Remember these things. You won't experience them again anytime soon. We have ourselves a war to win.Now go get settled, we're shovin' off!29691My people use sanguine hibiscus for a number of purposes.It grows naturally only in the Underbog, and many of the bog's denizens have taken a liking to it.If you could bring me some, I would be very grateful.2969229694They have an airbase! I have underestimated this Alliance Captain for the last time. So many good warriors lost...There must have been a few survivors who were able to bail during the crash. We need every able-bodied fighter we can get.Find as many survivors as you can in the forest below, and I will investigate the wreckage itself. Rally everyone together at the nearby village for a counter-attack.2969529697296982969929700297012970229704297072970829709297102971129716There is a witch in the woods but no one believes me. She turned my friend Shin into jade!We were all so scared we tried to run back but she sicced her big jade monsters on us. A bunch of my friends tried to get away by climbing trees.Can you help me save my friends?29717I tried to fight one of the jade tigers in the woods but they were too scary. They stare at you and you turn to a jade statue!Honest truth! Chen's sister's friend Ni heard it from Kai's mom.I want to be brave like you though. Can you show me how to beat up those jade tigers?29723The Jade Witch must still have Shin.I... I can't do it! I don't want to see the witch. Can you please go talk to her and see if she has Shin?You're an adult, I don't think she would try to turn you into jade.29725Yeah, we found Amber, she's alive, and all that. That's about where the good news stops though.Let's see if I can pick up where ol' Rell left off...29726I... I can tell you what happened next! We continued north, into the forest...29727The final leg of our journey took us west, to a large hozen village. We set up a small camp in the mountains, outside of their line of sight...29730I bet I know your first question: \"What the ook happened to Sergeant Gorrok?\" Don't worry, don't worry. He's totally alive. Not dead or anything.Well, we THINK he's alive, but he ALSO might be very, very dead.Fine! Let me tell you exactly what happened.29731MOST of what Riko said is true.We didn't dare pursue Gorrok - the Horde's numbers here are far too few. Our forces can only sustain so many losses, and frankly, we don't know how powerful that witch really is.Let me pick up where the hozen left off...29733Please, . You need to hear what we've been through.The whole damned Alliance needs to hear what we've been through.

Clearly, this land has a deep history, which means it could not have been born of the cataclysm.And yet these waters have been explored for ages now, with no record of anything here but open sea.Perhaps if you were to sketch the pieces of this broken statue, you might shed light on the continent's origins.29745297472974829749Please... help... heart of the ruins... a ritual... conjuring......should not be here...My staff... on the altar... take it. Please hurry.29750The Spiritclaws are a sect of mogu assassin-priests who, at the height of the mogu empire, were the most elite and most feared of the emperor's troops.All have mastered a deathblow which ensnares the spirit of the enemy, trapping it in a jade bottle for delivery to a Spiritbinder.If you encounter any Spiritclaws further ahead in the ruins, take note: their belts hang with a cursed weight.Relieve them of their burden and bring the bottles back to me.29751So many spirits held in captivity here... I can feel them everywhere. Even the walls are a cage for the long-dead., we cannot simply break the sorcery over this place - doing so would release countless agonized souls to wander the earth. They will need a beacon, something to guide them.With your help, I can create a tan-chao: a bridge from this world to the heavens. For this ritual, I'll need a bowl, a candle, and a jade cong. You should be able to find them all within the ruins.29752The process of mass conjuring, as the mogu are doing here, is not without byproduct. Some spirits arrive too distraught or unruly to be harnessed, so they are confined and left to wander until their desperation leaves them more malleable.I suspect the mogu have such a holding area somewhere nearby, likely guarded by spiritclaws.Please, take my staff again and use it to collect these wayward spirits. You needn't fight them - present the staff and they should be drawn in.29753I'm afraid I have another favor to ask, .The bottles you recovered contain neither the spirits of mogu ancestors nor recently slain foes; they contain spirits of beasts. It seems the spiritclaws have resorted to poaching in an effort to fuel their simulacra.This complicates our task, for I cannot take the beasts with me through the bridge.Take the bottles west to Tideview Thicket and smash them to return the spirits to nature. Some may be blind with rage and will need to be subdued.29754We are ready to open the tan-chao and guide all of these spirits back to peace.If I may, I would have your assistance once more. The mogu will surely sense the ritual taking place and will do everything in their power to halt it. I need only a few moments without interference, and once the path is open it will surge too greatly to be closed.If you are willing to help one more time, please accompany me to the ritual site.2975529756I'm almost ready for the ritual, there's just one more thing we need: An offering.Relax, I don't mean a sacrifice. Just a bit of food.There are sure to be mushrooms growing in Tideview Thicket to the northwest that are suitable for this. Please bring some.29757Have you heard about the crisis we're having at the pools?Toads have moved in and are spawning like crazy! It's become a real problem for the lotus farmers.Coincidentally, I make a jam out of gelatinous toadspawn. I call it \"Bottletoads\" and it's a big hit with the kids around here. Can't keep any in stock.If you're heading to the pools, you'd be doing everyone a favor by uh... liberating some of those toad eggs.Into this bottle. For me.Just look for bubbles and scoop right in!2975829759I hope you are capable of this next task, for our lives depend on it.There is only one key that will unlock our chains. Unfortunately, the key hangs around the neck of the hozen's pet tiger, Kung Din.They keep the tiger in the great pit to the north. The only way to retrieve the key will be to kill the beast.29760There must be more to being a master pit fighter than this...Perhaps Korgol Crushskull who runs the Darkmoon Deathmatch at the Faire will know.2976129762We recently lost a fierce battle against the hozen at Moonwater Retreat.We evacuated as many of our people as we could, but still, there were many we could not save.We have no tokens of our lost over which to send our prayers.If someone could go and retrieve heirlooms from the dead bodies, we could properly lay them to rest, and move on.It would mean so much to us if you could do this, .29763The vrykul are fearless in a fight. Seems they actually yearn fer a death in battle. With their numbers and that ferocity, we're doomed - plain and simple.There's one they esteem though, goes by the name of Ingvar.

It's simple really. Let's make a ruckus so loud that there's no way he can sleep through it.Why look at that, a conveniently placed gong! Makes me think this may just be how they've awoken him in the past. We just need the matching mallet to get it ringing as loud as possible.The village leader tells me the mallet is over at the Ki-Han Brewery on the river, to the southwest. It's not far. Mind picking it up for me while I give the village some fair warning?29769I'll keep trying to find ways to wake this stubborn little guy up, but there is no shortage of trouble on the island it seems. The crops to the south are infested with virmen, rabbit-like thieves and pillagers.Rascals!They breed faster than we can kill them! I have the perfect solution for such a situation: kill them faster! With you here, , that shouldn't be a problem.29770The virmen to the south have been running off with all of our crops, but they're taking more than they can eat. They must be stockpiling them somewhere - the ones they like anyway.Will you go out and recover any of the uprooted crops you can find? I've got an island's worth of people to feed, and every single vegetable makes a difference.29771Gather me wood planks from construction near the Ki-Han Brewery.You do not yet know the extent of my strength, so I shall display it to you.29772You ready for this, ? I'm thinking maybe we should have looked for something to cover our ears, but it's a bit late for that now. Just remember that the intense ringing you'll be hearing for the next few hours is the ringing sound of victory!The honor's all yours, . Ring the gong whenever you're ready!29774Alright , I was thinking about what we'd try next if the whole gong thing didn't work, and it came to me just like that! Water in the face always worked on me. It's got to be twice as effective for someone so dry and earthy!Mind going over and asking Shu, the spirit of water, if he'll help us out?  He should be playing in the pool next to the waterfall, just on the other side of that tree.29775Well, that wraps it up here, doesn't it ?  Now that we've got these two roused and all friendly towards you, we just need to get them back to the Temple of Five Dawns.You go ahead. I'm going to say my goodbyes, then I'll follow you up shortly.29776The fourth and final spirit is Dafeng, the spirit of air. When he is not in the skies, he can be found on the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the west. I've sent both Aysa and Ji to help you find him.When you are ready, I will summon winds to carry you to the top of the temple. From there, cross the bridges to the west and find Ji in Morning Breeze Village.29777The hozen have stolen our brushes and are painting over our scrolls of wisdom with their own wisdoms, if you can call them that. If you're here to help, stop them and bring our brushes back before they can do more harm.29778, we must help Elder Shaopai. There are few more deserving of our kindness.On the way here, you surely noticed the scrolls of wisdom hanging in the grotto to the south. The hozen have defiled many of them, and sadly, they are not recoverable. We will deal with the problem directly - burn the defiled scrolls. Wipe the hozen writings away entirely.Do not worry for Elder Shaopai. The people shall come together and help him rewrite the wisdoms in time. I shall see to that.29779Alright , this is the second time we've had to deal with ravaging hozen. I think it's time we take care of this problem the Huojin way. No more patience. No more mediation. We go to the source.We're going into the hozen village to the north and we're punishing those smelly troublemakers. I've been looking forward to a chance to fight by your side again, .29780, I need you to understand that the way of the Huojin is not the way of violence. When fighting is needed, we will not hesitate, but when fighting is not needed, neither do we instigate. However, the direct solution is often cutting the head off the snake, as they say.The hozen have a leader instigating these attacks. If we remove Ruk-Ruk, we won't have to wipe the hozen out entirely.I know you are not of the Huojin, but are you with me in what must be done, ?29781The monkeys have been stealing from the village during their attacks. We should be fine without some of the extra food stores, but the idea of monkeys with fireworks... I'm a little bit concerned. Not to mention, who knows when some fireworks will come in handy?Help me recover the stolen fireworks from their village, ?29782This giant jade tiger pillar doesn't seem to fit in amidst the hozen buildings.What it does seem is very hard. Very solid.You know just the person to bring this to.29783Gather me stone blocks from the Ridge of Laughing Winds to the south.You have seen my strength twice, yet I still spy doubt within your eyes. It will not last.29784Aysa has been meditating on the lake since we've arrived, all her thoughts focused on Dafeng. I don't know what she hopes to discover out there, but she's no fool, and Master Shang Xi has entrusted this task with her.You will need to cross the ropes leading from the end of the dock to reach her. It shall test your balance, but I think you're up to the task, .29785If you listen long enough, the wind will carry the answer to you.Dafeng, the spirit of air, has been scared from the skies by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. He hides within the Chamber of Whispers, at the south side of the plateau.Go to him. Ji and I will join you there.29786Dafeng, the spirit of air, is terrified by Zhao-Ren, the Onyx Serpent. We must help him face that fear, or face it for him ourselves.When I told Ji of the serpent, he said he had an idea and would begin preparations outside of the chamber. Despite his rash nature, I must admit, I envy his passion and conviction.Let us go outside and confront the Onyx Serpent.29787The four elemental spirits will help you speak with the land and uncover its plight, but first, I have one small task to ask of you.Join me, my pupil. Accompany this old pandaren to the western grove.29788You faced forest sprites in the Dawning Valley, but the forest sprites in this grove are a different breed. Crueler and more dangerous.If you would clear some of these sprites out, the spirits would thank you.29789I am tired, . I must rest.We have a ritual to perform, but we require some of the charms from this grove. If you wander the grove, you should see them all over hanging from the trees. If it does not offend one as young as you, will you permit me to sit and recover my strength while you gather these charms?29790This journey shall soon be yours to undertake without me. Stay for a few moments and listen to an old man's words. Let my knowledge serve as a foundation for yours, that you might be greater than I ever was.29791Now is not the time to grieve. The balloon is ready, and Shen-zin Su awaits.We shall be the first pandaren to speak to Shen-zin Su in hundreds of years. It is a great honor.29792It is up to all of you to remove the thorn from the side of Shen-zin Su. Do not let your differences come between you. Trust in each other.Within the Pei-Wu Forest is a lone hermit. Head directly to his hut. He knows intimately of the dark things that now lurk in the trees.29793I do not know what this evil is that is infesting the forest, , but I know exactly how to deal with it. So do you, I think.29794Your friend has been doing everything she can to save my crew. I'm deeply appreciative.We're still dealing with more than we can handle here: quenching the fires on the wreckage, getting my people out, fighting off these evil sea creatures, and trying to prevent the prisoners from escaping. We're simply in over our heads.I still have men on the ship that we need to get clear before the wreckage collapses on them. I know this is asking a lot, but can you help?29795My men are malnourished, injured, and exhausted, but they are Horde. Every one will fight to their dying breath. As our new ally, we will stand by you when the time comes, but we would stand stronger with weapons.I have my men out gathering bamboo stalks to fashion into spears. If you can spare the effort, we could use the extra pair of capable hands.29796I'm sure Aysa won't love this plan, but it's the only plan we've got. Would you mind being the bearer of bad news for me, ? She needs to know what we're doing so she can get everyone to safety.29797We need supplies to tend to our wounded, but the supply crates containing them were scattered in the crash. If you can bring back any crates you find, I would be very grateful.29798, I was looking for you!One of the escaping sailors just spotted Aysa in the wreckage of the ship, facing some enormous beast. She might need your help - you should go to her, quickly!29799This is more horrific than I imagined, but we can handle this. We need to gather the healers and close the wound. We need to save Shen-zin Su.Find any healers you can! Rescue them, relieve them - whatever you need to do to get them over here healing the wound.Keep the healers safe at all costs!29800, I did what had to be done. And the plan worked. Things could have been much worse had we not acted. I only wish Aysa could understand that.There will be plenty of time for reflection, but for now, we need to return to the Temple of Five Dawns. We need to let them know that Shen-zin Su has been saved, and we need to sort out the fates of these new allies.29801Hello, !

We'll need to deal with them before any more Alliance show up.This one's taken quite a beating, but I've still made some determinations about its anatomy.With the proper reagents, I'll be able to fashion a poison that should be quite effective against this species. In fact, I'll just need to modify a bit of the poison I have with me.Go and find me some viscous chlorophyll down by the water. Any semi-sentient flora should do.29820I sent Warmage Kaitlyn into the Nexus to investigate the chaos that is Malygos' domain, but she hasn't reported back in days.Would you mind going there and lending her aid? I'm certain she could use help if she hasn't been eaten by dragons.29821Listen, .I sent out a coupla supply drones from the gunship, and they've all been lost or crashed. Almost all, that is.One of 'em buzzed right through the camp here and crashed out by them waterfalls.How 'bout you see what you can do about bringin' the contents of that crate back here, hmm?We're all outta drones, but my rocket boots might get come in handy... or footy, as the case may be.Hah!

They appear to be amassing for a major assault!We're going to have to take some drastic measures if we hope to see tomorrow.Here, take my poisoned throwing stars and figure out a way to thin out their numbers.29828One of the fleeing Drakkari trolls told me of a great raptor king, Dred, that was immune to the plague.If you could find King Dred and bring me one of his teeth, perhaps I could fashion it into a weapon.29829Listen to me, .It's just been brought to my attention that there's been an incident at the Violet Hold. It would appear that the blues are launching a full scale invasion of Dalaran!I need you to get to the prison and speak with Lieutenant Sinclari at once. She'll give you the details.That is not all. I need this handled with utmost discretion. We mustn't alarm the citizens of Dalaran if it can possibly be avoided. Do I make myself clear?Very well. Now, go!29830My forces are in absolute shambles, and Malygos' assailants just keep coming.I fear that the worst has yet to come.You must engage them until their leader, Cyanigosa, comes.

The Horde stands accused of stopping Alliance ships, boarding them, mistreating passengers, and stealing cargo.Heroes of the Alliance, your help is needed to determine the truth of these allegations! Seek out Grand Admiral Jes-Tereth at Stormwind Keep if you would answer the call.29832A ship called the Bravery routinely ferries passengers and cargo from Stormwind port to Rut'theran Village, right outside Darnassus.Well, the ship has just returned with distressing news. Both passengers and crew say that Horde vessels stopped and boarded the Bravery in the waters off Teldrassil, mistreated those on board, and stole some of the cargo before turning the ship around.We have to find out what happened, .

Perhaps the king will listen to their voices if he won't heed mine alone.Go talk to them, . Hear their grievances and gather their petitions before you return to Stormwind Keep.29846The Gilnean captain, Rufus Hardwick, would serve our cause well.The usual promises of plunder and booty might sway his crew, but to secure the good captain's help, we'll need to offer our assistance with a more delicate matter.Find an alchemist's shop and purchase a supply of diluted lime sulfur, extract of dogwood, and a soothing shampoo. Bring these items to the captain, but do nothing that will embarrass him.The fleet is depending on you.29847Just beyond this cave lies Ravenholdt Manor.

If there's anyone who can blow Horde ships out of the water, it'll be him and his crew.You'll find Blastbarrel in the Military Ward of Ironforge. Speak with him and see if you can convince him to commit his crew to our cause.29850The iron dwarves are busy at work carving out massive stone constructs that I fear will soon be used as powerful weapons.You must defeat their overseer, Krystallus, and the dark rune giants already walking the halls before it is too late!29851With this tournament we grow ever closer to our final confrontation with the Lich King., fight with valor and honor. Every fighter here has gathered for the common good.Together, we will stop Arthas!29852The third privateer we should hire for the fleet will be \"Swifthands\" Sutton, a notoriously fierce fighter in close combat. Where Blastbarrel loves his cannons, Captain Sutton prefers to close in for the kill.You'll find Sutton hanging around in Stormwind Harbor, looking for work. Be warned, he'll probably set some sort of task for you before he agrees to join us.29854Victory shall soon be ours! Our forces have engaged the enemy all over Kalimdor.Warchief Garrosh Hellscream has commanded all able-bodied s to report for duty in support of our latest offensive.Make your way to Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar and present yourself to General Nazgrim for immediate assignment! For the Horde!29857With most of our fleet leading the attack on Theramore and engaging the enemy elsewhere, we're going to need more ships to complete our blockade of Kalimdor.The warchief ordered the shipwrights at Zoram'gar Outpost in Ashenvale to work overtime to meet the demand, but none of the new craft have arrived yet.Travel there and put the question to their overseer. Tell them the warchief wants his ships!29859This is unacceptable! The warchief needs every ship he can get to secure Kalimdor!How DID the night elves find out about the new fleet in time to destroy it? There's only one way...Orgrimmar is full of the enemy's eyes and ears, , and it is our job to root them out. Belloc Brightblade has provided me with a tool that he says can help reveal the spies.Use it, but don't trust it alone. Use your judgment.29860I shall speak plainly to you, little . My people have not been the same since our ties with Thorim were severed.Volkhan will not rest until either he, or we, are no more.

What they are not ready for is to be attacked themselves.Now is the moment to strike. Take out General Bjarngrim and his army, lest they mount an offensive on all life on Azeroth!29863I have sent an emissary to the Halls of Lightning to take the battle to Loken.He undoubtedly needs assistance, given the strength of Loken's armies. Lend him any aid you can so that we may finally stop the traitor.29864We are hard at work ensuring that we minimize our losses to the Scourge war machine.The vrykul here are undermining that mission by willingly joining the Lich King's ranks.Please, brave champion, you must defeat their spiritual leader, Svala, before she leads her people into the eternal shadow!29865West of here is the Silkwood Road. It has fallen into shadow as the spiders there have turned to a more evil and gluttonous path.I would face these villains myself but someone has to defend the noodle shop from... um... dangers and such.Go, hero, and conquer these beasts! Should you succeed perhaps I shall regale you with some of my epic tales of heroism.I'll also pay you.29866Ah, welcome traveler. I have need of your services!Syra Goldendraft was looking for some silk. Personally I hate silk as it always gets stuck in my fur.I really want to impress her though.If you bring me some silk from the Silkwood to the west of here I will gladly pay you for your help.29867We need to fill the remaining slots in the new blockade fleet before the night elves can reestablish their spy network in the city.The Darkspears have yet to contribute much to the war effort, but if we can convince Shadow Hunter Urko'jin to add his forces to the fleet, that will change.Problem is, Urko'jin won't go to war without the blessing of the spirits. Pay a visit to Darkspear Hold in the Echo Isles, retrieve the totem of seafaring, and deliver it to Urko'jin in the Valley of Spirits.29868We'll need more ships to round out the blockade fleet, and I know just the blood elf we need.Captain Cartheron is his name and his men are some of the most experienced sailors in the Horde. Problem is, Cartheron and his men will want payment up front for their services.Bring your gold with you to Ratchet in the Northern Barrens and find out how much it'll cost to hire Captain Cartheron's crew and how much bonus pay he's going to demand.29871I'm not sure where Clever Ashyo got his \"Clever\" title from. All jinyu are clever, and I wouldn't say that he's any more clever than most of them.Quite the opposite, actually.At least he's a capable fighter. He did well enough at Tian Monastery to be selected for our training mission.If you want to help him look for the Hidden Master, you can find him along the Valley's northern border.29872Lin is more talented than she thinks she is. Strong of fist but weak of spirit. With more confidence, she could be better than all of us.Perhaps she will find the surety she needs on her trip into the west. She's probably on her way to Stoneplow as we speak. Stop and speak to her, if you find yourself on that side of the Valley.29873So... Ken-Ken. The hozen.Personally, I'm impressed he's progressed so far in his training. He's got a brain between his ears, which is more than can be said for most of his kind.He said he was headed east, but, seeing as we're already on the far east side of the valley, I can't imagine he went too far from here. Look for him at Zhu's Watch, in Krasarang Wilds, down the path to the south. See what he's found.29874Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths. His current path is as dangerous as any - he is headed deep into the Krasarang Wilds.I wouldn't normally ask a favor of a stranger, but... would you make sure that he is well? It would give me relief to know that a brave  was looking out for him.29875Kang's pride regularly becomes overconfidence, which often leads him down dangerous paths.

They was trying to GROW WHEELBARROWS.Please, while you out there, unbury our stuff.29879Now, back to your dilemma.I believe you can help your people build relations with our hozen, as my people have.The trail behind me will lead you to a body of water the hozen use to gather the fish that feeds them.Around this time every year, fearsome beasts call those waters home and many hungry hozen are lost to them.If you were to rescue some of the victims and gather some fish, perhaps you will be regarded more favorably.29881As you have seen, this grove is abundant with beautiful pink petals.  As each petal ages, the tone deepens and fades.If you would be so kind, I am in need of a few petals that have freshly fallen.  Only the ones that have just fallen will have precisely the right color I am after.From it I can forge an ink that will be breathtaking.  Can you help me?29882To achieve perfect paint strokes, one must have the right tools. My own have fallen into disrepair, their bristles becoming as unmanageable as hozu hair.Have you seen the wasps throughout the Arboretum? Their stingers can be fashioned into quills that provide just the right level of sharpness in each line.Could you gather some for me please?29883I've been thinking.We are cut off from support and a long way from home.Although these Pearlfin jinyu mistrust our presence, they do not appear to be hostile.If we could convince them that we are their friends, an alliance between our races could prove extremely valuable., you must go speak to the jinyu around the village.Convince their leaders that we are not to be feared, and that we only wish for peace.29885We do not have time to wait around for the Admiral to recover.Sully and I are planning to search for Anduin to the north, but we'll need supplies for our journey.The lake here is teeming with wildlife, which we have received permission to hunt.Go and gather some supplies while Sully and I finalize our preparations.29887Oh dear, oh dear...

I cannot guarantee what kind of reception you will receive, but he will almost certainly be as curious about you as you are of him!The Lorewalker lives in the forest to the southwest. Tell him that the Pearlfin have sent you.29889A delicious smell wafts out from the bottle on the table.A little taste couldn't hurt, right?29890The dream brew is complete! This time, when you drink it, you must embrace the visions you see from a state of inner focus.Follow me to my pagoda, and I will teach you how to achieve the inner calm that we pandaren value so much.Your troubled mind will present you with many distractions, but just remember to stay centered!29891To make the Dream Brew, we will need several ingredients.First, to improve its strength, I will need an ingredient from a fearsome creature, the legendary Mist Horror.It is said that this creature only appears where the fog is deepest.North and east of here, you will find smaller Mist Creepers roaming the swamps. Kill these creatures until the Mist Horror appears, and then bring me its heart.29892A brew's body is an important and often overlooked factor.To create the perfect consistency, I will need pristine eyes from the Bog Crocolisks to the east.Take care. The creatures are quite vicious.29893The most distinguishing feature of the Dream Brew is its iridescent, dream-like color.To the east, you will find Glittering Amberflies. I will need their wings to create the final luminescent color of the brew.Take this knife and use it to collect 8 wings.29894Our war against the hozen rages without end, and the future of our tribe is uncertain.This is why our waterspeaker has decided to seek wisdom from the waters.Elder Lusshan is waiting. Please deliver the instruments so that they may begin.29898I appreciate you coming all this way to save me, but Ren is gravely injured.The old pandaren had no reason to help me, yet still he risked his life to save my own.Before the fever set in, he mentioned that there are healing waters in the cave just down the hill.It is dangerous, but I will do anything to help my friend. Will you help me retrieve the waters?29899The spirits... the cavedwellers... they howl in agony... Trapped... in this world... cannot move... to the next.I... will go mad... listening... to their cries... Please...go...put them to rest.29900My father has dedicated his life to studying the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.The Vale is a mythical place, sealed after the Pandaren revolution twelve thousand years ago. We know so little about it!My father followed a trail of clues to the cave down the hill, seeking a very old poem known as the Song of the Vale, but he is in no condition to retrieve it. It is guarded by some sort of ancestor spirit.If you are heading that way anyway, would you mind bringing it back to him?29901You have done all you can for the Prince's friends.You completed your mission and found the White Pawn - Prince Anduin. Admiral Taylor and the other SI:7 agents will be eager to have the boy safe in their custody.It is time to return home.29903Elder Lusshan and I agree that the best path forward will be to work together.We will share with the Pearlfin our superior military knowledge and weaponry.In return, they will be a powerful ally should we again encounter the Horde.Take this crate of equipment and weapons. I need you to go around the village and equip the jinyu with weapons befitting their skills.29904I've prepared a team of bright young Pearlfin trainees who need field experience.Take them northeast, into the Bamboo Wilds, and kill any wildlife that you find.Don't bring them back until they're fit for battle.29905Advance scouts report that the hozen at the Slingtail Pits are amassing with reinforcements from their tribes to the north.Our forces are gathered for battle on the ridge to the northwest. They are just waiting for you.Now is the time to show them what we are made of. Now is the time to destroy them indefinitely.29906Despite the hozen's apparent disarray, there is an order to their chaos. Their leader, Chief Gukgut, is the shrewd mastermind behind their attacks.He is organizing their movements at the great pit at the hozen camp to the northwest.Strike now and show him no mercy, , for he will do the same.29907My niece and I are new to Pandaria. Probably like yourself. We're visitors from the Wandering Isle, and, to be honest, we have no idea where we're going.That farm up ahead looks as fine a place as any to take off our shoes and enjoy a brew. What do you say, Li Li?? Would you like to share the road with us?29908I apologize for the state of things around here. The virmen - those rabbity creatures, down the hill - have been pushing further and further into my family's farm, and our crops - which are normally bigger, and more delicious, by the way - have been suffering because of it.I'm no soldier... but you might be! Would you mind pushing some of these virmen off of our land?29909Your help here is appreciated, . I'd like to give you another job, if you're interested.My son, Ang, runs the small farm just down this hill. He should have brought me some fruits and vegetables this morning, but I haven't seen him all day.Would you go down there and see what's going on?29910I went off this morning to watch my papa fight the virmen. When I came back, the farm was full of marmots!I don't want to kill them, but we need to get rid of them. Hey, I know! We can close the holes!Fill in their holes with dirt, so they can't come out in our farm anymore.29911Here, . My father will be wanting this.Thank you, again, for helping with the virmen.29912Most of these vegetables will be sold, but I'd like to keep some for my family. Specifically, my nephew Liang needs some to feed to his pigs.Unfortunately, the pathway to Liang's farm is currently swarming with Snagtooth virmen. We're going to have to ask Miss Fanny to help us out.Bring some of the food we've gathered to Miss Fanny, who stands next to my house. Then ask her - NICELY! - to send them down to Liang's ranch.29913I told you earlier, my pigs are picky eaters. They need to eat meat to grow strong, but they don't like mutton, they don't like yak, and I'm not about to feed them any pig meat.They do, however, eat meat off of the mushan beasts, and they're also quite partial to turtle. Both creatures can be found in abundance to the west.My skills as a hunter are admittedly quite weak. Can you help out a young rancher and his pigs?29914I try to keep an eye on my stock, but every once in a while some of them sneak away. With all the confusion these virmen are causing, I may have let my guard down for a few moments, and some of my pigs escaped.Care to look for them? I'd start by looking down the hill, to the west.29915I'm not the only one having trouble with his stock, it seems. One of Francis' sheep has wandered over to my ranch, for the third time this week. I'm beginning to think he needs help tending to his flock.You should check up on him, neighbor. And bring this poor little thing with you.29916First the hawks came. You've probably seen some of them circling up above.The wolves came shortly after. I think they smelled my weakness.I'm not nearly as brave as Master Shang thought I was. The master will be quite cross with me if I don't do something about these beasts.Can... can you help, ?29917I've been thinking... the wolves might stop attacking if we kill their pack leader.We call him Lupello, and he patrols the opposite riverbank.29918Francis, you need to show bravery! You have everything it takes to make a great shepherd, except the courage to face your fears!You, stranger. You helped the rest of my family. Francis is like a second son to me.Show my apprentice what it means to lack fear. Use this rope to lasso and defeat one of the great white hawks above us.29919Hello again, . What is this, the fourth time we've run into one another already?Say... my keg is quickly becoming quite empty. I've heard mention of a brewery to the southwest, and that's where we're headed. Care to join us?29920My love, Lo, tried to get permission to marry me from the pandriarchs. Though they have passed beyond, their favor would carry a lot of weight.Thing is, they are spirits, and none of the gifts or tributes we brought impress them. To win their favor they claimed that either Lo or a champion must defeat them in single combat.Lo is a good man, but not a fighter.Would you be our champion?29922Lorewalker Cho came by and asked for you while you were gone.He needs your assistance urgently in the town of Dawn's Blossom to the north. For what reason, he did not say.Speak to Kitemaster Ut-Nam. He would be happy to send you there.29924Kher Shan is one big dooker.Grooked all my sons! Ick Ick, Nab Nab, Eet Eet, Bitty Bitty, and the others I can't remember.Wikket wanna help hozen? Go grook Kher Shan!The dooker's over there.29925Alright, I called in every favor I could. Here's what we got.Cho must be on to something big!Lemme know when you're ready to go see him - I got a ride all prepared for ya.29926You ever seen a shale spider, ? Usually harmless, just creepin' around eatin' rocks, but they got a taste for jade like cubs on candy. The boys call 'em \"nibblers.\"A few days back, we tunneled into a huge nest of these critters. They spilled out into the mines and went crazy, chewed up damn near everything in sight - including some of the boys.You get in there and clear 'em out, and we got plenty of jade to spare. The quarry is directly west of here.29927Look, this ain't easy... I got another favor to ask. My idiot husband, Hao, is a shift lead down at the quarry. I told him not to go back, that it was too dangerous, but he's as stubborn as a hozen and twice as stupid. Says the boys need him around for \"moral support.\"What about my moral support?! What am I gonna do if that idiot dies?!Please... keep an eye out for him. Tell him to come home.29928Our whole jade supply line has fallen apart. The mines are a death trap, morale is historically low, and - as if that weren't bad enough - the mason's quarter has been overrun by wood sprites!Now even the plants are out to ruin me!You need jade so badly, you can follow the road southwest to the mason's quarter and get it from those glorified chopsticks yourself.29929HNNNGHHH!!Let me guess: my wife sent you? Imagine that, my delicate little snow lily all worried. Ha ha! She's always frettin' over me. Look--HNNGHH!!!--it'll take more than a little--HNNGGHHH!!--cave-in to keep ol' Hao down.Some o' the boys, on the other hand, are in trouble. Help 'em out if you find any, will ya? I'll be fine.Really.29930Aw'right, so you need jade, do ya? I'd say we owe you at least that - we got plenty in the quarry, and thanks to yer help we should be back on schedule in no time.I should probably get back to the wife, so let's you and me take this cart o' the good stuff straight to her.Now, I ain't never met no  t'were too big for me to pull in a wagon. You climb on the back there and let ol' Hao do the legwork.29931You've done great here, kid. Thanks to you, we have quite a bit of extra jade, and I know just the someone who could use it.My friend Foreman Raike is running the great statue project at the Serpent's Heart.Bring a shipment of extra jade to him, and tell him his old friend Mann says hello. He'll be eagerly waiting your arrival.29932You've done us a huge favor here, traveler.Now that we have enough jade to complete the statue, we should send word of our progress to Yu'Lon, the Jade Serpent.When you arrive, speak to Elder Sage Wind-Yi outside the entrance to the Temple of the Jade Serpent.If you wish to speed your journey, speak to Kitemaster Shoku. I'm sure he can spare an extra kite for you.29933You really hozen friend, wikket? Let's see, hmm?Hozen at Grookin' Hill all outta slicky bait. Tigerflies' legs stay twitchy in water - make best bait!Bo Bo sick from stings. Wikket get bait and take to Grookin.29934If the egg is in Ravenholdt Manor, we can't risk torching it in an all-out assault. I'll need someone slippery to get in there and find out for sure.That's you, .Mostrasz will help you infiltrate the compound. Speak to him just outside and fly to Ravenholdt together. Good luck!29935Hmm, maybe wikket not so bad after all!Other baldskins not nice to hozen.Hozen take this from bad wikkets!All wikket loot goes to Kah Kah - Chief's orders!Here, wikket. You take it. Kah Kah will want to meet new hozen friend.His camp south at Grookin Hill.29936Welcome, wikket!

Hozen keep it safe for wikket.29937So these guys like fish, huh? Well how about we finish what you started and make them LOVE us?I've still got some explosive powder from the wreck, just need something to attract the fish.Guts is sure to do the trick - never fails. I saw some birds flyin' around south of town.Well? Whatcha waitin' for?29939There. I've plastered your bird guts over my explosives.I call 'em Gut Bombs, patent pending.Since you made friends with these fellas, how about you do the honors?Just light the fuse and throw 'em down by the shoreline!29940Alright, fine. I DON'T have everything under control here. I spent all morning fighting off virmen. I managed to clear them off of my property, but they got away with some of my crops.They took them down to the river, to the south. I have no idea what they're doing with them, but it's probably not eating them.If my father wants his delivery now, I'm going to need some help getting those crops back. Could you help me out?29941I recognize all you've managed to do here, . My report to the Warchief will include an account of your deeds.But there's no time to rest!This land must be charted and prepared for Horde settlement. I've already selected an away team to do just that.Find them before they grow comfortable here. Inform them of their mission, and try to convince your new friends to send along one of their own to serve as a guide.You'll be staying here with me. We have preparations to make.29942You think hozen crazy, wikket? Wait til you see hozen with no slickies!Not enough slickies for hozen and wikkets.Snappers! Hozen hate them ookin' snappers. Wikkets can eat all the snappers!29943Prince Anduin Wrynn. The very son of our enemy's king! Fortune has smiled on the Horde once again, .But there's another side of this coin. We'd be naive to think the child was left alone.Any Alliance scum within sight of this land must be searching desperately for their precious princeling.You and I are going to scour the area and root out his would-be rescuers.29944Before any kegs are tapped, we have work to do. These virmen are no different than the virmen on the Wandering Isle... a nuisance that breeds as fast as the rabbits they resemble.Sure, we could kill every last virmen we find, but what's the point in needless bloodshed? Let's just take out their alphas, and they'll slow down with their... reproduction.29945Uncle Chen says we're going to help this guy out with his virmen problem. Fine by me! I LOVE messing with virmen.Here's the plan: we're going to paint some turnips orange, and then we'll try to convince the virmen that they're carrots.This can only end in comedy.I'll gather turnips. You find something that we can use to make edible orange paint.29946We've dealt with the alpha males. Now, the alpha female.Virmen aren't terribly selective when it comes to breeding, but most broods will still have a dominant mother figure. She's usually bigger, meaner, and tougher than anyone else in the brood.You know, I wouldn't mind testing my skills against a warren-mother. Mind if I fight alongside you?29947Uncle Chen's still got his eye on me, which means I won't be wandering off any time soon. I guess it's up to you to take these turnips... I mean, \"carrots\"... into the Twisted Warren and deliver them for me.It should be pretty simple. Just toss the vegetables in front of virmen, then watch their reaction when they find out it's really a turnip!29948You and that Chen fellow are good people, helpin' out with the virmen like you are. I don't like to ask for favors, but I ain't gonna turn 'em away, either.While you're out there puttin' the hurt to those rabbit-men, you wouldn't mind keepin' an eye out for some bags o' hops, would ya? I'm pretty sure they lifted 'em last night.Probably usin' em for pillows, knowin' how they are.29949I'd say we've earned our reward. I can't wait to taste what Mudmug's been brewing.29950Uncle Chen asked me not to get into any fights while he was away... but that doesn't mean I can't go exploring. Finally, a chance to look around Pandaria without stopping every forty-seven steps for another rest!You want to come with me? I'll bet there's all kinds of cool places we can visit, not too far away from here.29951While you're just hangin' around, I might as well get you involved in my whole beer-makin' \"process\". Ain't much of a process, really... I just mix all the stuff together and wait.You probably heard - I like to use the muddy water from the riverbanks, to the south. Would you mind fillin' up this flask with that water and bringin' it back? I'll start gettin' the hops and barley all ready.29952Yes, I found the Stormstout Brewery... although I didn't exactly get the warm reception I expected.Do you want to hear the story?29966Look, !These Alliance dogs built a camp up on the ridge.Here, take my grog. Let's make a fire they can see from Stormwind!For the Horde!29967It's an emergency!Looks like you stirred up a hornet's nest killin' all them fish-folk.They're conductin' a full-on counterattack on Grookin Hill!I was hopin' to get some R&D time, but we're gunna hafta put my methane-grenade theory to work right away!Meet me on the east side of the fort, and bring yer throwin' arm!29968One word: Methane!We're going green. Clean burning, high availability, all natural, and will keep the druids off my back when we get back to our neck of the world.That, and I ran out of blasting powder...So, I need your help, .No, no, I wouldn't ask you to do the dirty work - especially not in front of the general. I'll collect these 'deposits' myself.You gather up some wood for an outhouse - I'm thinking long-term here!29971Hey, while you were out our scouts came back. And get this, they found some Alliance kid.You should probably go debrief them.29981I'm not from here. I've never even BEEN here before today. But even I can tell you that something's wrong.That wall over there was built to keep mantid off of pandaren lands.  Now, the mantid are sending their winged scouts over the top, as if the wall wasn't even there!The only reason those spindly scouts aren't dying is because they're attacking farmers, not soldiers. They wouldn't stand a chance against someone like you.29982A few farmers remain in the fields... some perilously close to the crumbling wall. I don't want any farmers pretending to be heroes. We will take care of this mantid swarm, and then they can return to their homes.My Shado-Pan are too busy defending this town to organize evacuations. You want to prove yourself useful? Get those farmers out of harm's way.29983We should be able to handle the defense of Stoneplow from here on out.Lin here is searching for someone she calls \"The Hidden Master\". I believe I know who she's talking about, and I have a clue for you.Go north.29984We will start with a test: The Trial of Bamboo.Your friend Lin failed this test.Follow me, and listen carefully to my instructions.29985The mist in this forest is a constant nuisance - one which I'm glad to hand off to trainees like you. Strange creatures lurk in the mist between these trees, and they must constantly be pushed back.Consider this part of your training.29986Trainee.Several wards surround us, hidden in the woods near my home. They are quite effective at dispersing the mist, but they require constant upkeep.You will find one to the north, one to the west, and one to the south. Find these wards and light them.29987You have progressed in your training, I think. Come with me, and we will attempt the Trial of Wood.29988I can sense your anxiety, but you are not ready yet. Your training must continue before you perform the final test. As for your task... I need you to fetch me some eggs.Yes, eggs. The marshland atop the hills to the east is home to a number of birds, all of which are generally peaceful in nature. You should have no trouble gathering enough eggs to last me several weeks.29989You have accomplished much in the short time you have been here, . I would not normally offer this test so soon... but I feel that you're ready.It is time you attempted the Trial of Stone.29990I told myself that, if I ever made it here to the Hidden Master, I would learn everything I could from him. This is my chance, . I'm not going to let it slip away.Still, I fear that Stoneplow needs us. I left early, before we were able to push the mantid scouts back. I'd feel better if you would check in with the Watch Commander for me.Oh, and if you run into the others, maybe you should tell them where the Hidden Master is...29992I'd like to go tell Xiao, Kang, and the others that I've found the hidden master, but now he won't let me leave! He says I have to pass that test of bamboo first. How'd you do that, by the way?It looks like, for the time being, I'm stuck here practicing my punches against this rock. And my knuckles are about to cave in.If you could gather some jademoon leaves, I could prepare an ointment and at least numb some of this pain.29993Have you seen my son, Lo? He was here a moment ago and I told him we were leaving today.I'm sure he's off trying to woo that young Syra Goldendraft. That is the very reason we need to leave!No son of mine is going to run off with a Goldendraft!I'm going to search around here for them.I do keep catching those two sneaking off to the Arboretum. Any chance you could head out there and look for them?29995The \"children\" you seek are not actually children but grown pandaren, despite what their elders might claim. Their love will not be held in check by the feuds of their families.You will find both Syra and Lo at the Shrine of the Dawn, ever seeking an answer to their dilemma amongst the pandriarchs of old.29997Since you were so helpful at the mines, would you be willing to help us with a small problem here at the temple?Wise Mari has been complaining recently of a disturbance in his temple.The water sprites have gotten quite playful recently, and made off with his ceremonial staff.If you could help him, I would be most grateful. I may even put in a word with the Jade Serpent for you.Just follow the path to the north.29998Lorewalker Stonestep is in charge of the entire temple library. Lately, something has been troubling him and his work.With thousands of ancient tomes to be transcribed, I can't afford to have him distracted.Would you follow the path south to the library and see what ails him?29999Have you seen the young serpents in the training yard?The littles ones tend to be mischievous, and some of them ran off to play before the training session.The Mistress will get angry if she discovers they're missing.Would you go find them and bring them back to me? I don't want them to get into trouble.They like to play out in the open, so look for them in courtyards and around the spires.30000You came to deliver a message to the Jade Serpent, right?I guess it's time you met her.30001Moths have infested the library. Moths!Any librarian worth his letters knows that moths are the most dangerous threat to paper, second only to bookworms.As it turns out, my assistants are a useless bunch of insect-fearing cowards.Please, you MUST help me get rid of the moths immediately! The works of a thousand pandaren storytellers depend on you!30002The worst possible thing has happened, .We. Have. Bookworms.This is a critical situation. All bookworms in the library must be eradicated at once to prevent their spread.We must squash this problem, literally! Please examine the infested books in the library and squash any bookworms that you find.30004You have helped us more than you can ever imagine, .I do not know what I would do if our precious scrolls were ever to be lost.Please return to the Elder Sage Rain-Zhu and tell him that the library is in order.30005Do you like fireworks, ?I love them! In older times we would set them off to frighten away demons, but I just like them because they're pretty!I think there are still some old launchers lying around the temple.Would you go set off some big fireworks for me? It would make me so happy!30006Despite our best efforts, the sha broke the seals around the main temple.If we cannot hold them back here, their darkness will spread to the rest of the Jade Forest.We need your help immediately. Kill any sha creatures that you see. They should not be difficult to find.3000730011Please tell the Elder Sage Rain-Zhu that I will begin my work at once.30015Blood and Thunder! My axe hungers!We won't return to Orgrimmar until every last Alliance is purged from this land.I will train these natives myself, if I have to. One way or another, this land will be made ready for Horde settlement.In the meantime, their chief gave me this to pass on to you - a map and a message in some fancy script.Do what you must, but be quick about it.War is brewing...30027First, you will need a weapon suited to your talents. Retrieve a staff from one of the weapon racks below, bring it to me, and show me that you know how to equip it properly.30028Since you are heading south, can you try to recover some of the grain that these thieves made off with?We saw birds and sprites running off with entire bags of our best bulk stock into the fields east and south of here.30029So... we bought some cheap grains in bulk. It turned out the grain was infested with sprites.I HATE sprites. With their wee beady eyes and constant smiling.I would like to resolve this quietly. Can I buy your services to discretely eliminate some of these grain thieves?30030Just to be clear, what happened was an accident. What I did, I did for INDUSTRY!There was no way I could have known that a sprite invasion would happen at any time, or that one of them would try to eat my new \"Pan's Miracle Gro\" formula.Now not only do they have a big sprite leading them, but he's one angry beast.If I pay you, will you take him out?30031As long as you're here, you might as well help me out. I'm feeling pretty darn unqualified for the task, seeing as I've never drank a drop of beer in my life.You should try a little sample of each of their grains. Let's see if any of this stuff is sweet enough for Uncle Chen.30032Looking for sweet grain? My father once mentioned a malted cave barley that sounds about right.If you are willing to brave the peril, there is an ancient cave at the base of the Winds' Edge south of here.There is even an old lift my father made when he would travel into the jungle.In the cave is a bush as old as my family. From that bush you can pluck a grain so sweet it will humble your senses.Just watch out for its guardians.30033First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve a spellblade and a hand fan from one of the weapon racks below, bring it to me, and show me that you know how to hold it properly.30034First, you will need a weapon suited to your talents. Retrieve a crossbow from one of the weapon racks below, bring it to me, and show me that you know how to hold it properly.30035First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve a mace and a book of prayers from one of the weapon racks below, bring them to me, and show me that you know how to hold them properly.30036First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve a pair of daggers from one of the weapon racks below, bring them to me, and show me that you know how to hold them properly.30037First, you will need weapons suited to your talents. Retrieve an axe and a shield from one of the weapon racks below, bring them to me, and show me that you know how to hold them properly.30038First, you will need a weapon suited to your talents. Retrieve a sword from one of the weapon racks below, bring it to me, and show me that you know how to hold it properly.30039Freshly arrived for your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30040Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30041Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30042Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30043Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30044Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30045Fresh to your training, your first task is simple: Speak to Master Shang Xi.30046You know what? I don't have to take this.I'll show that Uncle Gao what it means to be a real brewer. I'll brew the best beer he's ever tasted, with ingredients I've never even used before.I'm Chen Stormstout, and I'm the best brewer alive.30047Uncle Chen is going to love this. Or... he might tell us to find something sweeter. He's kind of dumb like that.Let's get this grain back to him at Halfhill.30048I'll let you in on my brewing plan, : I'm planning on making an Emperor Stout. Done right, it should be dark, roasty, and high in alcohol.I just realized... I never told my plans to Li Li. She'll have no idea what type of grain to bring back!Could you speak with her? I need her to bring back the sweetest malted grains she can find.30049Would you mind checking in on Mudmug? He may need some assistance bringing that water back.I'm sure he'll appreciate the help of a big, strong  like yourself to help him shoulder the load.30050You want me to just GIVE you some hops? Pfshh! This is the third time today some little  like you has come up to me asking for food!You want food? Then you'd better work!Now go water my plants!30051Look at it, : the Gilded Fan. I heared lots of good things about the water they got here. Lots of bad things, too.No sayin' what kind of water Chen's gonna be needin', so what say we make him a little sampler platter?Come on, let's get movin'. We'll go scoop up some water together.30052You want some hops? I've got plenty in the shed out back. I'll gladly share some with you... if you'll help me weed my field.Now \"hop\" to it! Get it?30053With Li Li fetching grain, and Mudmug handling our water, all we need is hops, and some good wood barrels. I'll handle the barrels... but I need you to gather the hops.I don't know much about the hops from this land, but I'm sure the nearby farmers have something worth brewing with. Go see what you can rustle up.30054Virmen, they bite too much.They bite Mung-Mung's carrot. They bite Mung-Mung's pumpkin. Mung-Mung try to shoo them away, and the dookers bite Mung-Mung's tail and foot.Enough is ookin' enough.You fight way better than Mung-Mung does. Bring back their bitey teeth. Then we see who does the biting.30055All three farmers have delivered their hops to Halfhill. Perhaps you should check in with Chen to make sure that he received them.30056Brave , you could not have arrived at a better time. My daughter is missing!I've got a suspicion that the virmen took her down into that stinking little warren of theirs. I'm too old to fight virmen, and my farmhand is already exhausted from fighting them off all morning.Could you look for her?30057Those virmen... they make me do horrible, horrible, silly things. All involving carrots. I couldn't tell you how many carrots they threw at me.Let's not waste any more time. Get me out of here!30058The esteemed Journeyman Chu would appear to have created a monster. It is silken death with wings.Mothallus.You have already faced its brood. Now we ask that you help us face the creature itself.Please, , venture into the pit and rifle the bait. This will bring the beast to you.Our mothfighters will assist you as you need, though silk tends to stick to them more than most so you may need to help them, should they become overwhelmed.30059Oh... oh good! A ! Could you help me?I created a strain of vile monsters during my experiments to improve silk output.The result was a full-scale moth rebellion. Can you use your iness and destroy some of these mutants?30063The sha may seem unstoppable, but this is not true.Their masks seem to be the source of their power. When a sha and its mask are separated, the creature's essence is banished back to its own realm.Bring me intact masks, for I wish to study them further. Do be careful. I'm sure the sha will not part with them easily.30064My adepts had to abandon their studies when the sha invasion began.Unfortunately, they left their books scattered around the temple grounds. These priceless works of knowledge must be saved!The sutras can be found near the Training Pit and the Adept's Ring to the northeast.30065Our war supplies grow low, but especially needed are additional arrows.Our serpent riders are skilled marksmen, but they can do little without ammunition.We need someone to brave the battlefields and retrieve any undamaged arrows to refill our stores.Every arrow you retrieve will be used wisely.30066Our temple defenders have battled relentlessly for hours. No doubt they grow tired.I will give you mantras to deliver to our fighters.Do not be fooled by these pieces of paper. These ancient scriptures hold words of untold power.30067A terrible manifestation of the sha has appeared to the south.It is trying to destroy an ancient relic, the Bell of a Thousand Whispers.This bell has never been rung in the temple's history, for it is rumored to be an ancient instrument of power.Please go and defeat this demon where it stands! We must save this relic!30068Do you see the violent black and white flames erupting all around the temple?The greater our doubt, the stronger they rage. Unchecked, they will devour the entire temple.We have but one hope.Take flight on one of our war serpents. Fly it near the pure springs of water, and then douse the fires with water from the pools.30069Quickly and quietly; that's how SI:7 prefers to operate. That was the plan, at least.Rell Nightwind is already inside Garrosh'ar Point looking for signs of Anduin and Taylor, but it's getting hot in there and he needs support.Fight yer way through these dogs and find Rell!30070Alright . We've taken enough jabs at this warlock army... now it's time to cut off the head.Ga'trul's back there, in that big ol' temple ruin. Give him a good what-for, and the Horde will have lost its last stake here in Pandaria.30072Would you like to be a Silkmaster for a day?The first thing you'll need are fresh mulberry leaves. You can find them in our grove of mulberry bushes to the northwest.Next you will need to feed them to a hungry silkworm in our feeding pit to the west.And finally you should get some raw silk from our processing hut on the south side of our farm.Have fun!30073We have everything we need. It's time to start brewing.Pay attention, ... you might learn a thing or two.30074Now, onward to the Stormstout Brewery! It's high time that I was reunited with the rest of the Stormstouts... and what better way to reunite than over a few mugs of ale?You know where the brewery is, right? Just follow this road to the west. You can't miss it. Of course, you're free to share the road with us - we'll be leaving any moment now.30075Are you seeing this? Virmen, hozen, and water sprites... all pouring out of the brewery doors and windows! What the heck is going on in there!?There is another entrance, on the eastern side of the brewery. I'm going to run over there and try to figure out what's going on. In the meantime, see if you can't get rid of these creatures. There's nothing worse than a drunken hozen.30076I've heard lots of cockamamie rumors about this here brewery. I thought they were all false... until I saw that giant hozen.So, it got me thinkin', what if the other rumors are true? I heard this one rumor just the other day about some water sprites that run around inside the brewery, causin' a ruckus and whatnot. Their bodies are actually MADE OF WATER.I reckon a man could make some mighty fine beer with some fancy water like that. If you find any, could you bring me some?30077I can't believe that giant hozen! He's just throwing barrels everywhere!Barrels, man!It looks like he managed to get pretty much all the pandaren that were working out in front of the brewery. If I were you, I'd help some of them break out. Put some of those ridiculous muscles to use.We're headed over to the brewery's rear entrance, to the east. Meet you there!30078That's it, . I've had enough of this.If somebody doesn't do SOMETHING to take care of this brewery, we'll lose it forever. And there's far too much family history - and beer - in there to risk wasting.So... we're going to break in through the back door. You, Li Li, Mudmug, and me.It's gonna be a brawl in there.Let me know when you're ready.30079Pandaren always welcome travelers with open arms - and open kegs! But this town full of jerks!Everyone so busy sulking, they won't talk to Ken-Ken at all!Can you find someone in town who will talk to us? Maybe normal pandaren just hiding in the houses?30080My nephew, Yi-Mo, has always been sort of a downer. When this wave of despair hit the town, he took it harder than most. He sat around for days refusing to eat, just staring off into the horizon.Now he's wandered off toward the cliffs northeast of here, where the thunderbirds nest and hunt.Please, , will you look for him?30081Alright, Ken-Ken pretty sure he knows what wrong with pandaren! Got old, old hozen remedy that do the trick.Need to mix honey, fish oil, and salt. Ken-Ken saw lots of beehives in the trees around town, and there must be fish left in the dry ponds.That just leave salt... Mei might know where we can find some.30082Ever since this storm began, I've just been... tired.Not physically... no. It's like my very soul is exhausted. Worthless. Hopeless. I imagine it's what one feels when a mate leaves them for someone with a rounder belly, but I've never had a mate so how would I know?How can I claim to know anything? I'm worthless to everyone but these thunderbirds. At least they'll have a good meal out of me.30083With our grip on the province loosening, saurok from the wilds have already moved in to the cave just north of town.Most of our hunters are face-down in their own tears, so the saurok just walk in here like they own the place and grab whatever they want!I want to send a message that Zhu's Watch is not to be crossed.Will you be my messenger?30084Bonfires are surprisingly effective at discouraging beasts from wandering out of the wilds. We have three along the border to the southwest which we normally keep lit at all times.Nobody's been there for days, though, and the fires must be out by now. It's only a matter of time before the wilds creep back in and overtake the land we have kept safe for centuries.Please, re-ignite the bonfires. They are critical in keeping the province safe, and they are memorials to the founders of our way of life.30085We need to find out what's going on inside that brewery, !We may have cleared out some of the bigger pests, but I'm certain there's plenty more where they came from. Gather up a few of your friends, and meet me inside!30086Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs.I'm just a visitor... like you.Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I are trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards.30087Oh, hello. Are you looking for the owner of this place? Then look to the pandaren up at the top of the stairs. I'm just a visitor... like you.Now if you'll excuse me, my friends and I trying to decide something. We can talk again afterwards.30088Okay, so that not work. Well... it cheer Ken-Ken up! But pandaren still sad...We try another old hozen remedy - this time, we go back even further than gramma, way WAY back to ancient times. Hozen still do this sometimes... mostly at parties.Ken-Ken got woodworking to do - you bring him teeth! Not yours; big ones, like a panther would have!Oh, and some paint! Mei might know where to find.30089Well... THAT was unexpected!Come to think of it, now Ken-Ken remember why hozen use mask in the first place...A legend about the Monkey King says he used a mask to cure old pandaren emperor, Shaohao, when he was too sad to lead his people. Then they buried mask--with all his sadness--in the ground.We should use the mask on more pandaren, but instead of putting sad away in ground, we gonna PUNCH ITS BUTT.Let's do this, !30090Hmm... Is that Yi-Mo kid over there?It is! He's at the well, and he's not lookin' so good.Ken-Ken got a bad feeling about this...30091All of this started with our ponds. In a single day, all of the water retreated down into the earth. When there was no more water in the ponds, it began to fall from the sky.Despite endless torrents of rain, the ponds do not fill. It's as if the land itself thirsts and cannot be quenched.Now the ponds birth horrific manifestations of despair. Elementals made of water from the sky and salt from the earth; the tears of Pandaria.30092If you wish to join my cause and slaughter the black dragons in hiding, prove yourself by taking down Hiram Creed. He's amassing an army in Gilneas.We haven't been able to slip past his defenders, but we've got a man on the scene keeping an eye on him. Zazzo Twinklefingers, a very crafty arcane mage, is waiting for us to contact him just outside of the ruins of the Gilnean capital.Find him and he'll direct you to the target.30093The city has been in chaos for days now. Hiram Creed, disguised as a Gilnean, has infected the lot of those dogs with his own draconic blood. Even the Forsaken are having trouble routing him out.Only a surgical assassination can end this!The bridge behind me is relatively unguarded. Slip in through merchant's square and head south - you'll find Creed in the middle of the military district.I'll keep an eye on you and pull you out if there's any trouble....There WILL be trouble!30094Nozdormu, the bronze Aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the Horde. You are on his short list. I can share few other details.It is uncharacteristic of my master to request the assistance of mortals, but I suppose that all things change with time... even the Aspect of Time himself.He awaits you at the End Time, in the distant future. I can help you to travel there, if you so choose.30095Nozdormu, the bronze Aspect, has asked for help from the champions of the Alliance. You are on his short list. I can share few other details.It is uncharacteristic of my master to request the assistance of mortals, but I suppose that all things change with time... even the Aspect of Time himself.He awaits you at the End Time, in the distant future. I can help you to travel there, if you so choose.30096If we are to destroy Deathwing, we will need the power of the Dragon Soul. To obtain the Dragon Soul, I would have to take you back to the Sundering, ten thousand years in the past... but that time passage is blocked to me.The creature that blocks us from accessing this time passage is named Murozond. He must be slain, here, in this twisted future, before we can continue our plot to unmake Deathwing.This is why you were brought here, .30097From what I understand, you intend to avoid this future. If this is true, then we must archive data from this timestrand before it is lost to us.We believe that the most interesting and valuable elements of this future are the powerful \"echoes\" that roam the dragonshrines.Take this vessel with you as you silence these echoes. A portion of their energies will be archived within the bronze dragonflight's depository.30098We must move quickly, before any remaining Infinite agents intervene. Time is precious.I will now take you from your distant future into your distant past... the War of the Ancients. Our goal is the Dragon Soul, an artifact of immense power... enough power to break Deathwing, and end his reign over your present.30099Between us and the Dragon Soul lies a legion of demons. They will have to be dispatched before we proceed.If my timing is correct - and it usually is - a young night elf named Illidan Stormrage should be crossing our path shortly. He will undoubtedly be of some use when it comes to demon hunting.Help Illidan disable the demons' portals, then slay their leader, Peroth'arn.30100Queen Azshara and her royal guard lie ahead of us. We cannot afford the possibility of any interference with our plan. So we will take the fight to her, before she has a chance to meddle.It is quite unlikely that you will kill Queen Azshara today; very few coherent timelines exist along that branch. Consider it a victory if you are simply able to occupy her attention, however temporarily.30101I cannot simply fly up and grab the Dragon Soul. The old gods protect it.To make matters worse, their shield is strengthened by the swirling, arcane energies that emanate from the Well of Eternity, and those energies are being focused by the great demon Mannoroth.Distract Mannoroth, and the link between the Dragon Soul and the Well will be broken. Without the Well's power, the old gods' ward will be weakened, and the Dragon Soul will be vulnerable.And then I will take it.30102There's no need to stand around here forever. Have you forgotten? We can CONTROL TIME. Especially since you got rid of that Murozond fellow, back in the future.That Dragon Soul that you just liberated? Thrall already has it, back in your present day. And he's going to need your help.You ready to go?30103The Dragon Soul... a weapon with enough power to defeat Deathwing. Thanks to you, it is now safely in our hands.Come! The aspects await us. We must bring the Dragon Soul to Wyrmrest Temple, in the center of Dragonblight.30104You... , was it? You assisted with our archival in the past. Well, technically it was the future, but I believe you understand. Time is highly relative.I require more information for our archive. While you and Nozdormu don't intend to overwrite this timestrand, as you did in the End Time, we can still benefit from more data.I require information on Captain Varo'then, one of Azshara's pretty little handmaidens, and... hmm... oh, how about that big felguard, just down those stairs?30105The missive reads as follows:\"The Hour of Twilight is upon us. The world-shaman Thrall approaches Wyrmrest with the Dragon Soul in hand, feebly whimpering one final threat to destroy our glorious master.\"\"Stop Thrall, and we win our war. I will be watching you from nearby.\"   ~ The Twilight Prophet30106Prince Wrathion will be pleased to hear that you've succeeded. You should report back to him at Ravenholdt Manor.The Prince has been known to be extremely generous to those who help him.30107The daggers I have given you are lifeless shells. They can do great things, once they are given a means to contain the power I have in mind.I need for you to acquire Shadowy Gems for me. The facets of these unusual stones are like windows into the infinite. They are often used by minions of the Twilight's Hammer to control the most powerful of elementals.A great battle is raging around Wyrmrest Temple. Collect Elementium Gem Clusters from Deathwing's minions and bring the gems to me.30108Your next target is the Black Dragon Nalice, who is engaged in some sort of arcane debauchery beneath the ruined tower of Karazhan.Your primary mission is to destroy her, but if you can bring me back a vial of her blood, I'll be able to use it to augment the power of the daggers I've given you.Your accomplice Zazzo has already been dispatched to the scene and awaits you there. He'll have more details.30109I've pinpointed Nalice to the Master's Cellar, an extended basement you'll find in the ruins up ahead.Dragon cultists are everywhere, and Nalice has set up some strange arcane storage devices throughout the area. Perhaps you can use those to your advantage?Sneak past the cultists, obliterate Nalice, and grab a vial of her blood for Wrathion.I'll keep my eyes on you and pull you out if you get into any trouble. But I'm NOT coming in there with you!301103011130112Utgarde's forces are organizing under the advisory of Prince Keleseth, a san'layn ambassador of the Scourge.We cannot allow the vrykul to benefit from his counsel any further. Silence him.30113Done! You'll want to get this back to Wrathion as soon as possible, along with those two daggers of yours.I don't know what he plans to do with this stuff. Between you and me, sometimes that little dragon kid creeps me out. Good luck!30116Do you understand why I have you assassinate the dragons, yet spare the mortals? It isn't their fault. They must seek out their own destiny, free from the meddling of my kind.We are nearing the end of our mission, and it is time for you to seek out your own destiny as well. I can continue to augment your weapons, but collecting shadowy gems won't be enough. My work will require entire clusters. Gather them from my father's minions...30117Excuse me... ? Did I hear your name correctly?I've come from Stoneplow, in the west. They sent me to pick up some emergency beer rations, but the Stormstout Brewery is all boarded up!It looks like your handsome friend there - no, not Mudmug, the other one - has a few casks with him. Could you spare a keg for a town in need?30118Your next target has claimed the lives of all of my other assassins. I need you to kill my father himself.You must destroy Deathwing.We are out of time. His madness has already corrupted all the others of my kind, and his darkness will consume the world if he is not stopped.If you by some miracle succeed, and can retrieve for me a piece of him - perhaps a fragment of the armor he uses to disguise his true chaotic nature - the reward I give you will be without equal.30119I am duty-bound to look into your claims immediately, , which means my mission here now must fall to you.A surge of ancient magic, far too strong to have occurred naturally, drew me here. I have since discovered a most troubling development.A bough from Nordrassil has been ripped from the tree and taken deep into the Firelands. There, a powerful ritual threatens to corrupt Nordrassil, consuming it in flame.You must find a way to interrupt the ritual and reclaim the world tree's branch.30120'Ey, mon, you be here! Dis is good, mon!Drak'Tharon soon be cleansed of them foul undead and restored to her noble purpose. In return for your help, the keep's most valuable treasures be yours, mon!Once ya be reachin' its top, ya must summon me, and I'll perform the ritual.Alas, my summonin' will be comin' at a cost. Ya must collect mojo from the survivors.30121I sent a diplomat to look for allies in the ruins east of here.My diplomat has not returned and now Kang tells me this jungle is filled with a sinister people known as the mogu.Chezin is my friend and Leza's brother. To lose a brother would cause her to give in to despair. She already has enough to worry about with her fever.Could you investigate the ruins east of here and find out what happened?30122You have found a beautiful silver flask decorated with ornate filigree.  With the right materials and your skill in alchemy, it could become quite magical.30123Leza has a fever. No mother in labor should have a fever.Mama Bramblestaff once told me that Skitterer Stew could heal almost any illness. Let us put this knowledge to the test.Gather some intact skitterer glands for me while I get the herbs we'll need and I'll whip up a batch.30124These sunwalkers are a tiresome lot. I need soldiers with horde blood in their veins and honor in their hearts. Not some pacifist sun spirit filth.The Alliance are here, $p. Followed us no doubt, or somehow tracked the same visions Leza had that led us here. It doesn't matter. I don't want them to know how divided we are at the moment. Go kill their scout south of here before it can report back.Hellscream's eyes upon you.30127Mogu? They seem like the elves, ancient and an over developed sense of entitlement. Everyone of Azeroth must learn, sooner or later, that the Horde is not \"visiting\" this world. We are here. We are staying.Teach them this lesson. Quell their numbers in the ruins south and west of here. Break their amassing forces before they decide to attack.Learn what you can of how these creatures fight, and how they die.30128The mogu found the Pools of Youth!Mama Bramblestaff used to tell me old stories about those. During the mogu empire they would use the waters to extend life.Thing is those stories never ended well for some reason. As if the waters were cursed.Either way, we should investigate. There is a good chance those waters might help Leza.It looks like the Pools of Youth are on the northwestern side of the ruins.30129Mogu don't often gather in numbers like this. We should find out what they are up to.I thought I heard someone shouting orders near the center of the ruins.We should probably see if he has information.30130Kang's remedy isn't working.There is something else at work here. A power deep beneath the soil. It is sapping us of hope, hitting us with depression and despair.Kang tells me this land has lotus plants. I might be able to make a tea that would hopefully lend Leza some strength.Please, $p, search the ruins south and west of here for lotus leaves. I will pay you for your efforts.30131My child is coming. I must help as I may.Stay nearby, hero. If my wife and child survive, I would have them look on the face of the one who saved them.30132Leza now walks with the ancestors of this strange land. I must look now to the living.Kor has led a group of our scouts west deeper into the jungle.I sent a scout of my own to investigate the crane temple. Please, $p, seek out my scout, get their report, then meet up with Kor and lend what aid you can to him.We will join you as quickly as we are able.30133Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers.They should be told of what happened here.If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone north. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.30134Welcome to the Order of the Cloud Serpent, . I can see from the spark in your eye that you wish to join the Order.Let me get a good look at you.Hmm. I see honesty and earnestness in your heart. You have journeyed far to come here, but I am afraid you must go yet further.Your path into the Order begins now.Speak to Instructor Tong at Windward Isle to the northeast to take the first step.30135At first, the Slitherscale were too frightened to approach the wild serpents.Then, I caught them snatching the eggs under the cover of night.Now, they are slaughtering adults and hatchlings alike!If we do not do something, these gentle creatures will be completely wiped out. Then there won't even be an Order of the Cloud Serpent to join!Go and slay these vile Slitherscales, and then we will talk.30136When the attacks began, the young hatchlings scattered in terror.They are roaming around the island, lost and scared.If you want to help, take this rope and leash the lost little ones. Take them back to their nests. Return them home.30137Ahhh, I should have known! You have the look of a hungry initiate.I would gladly help you choose a serpent egg, but the Slitherscale have thoroughly raided the cloud serpent nests.I'm terribly sorry. I don't know what to tell you.Unless you're crazy enough to sneak into the saurok camp to the east and retrieve some stolen cloud serpent eggs, I'm afraid I can't help you.30138I have examined each egg, . Out of the lot that you brought me, I have chosen the three eggs with the most promise.You may choose only one egg to take with you. Are you ready to make your final selection?30139Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed.In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum.30140Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed.In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum.30141Excellent, just excellent! I will return the other eggs to their nests, undisturbed.In the meantime, deliver your egg to Instructor Skythorn at The Arboretum.30142Oh my! This egg is going to hatch at any second!Well, looks like this little guy is eager to meet you.Are you ready?30143Ahh, it is you again, .Instructor Windblade is looking for you. You can find her on the ridge to the east.She has some news about your cloud serpent.30144Now that your serpent is fully grown, you are ready to begin flight training.As with all novices, you must start at the beginning.Your first task is simple. Fly through 6 of the cloud rings between the spires to the east.30145The next task will be a little harder.Are you ready?30146Cloud serpents love to eat, and one of their favorite treats is the sugar minnow.These fish can be found in salt or fresh water anywhere in Pandaria. I trust you have some skill in fishing, and your own fishing pole to catch them?Bring me a fresh catch and I'm sure the hungry beasts around here will be very grateful.30147The Order of the Cloud Serpent's history stretches back thousands of years, and although we have tried to preserve the old ways, there are ancient techniques that have been lost over time.You can help us recover some of this knowledge by searching Pandaria's dig sites for clues to our past.Use your archaeology skill to survey around Pandaria and bring me whatever you find.30148Many of the baby hatchlings at Windward Isle have been injured as a result of all the fighting.I have been told that you may be skilled in the art of first aid.Please go northeast and use some of your best bandages to save the injured hatchlings.30149I have heard that you know a thing or two about cooking.As it so happens, serpents love to eat Fish Cakes.If you use your culinary skills and bring me 5 of these dishes, the cloud serpents around here will be very happy.30150From the cloud serpent's behavior, you have a hunch that it wants a sweet treat.The fragrant trees in The Arboretum are home to many honey hives.It will be a simple matter to collect combs from the nearby honeykeepers.30151You have a feeling the serpent is tired of being cooped up all day. How about playing a little game of catch?30152The time for the great race is upon us!Traverse the course among the spires and pass through the checkered flags on each of the 10 balloon checkpoints.Make sure to pass underneath the finish line when you are done.The competition will be fierce, but I wish you luck. Speak to me when you are ready to begin.30154Uh-oh, looks like someone is in a bad mood today!Luckily, you know just the thing that will cheer up the little beast.Cloud serpents love the taste of tiger meat, but the tender flanks can be... challenging... to acquire.Luckily, you recall there are some fat, juicy tigers to the northwest, on Windward Isle.Sure, you might suffer some scratches and a little mauling, but it's all worth it for your serpent, right?30155The situation at the islands remains dire, .The Slitherscale saurok have not responded to our attempts at peace, so only one option remains.In order to protect the wild cloud serpents, we must rid the island of their presence. Only then can the cloud serpents be left to live in peace.30156Ouch! It seems, without a doubt, that the little beast is hungry. You recall that some meaty-looking turtles can be found on the wild cloud serpent island to the northeast.Perhaps some turtle meat will fill the hatchling's voracious appetite.30157Oh, thank goodness, another cloud serpent trainer!I just received word that the wild hatchlings at Windward Isle to the northeast are in serious trouble!While the adults fight those terrible saurok, who is watching the cute little babies? No one, that's who!WE HAVE TO SAVE THEM!I'm sending every trainer I can find to go and help. If you aren't too busy, can you make sure the hatchlings are safely delivered back to their mothers' nests?30158If we are to stop the poachers, we need to take more aggressive action.If we can remove the enemies' primary tools for killing and capturing serpents, we may be able to stop their operation altogether.I need you to go into their territory on the eastern end of Windward Isle and steal their weapons.A cat without claws cannot strike.30159Oh no! We must stop them! , is it? The Order needs your help!Do you know what those horrible Slitherscale saurok are doing?They have the audacity to steal cloud serpent eggs straight from the matriarch's nests!While the cloud serpents become ever rarer, those brutes are... are......they're eat their eggs for dinner!

They attacked our settlement without provocation or warning.Please, , can you aid us?Help us recover our lost possessions from these Riverblade raiders that march along the river and we will gladly reward you.30169The raiders are led by a particularly violent saurok known as Slovan. The Crane Temple usually comes to our aid when he attacks but now we find ourselves outmatched and outmaneuvered.Please, , aid us by destroying this raid leader.You can find him in his den behind the Krasari Falls.30172No, no, no, don't you worry about pickin' 'em up. I can hold these here barrels.I may not be the handsomest pandaren, or the smartest, or any fun to be around in the slightest, but I'm stronger than a mushan beast.I'mma just need you to lead the way.30174Kor should have caught up by now. He said he was going to secure the Ruins of Korja east of here and meet us to help with the mantid threat.He may need help against Groundbreaker Brojai. Could you assist him? Kang and I will follow shortly.30175The mantid! They came out of nowhere and smashed our convoy to ruin, scattering our people this way and that.Now they are preparing to hit Stoneplow.Please, , destroy some of these beasts before they get sufficient numbers to flank our home.If my cousin, Ambassador Len, is still alive and at our convoy he should be able to reward you for your help.3017730178Deep in the wilds, on the southern coast where the Krasarang River meets the sea, rests the Temple of the Red Crane, home of the great Chi-Ji and his most devout followers.They should be told of what happened here.If you're headed that way, I have a favor to ask; We often send supplies to the temple, but our last courier has not returned. Please look for signs of him as you travel - where the road forks at the Dojani River, he'd have gone south. When you reach the temple, find Koro Mistwalker.30179The... mogu. Do not trust. Poison. Get sample... sample blades. Bring to Dezco... in Thunder Cleft, west of here.30181Mushan! Would ya look at the size o' 'em. Old as the dirt they walk on probably. A fine trophy.If you are lookin' to test your mettle as a big game hunter, start with them.30182So, when I was scouting east of here I saw a collection of foxes. That's what I first learned to hunt when back on the Wandering Isle.If you want to see the challenge a young pandaren hunter faced when growing up, head east and face off against a bunch of foxes. They tend to be clever and cunning so be on your guard.30183Tigers! No matter what land I go to I hear about these big fanged beasts. And yet I haven't had a chance to hunt any of them.Let's go hunt some tigers. I'll go east, you go west. I think I saw some near Dustback Gorge. I'm sure there are tons near those mushan.30184My boy here is a talented hunter... in training. Let's show him an old 'Nessy style hunt shall we?I saw a mighty big mushan east of here with a hide dark as night. It looked like it had taken down a number of hunters in its day.If you want a big game hunt, go try an' take it on.30185Granted, tortoises are not big game but they can be mean game. They also work as the perfect bait for bigger game!Gotcher found some ol' tablets sayin' that the Torjari Pit is a sacrificin' site.

Dezco might have been right to wait and move west with a unified strength.The mogu hit us hard when we were searching the ruins west of here. They ambushed us using summoning portals and some dark magics. I haven't seen such evil sorcery used since Outland. We need a respite. Head west, kill their summoners, cut their supply line.30230Mogu are thugs. They have always been thugs.Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic.But these mogu are using arcane portals and spells. We need to stop them!$p, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw a number of their collectors and reclaimers to the west and north that were gathering these items.30240This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare.Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes.30241So much death. And more to come, if Ambassador Han's stories of the mantid are to be believed.We must help. We must do our part to save lives.Travel to Stoneplow. Warn them of the coming mantid attack.I will join you with what forces I can muster once I have laid Kor's body to rest.30242This is one of the challenges I put upon my warriors to keep them strong and fast. Let's see how you fare.Survive the ring for 60 seconds without getting pushed out or killed. Stay on your toes.30243The mantid are attacking again, and we're a bit short-handed up on the wall. In hopes that you'd help, I saved one of the more fun posts for you: the hot oil!It's a bit more violent and a bit less scandalous than it sounds.It's simple really. Get up on the wall, find one of the oil stations, and dump it on any of the mantid pouring up against the wall. It's very effective.30252I've been pushing and shoving and hammering all morning, but it's hopeless.These rocks won't budge!\"It will be a breeze,\" Grandpa said. \"Farming's like breathing!\" he said. Maybe for him, but not for me!How am I supposed to succeed at this whole FARMING thing if I can't even clear my farm for planting?Hey, wait a minute. You look like you've got some muscle on you.Would you be willing to help me out? Just until I can catch my breath.30254Okay, now we've got our seeds, it's time to plant them.First, we have to prepare the soil! You gotta till the soil and break it up to make a nice bed for our little sprouts.Till those two plots of soil over there, then plant the seeds in them.30255My grandfather used to say \"Yoonie, a cabbage is like a woman: ignore her and she'll turn rotten. Pamper her and she'll grow big and plump and you can put a ribbon on her and take her to market to show her off to your frie-\" look, he was from a different time, okay?The point is, now that our cabbages have sprouted, they need attention! Today they look a little dry, so you should water them.Here's the old watering can grandpa left. It will always be near the field if you need it.30256It's time for our hard work to pay off! Normally we'd have to wait a day before the crops are ready to harvest.Fortunately, those seeds Greenfield gave us were specially designed to grow FAST. The yield won't be worth much, but they're good for stepping new farmers through the process.Our cabbages should be ready to harvest. I'll let you do the honors, of course!30257All right friend, all of that farming was just for practice!Are you ready to try the real thing?There's a lady by the name of Gina Mudclaw who runs the Halfhill Market, which is across the street to the south.I heard she's looking to buy some vegetables. Since it's your first time meeting her, you shouldn't go empty-handed.Why don't you look around the ranch and see if there are any items hiding around?Might be that we'll find a good gift to take to our new neighbor!30258I've been thinkin' about how to get into the Tiller's good graces, .Now, the Tiller's Union accepts new farmers each year, and there are five members on the voting council.We already got Gina's vote, but we'll have to prove ourselves to the other four members of their board.Why don't you go over and say hello to Mung-Mung? He works with Mr. Mudclaw out on the Mudclaw's farm to the northwest.30259Dem virmen's back!They been biting Mr. Mudclaw's carrots. Ruining his crop. And who is gonna pay? Mung-Mung, that's who!You go get the chewed up carrots before Mr. Mudclaw sees. They all over the fields to the southwest, and down under the ground in the virmen's tunnels, too.Otherwise, Mung-Mung in big trouble.You do this for me?30260Hey , I've been thinkin' recently about expanding my farm.See that plot there that's just covered in weeds? If we can get rid of those weeds, we could use that land for planting.I heard there's a farmer by the name of Gai Lan who knows a thing or two about weed whackin'.His farm is just out west. Go talk to him and see if he'd be willing to help us.30261Get to the bottom of the wall in the fastest time possible.Speak to me when you're ready to roll.30266We have cannons set up on the top of the towers flanking the main gate. They are our best method to clear the skies when the flying mantid try to pass over the wall, like they are now.Looks like you're on, .30267I love fishing. I'd be enjoying myself much more, however, if I had my bait and my lures. They were thrown away in a... a misunderstanding with my wife, Rin.Should I let a whole day of fishing be ruined, just because of a little domestic squabble? No! All I need is bugs and feathers, after all, and this glade is filled with those two things.Care to help a fisherman out?30268Take a good look. The river nearby is swarming with these snakes. Their venom causes a condition the locals call \"the murksweats.\"Several refugees were bitten as they fled the temple and have already begun to show symptoms: nausea, vomiting, and intense sweating as the body rejects all fluids, causing dehydration and potentially death.We are administering anti-venom as quickly as possible, but we'll need more venom glands. Don't bother removing the glands yourself - just bring back the whole head.30269As we say at the temple: \"Never fight a tiger with a hozen on your back.\"We will deal with the sha, but first we must see to the more immediate... nuisance.Groups of refugees from the temple are heading for a camp to the north, but they're being ambushed by saurok. Help me see the next group to the camp and we'll figure out our next move from there.30270\"A hooded falcon catches no quarry.\"This is one of the first mantras we teach young monks at the temple. It means that even a foe as swift and lethal as a falcon can be neutralized by depriving its senses.The saurok have scouts all over the region acting as eyes for their raiding parties.It's time we put their eyes out, don't you think?30271The sha have the mysterious ability to evoke powerful, often overwhelming, emotional responses in their victims.As we fled the temple, senior members of the Crane Wing order stayed behind to cover our escape. They are no doubt being subjected to intense emotional trauma, and I fear they are not all strong enough to resist falling into despair.$p, we have to show them there is still hope! Show them that despair CAN be defeated!30272Now as for that \"striking the rain\" part... well, sometimes you have to.\"Hope is the sun behind a stormy sky - ever in the heart, but veiled to the eye.\"There seems to be no end to the sha pouring out of the temple. But in order to see beyond the veil of despair, you must carve through it.With any luck, you'll find a sun behind the clouds...30273\"Broken are the bodies wherein hopeless hearts reside - the blight of despair strikes forth from inside.\"This was the last piece of wisdom the Red Crane imparted to me, just hours before the Sha outbreak.  It makes sense now...$p, when the Sha attacked, they broke forth from the temple's basement...All of his teachings - the very Way of the Crane itself... it's all been preparation for facing the Sha of Despair.The Red Crane has been expecting this conflict for centuries!30274An Alliance member? Here? Elune be praised.My team has encountered a snag. We opened a portal to this land using some ancient scrolls we had found that predated Azshara's rule.Unfortunately, the coordinates provided on the tablets were warded and the portal that meant to take us to our destination landed us in this oubliette.We have been trapped here for days, and it is slowly leaching our energies to power itself.Can you find the nearby shackles that bind the oubliette and disable them?30275How could this crocolisk have grown so large?Certainly, rumors exist of very old crocolisks that have grown to enormous sizes... but this female can't be more than a dozen years old.Perhaps someone in New Cifera can shed some light on the subject.30277An ancient mogu artifact has been uncovered in the Guo-Lai Vault, beyond the Hall of Statues. We've made repeated attempts to retrieve it, but none have been successful.We cannot let this artifact fall into the hands of the Shao-Tien. I need someone capable to retrieve it, and quickly.Are you in?30280Roars have been echoing out from inside the Guo-Lai Halls. The mogu have awakened some ancient beast, and it will not be long before they attempt to release it upon my men.Find your way to the Hall of the Serpent and slay the beast before it can be unleashed upon us. I would trust no other with such a dangerous and important task.30306We have some fresh trainees that are far from being a danger to you, but in numbers, they may prove enough of a challenge. And if not, they could use the lesson in humility.Step into the battle ring when you're ready. Don't go easy on them.30317How'd you like to make yourself useful?The season's been awful dry lately. I need someone to water the crops out in the Heartland. Here's the thing: I need you to water ALL of the crops.I keep a few kites with Wing Nga, the flightmaster across the way. Grab one of those kites, then throw water on any areas that look dry and dusty.30318Say, you there! , was it? I've got a problem, and I need someone with better legs than mine to help me solve it.My prize-winning chicken has flown the coop! Now she's out in the open, mingling with the other hens, wild birds, and...  ill-intentioned roosters.My farm is west of here, south of the Skyrange. Could you find her, and bring her back to me?30319One of my farmhands, Wika-Wika, has been tilling the soil in my westernmost field. I understand he's had some problems with pests.He's got plenty of pesticide to spray the bugs that eat my crops, but I'm afraid he has no way to deal with the marmots.Would you lend him a hand? With rampant hozen and virmen attacks, I can't afford to lose crops to simple pests.30321Ssshhay... d'you know that guy over on the farm, with the... the *hic*... the weed problem? Gai Lan, I think his name was. I love that guy, man.Anywayshh, he said that if I *hic* sent an adventurer over to go pick his weeds, he'd get me some ale.It's jusht a few weeds, not too many, probably.*hic*30322I love working in the market, although there's one aspect of this job I really dislike: collecting debts.While most pandaren debts are simply due to laziness, there are a few unsavory characters around town who simply don't want to pay, and there's some who are just too poor.A few people here in town owe me money. Could you go talk to them, and remind them about what they owe?30323A few weeks ago, a group of those jumpy little Springtail virmen broke into my lockbox and stole several handfuls of my jewelry. I've since found a few pieces, but they still have most of my collection.If you're headed up to the Springtail Crag, in the cliffs to the north, you should keep an eye out for them. I'd love to get my jewelry back.30324Not all hozen are the same. Chee-Chee's tribe was forest hozen... came from Jade Forest. Pretty easy to get along with.The Kunzen invaders... they come from mountains, far to the north. Not nearly as nice as Chee-Chee.They come into our green land, take our things, leave big mess behind.Chee-Chee wants to kill them. You like to help?30325I've been watching those Kunzen hozen, and I've noticed a consistent pattern. Whenever they're getting ready to attack, they participate in strange, barbaric rituals around their totem.If we can disrupt this ritual, not only will we put off any impending attacks, we can deal a huge blow to their morale! So get in there, rough them up, and make as much of a mess as possible!30326I've heard people talk about the hozen like they're just some tribe of barely-functional idiots... but that's not true! They have brains, too - they just don't all like to use them that much.I've heard that the Kunzen tribe has two chiefs - one in charge of fighting, and one in charge of stories, lore, and history.What I wouldn't give to see what kind of stories they tell...30327I, umm... well...Oh, never mind. It was a stupid idea.It's just that, I was thinking that maybe we can stop the Kunzen hozen from attacking us without having to, you know... KILL anything. I noticed a few ropes on the side of the mountain. I think they're using them to climb down to our farms and...No, forget it. It was a silly idea anyways.30328One of my most popular recipes is the Thousand-Year Dumpling, which is filled with preserved vegetables.I normally let the vegetables ferment in a hole underneath my house, but when I looked for them this morning, they were gone!I blame those thieving virmen.Bring them back, and I'll let you help me cook!30329A certain few pandaren around here prefer their dishes unbearably spicy. Unfortunately, my access to such peppers is limited.The Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, often carry cindergut peppers. A few of those and I'll be set for a few days.Say, could you collect some for me? You might want to wear gloves if you'll be handling them directly.30330I like to bake with truffles... when I can find them. They only grow up on the Skyrange, and in very, very scarce amounts.They're a fantastic ingredient, but we can't risk over-farming them. That's why we need to replace what we've taken. Bring me a handful of adult truffles, and plant some of these spores in their place.30331Have you ever tried Mushan Tail Stew? Chances are, if you have, that it was stringy and tasteless. You see, there's a trick to making the perfect Mushan Tail Stew: you need to cook it at high elevation.I've already gathered the ingredients. Take this pot up to the Kunzen Village, up in the mountains to the west, and prepare the stew over their bonfire.30332You know what? I think I want to grill up some goatsteak today.No, not from the puny little shaghorns they keep around here. They don't have nearly enough fat on them.You think I got to this size eating no-fat-havin' goats?Now, the shaghorns up on the Skyrange, to the west... those'll do just fine.30333Like any farming community, we have the occasional virmen troubles.The most powerful Springtail virmen live high up in the cliffs to the north, and only come down when they run out of veggies to nibble on.Frankly, I've dealt with virmen before. They're nothing but a pest that must be kept in check, and there's no better way to do that than by killing their warren-mother. Easy as that.30334The hozen, up in the mountains to the west, continue to steal vegetables from my fellow farmers. Being so close to Halfhill, I very rarely suffer hozen attacks, but my friends have not been so lucky.Seems to me like they steal way more than they can eat. If you can find any intact vegetables up there in those mountains... steal them back!30335The Kunzen hozen, up in the mountains to the west, have been acting up, lighting their fires and shouting their chants. Based on what I've heard and seen around here, that means that a ravage is coming.There's not much we can do to stop the ravage, but we can at least thin their numbers before they attack.30336From what I've gathered, the Kunzen hozen have two chiefs. One is harmless - he deals with potions, medicines, and ancient fables. The other one is in charge of the Kunzen's hunters - and the only thing they've been hunting lately is our crops.The Hunter-Chief is a problem waiting to be solved. I'm sure the local farmers would be grateful if you went up there and, you know, \"took care\" of him.30337The hozen steal from us, and we keep stealing our stuff back. It has to stop sometime.Find some of our stolen supplies in their mountain camp to the west, and place these fireworks beside them. Hopefully, if they see the explosions, they'll think our supplies are defective and stop stealing altogether.It's worth a shot, right?30344I wonder if I could bother you for another task. My daughter, the good Sentinel Commander Lyalia here, refuses to let me go into the field.I have spent everyday in that oubliette staring at the ruins to our north, itching to investigate.If we are where I suspect we are those ruins could contain the key we need to finding the fabled Pools of Youth!Please, ! Go to those ruins and salvage any tablets that still have writing on them.30346Perhaps these mogu know where the pools are.Our scouts have reported seeing a commander along the southern side of the Ruins of Dojan.Kill him and take whatever information he is carrying. They should lead you to the pool.30347North! Go north to the Pools of Youth. Get some of the water but be on your guard.The mogu list this as a \"high value\" target. Kang Bramblestaff will meet you there if he has not already arrived by your side.30348Something is... off. The water feels strange.When we arrived here I felt the presence of the Light, strong and vibrant, far to the north.I thought it would be the Pools of Youth. But this... this water is tainted somehow. Stained with mogu magics.I think it best I try only a sip and we see what happens.30349While you were at the ruins dusting off tablets for my father I lost five scouts to wandering mogu patrols.These creatures apparently have little interest in peace and are about as trustworthy as the Horde.They are too numerous and we are too weak, however.Go to the ruins west of here and cull the mogu numbers. They won't be expecting a .30350The hidden master may have to wait. Look at these people, $p.They are so THIN! They must be starving.You know what we need? A big steaming bowl of Squirmy Delight.If you find yourself near a river, try rounding up some intact skitterer glands and I'll cook up a batch.30351The mogu really like their poisons and curses. Mama Bramblestaff always said lotus tea cures any mogu curse.I saw some imperial lotus plants in the nearby Ruins of Dojan. We should go gather some of their leaves and keep them on hand just in case the mogu get unruly.Also, this will give me a chance to introduce my fists to some mogu faces.30352Thing about hunting birds is you need ammo - and I ain't got any. Thing about hunting with Nesingwary is you need to prove you can keep your tally and bragging rights up.Can't hunt, can't brag. And I like bragging so this is no good.Can I hire you to go kill me some carp hunters? You'll find them up and down the river west of here. There are a bunch of them so don't hesitate to hunt while doing other stuff.30353Two words: Tiger Blood!This is gonna sell better than saronite back on the black market. Especially once I finish spreading a rumor about how it makes you all buff and stuff.And this jungle is just full of tigers. Can you round up a few vials of tiger blood for me? I'll cut you in on the scam.30354We were searching the ruins south of here when the mogu fell upon us out of nowhere.Some of us were able to retreat to this encampment but many others were captured. The mogu have also caught a number of the Horde who happened to be in the area as well.Please, $p, rescue any sentinels that you can.Leave the Dawnchasers to their fate.30355Mogu do NOT use arcane magics.They are thugs. They have always been thugs. Only when they ruled their empires in the old stories did they ever know any kind of magic.But these mogu are using arcane portals and old artifacts. We need to stop them!$p, look for any artifacts the mogu are using to cast their magics with. I saw piles of these items being collected near the Ruins of Korja south of here.30356The mogu reclaimers are using portals to connect to Kun-Lai Summit, bringing in reinforcements and supplies.What is worse, they are sending their captives through these portals.Go to the Ruins of Korja and destroy as many of these Korjan Reclaimers as you can find.30357Help me, $p. These poor pandaren are in need of healing, and my powers are weakened.I did find an old tome in my collection that allowed me to convert the herbs you collected earlier into a healing poultice.Use this on the injured pandaren and it should get them back on their feet.30359They have my daughter! Brojai... that Lord Reclaimer! I can see him clearly through Lyalia's eyes.That foolish girl must have tried to take him head on.Please, $p! Go to the Ruins of Korja and try to free her.I'll get Kang and try to draw out Brojai from the ruins with a distraction.30360My father gave me his life. Tyrande gave me her trust. My sentinels gave me their allegiance.It is time I repaid them all.With Brojai dead we can mop up the remaining mogu. The next threat is the mantid.Go north to Stoneplow and lend them your help. Tell them I will be bringing what sentinels I can muster to aid in the defense of their city against the mantid.30361The mantid! They came out of nowhere and smashed our convoy to ruin, scattering our people this way and that.Now they are preparing to hit Stoneplow.Please, , destroy some of these beasts before they get sufficient numbers to flank our home.If my cousin, Ambassador Len, is still alive and at our convoy he should be able to reward you for your help.30363Ha! So my father just wasted twenty years of our lives on a fool's errand!I'm taking charge.When Tyrande sent us here she was very specific that we not come back until we find the source of the Light that she saw in her visions. It's obvious now that the Pools of Youth were not it.I want you to look for my scout. I sent her to investigate the Crane Temple but she hasn't returned.Get her report and rendezvous with us at the Sentinel Basecamp further west.3036530366303673036830369303703037130372303733037430376The Shado-Pan are likely dealing with similar outbreaks elsewhere in Pandaria.Seek out Loon Mai, the Shado-Pan Watch Commander in Stoneplow on the western end of the Valley of the Four Winds.

I'll leave the method up to you.30467My son - can you find my son?When the Jinyu attacked, he ran off in the confusion. I don't know if they've done anything with him, or if he's still alive, even.Nothing else matters if I can't find him. I'd ask Mei... but something's wrong with her. She seems too... impulsive since the attack. I just can't trust that she'd bring him back safely.30468I don't think I've ever been as... as furious as now. What betrayal!I fought them off when they attacked, killed a few here, but Merchant Shi is too much of a coward to let me go and finish the job!You, do it for me. Kill them. Kill them all.30469Of course, the first priority is finding my son. But, if we save ourselves only to starve, then what have we accomplished, in the end?Please, I need you to recover some of the supplies that the Jinyu took from our caravan.30470That Tina Mudclaw is in the Halfhill Market today, visiting her sister. She's really nice, but she's really hard to get gifts for!There's a little jewel that can be found in the cliffs to the north. It's called a chrysoberyl, and it changes color when you hold it. I'll bet she doesn't have one of THOSE!Look inside the virmen caves. I bet you'll find one really fast.30471That crazy Chee Chee is actually pretty neat. Mah always said that hozen were nothing but trouble, but... I guess he's just a better hozen then the rest of them.We should do something nice for him! Those mountain hozen in the west make some really fancy stir fry, and keep bowls of it inside their little hozen houses.I bet Chee Chee would love some!30472Sho - that girl who lives up in the mountains - is in town today. I saw her walking toward the Halfhill Market.Such a long walk... she must be hungry! And I think I know just the thing that she'll like.The hozen up on the Skyrange cook a soup out of fish and apples. It sounds gross, I know... but it's awesome. You'll find it near their big, scary totem.30473That Fish Fellreed is kind of weird. First of all, her name's Fish. That's weird.Once you talk to her, though, she's really a nice lady. Did you know that she's an animal lover?I've got an idea! The Kunzen hozen, in the mountains to the west, make little animal statues and put them in their huts to scare off bad guys. I bet Fish would LOVE something weird like that!30474That poor Ella. She's so shy! I saw her standing in the Halfhill Market, looking really hungry, but afraid to talk to any of the chefs.We should bring her some food! And not any boring food - something special.The Kunzen hozen make spicy shrimp dumplings from ingredients they've stolen from our farms. I don't like spicy food, but Ella might!30475Farmer Fung is pretty mean, and just a little scary. Mah always said that he was one of the best farmers in the valley, though.I think I know the perfect gift for a mean, kind of scary guy like him.There's some big plainshawks that circle the hills to the west of here. You should get one, find a big piece of meat, and then ask Kol Ironpaw to grill it up!30476Old Hillpaw has about a million chickens on his farm... but that's not what he REALLY loves.I saw. He collects blue feathers.I don't realy know where to get a blue feather around here, but I do know where to find some blue pearls!Check the oysters in Cattail Lake to the northwest. I'm sure a blue pearl will look nice with his feather collection!30477Haohan Mudclaw is the big boss of the Tillers union and the richest guy in the Valley! He's been nice to let me stay here, so I want to do something nice for him.He likes expensive stuff, like ruby shards, but I don't have a lot of money, so I need to get him something else.I know! I've seen a great big fish in Cattail Lake! We should get one of its teeth as a gift!30478Sometimes I feel sad for Jogu. He's the only jinyu around, and I don't think he has any friends. Other than his smelly bottle, of course.You know what? I've got an idea. Farmer Yoon has a basket of craneberries inside his house, and a few apples as well. I'm sure you could bring them to the stillmaster in the Halfhill Market and get him to brew something special for Jogu.30479Have you seen Gina Mudclaw, the market girl? She has it all - looks, brains, and nice big tummy. Could you deliver a gift for me?I wanted to pick some orchids that grow on top of the big hills to the west, but I can't climb that high. Could you pick a few and bring them to Gina?Oh, and when you see her... tell her I said \"hi\".30480From the moment I first rose from the river, I knew I was destined to be Waterspeaker.I was taught many rituals, and have performed all of them, save one.There was one, an extremely ancient one, that we were told to call upon if our people ever turned against us. This must have happened in our people's distant past, because we haven't needed to use it in our village's memory.I suppose now is the time to do so.30484The time for war is at hand, !We've been training these natives non-stop since you left, and I believe they're as good as they're going to get.See for yourself. Check in with the others and return with your findings.We must rely on our enemy being somehow... even less prepared.30485These hozen are behaving most unnaturally, . Marching in formation? In armor?This troubles me. We must discuss it at another time, however. I have come to ask for your assistance.The ancient fresco, where last we spoke, is nearly unveiled. I am certain that it holds ancient wisdom - knowledge that the emperor wanted us to remember.My meditations alone may not be enough to discern its meaning. Please, take this heirloom to the shrine of my ancestors. I shall require their assistance.3048630487The mountain pass is very dangerous. You need much luck to survive. Nephew Bentnail will show you the way.Perhaps today is a lucky day to travel though. Wind blows from the east; this is good sign. Grummles always travel best when east wind blows.Climb in the cart when you are ready to leave.30488What the heck are you supposed to be? A ? Never heard of one of them. You here to help or to steal my yaks?Look, if yer' insistin' on helpin' out, go find my boy. He got himself grabbed by a bunch of sprites and probably doesn't even know we lost the ranch.They dragged him off to Pranksters' Hollow south east of here. Go rescue him an' I'll see about giving you a reward of some sort.30489Say, if you really are here to help, I could use me some needles off them sprites in Pranksters' Hollow.The grummles don't believe in luck they can't smell. They'll pay better for yaks that have that fresh needle scent.30490Yaungols! They come through here taking what they want and destroying whatever's left.I can't have these thugs destroy the last pieces of the Yak Wash here. It's all my boy and I have left.Head over to our old ranch and dish out some pain on them yaungols. I bet if you kill enough of them they'll think twice before attacking anything in this area.30491Look, my father is crazy. I love him, but he's crazy.These yaungol managed to completely obliterate our ranch and scattered our yaks every which way.If I know my father though, he's going to try to go head to head with the yaungol to get the yaks back.Can you help us round up some of the yaks so my father doesn't do anything stupid?Just ride them over to the Yak Wash so we can clean them up and sell them to the grummles.30492I wasn't lying about your reward. Here, take these washed yaks to the grummle caravan master Eightcoins.You can find him at the Grummle Bazaar west of here. He'll credit us and give you a delivery fee.He may be short, but he is our biggest customer.Return to me if you lose the yaks. More often than not they just come right back here anyway. Once they've been cleaned that is.30495Can I trouble you for another favor?We're way behind schedule, and this jade shipment is the last we need to finish the great statue.I've got my hands full, so could you run this ore over to the other foremen?Historian Dinh, Surveyor Sawa, and Kitemaster Shoku can all be found around the base of the statue. Taskmaster Emi is directing production at the top of the statue.We're on a deadline, so make sure you do it fast! Time's a wasting!30496There is great dissent in Inkgill, . Elder Shai Hu drank the sha-corrupted waters of the mere, and forced the others to do the same. When I protested, Orachi of the town guard confiscated my ritual staff and banished me.Now, I am not only an exile, I am unable to speak with the waters that once gave me guidance!I am not a fighter. But if you are, perhaps you can recover my staff from Orachi? He is in town to our north.30498Oh, before I forget, I have something I was asked to deliver to you. A letter from one of your companions, I assume.I was made to understand that your presence was urgently required, so I took the liberty of arranging your passage.Speak to Ginsa Arroweye just south of here when you're ready. She has a kite waiting.30499Oh, before I forget, I have something I was asked to deliver to you.

If the legends are true, it will take much more to release this land from the grasp of the Sha.The aggression of that battle awakened a host of living negative emotions. What you see here is likely the first of many such manifestations.For now, we can only try to diminish their presence here.30502The more powerful remnants of that horrible manifestation may be too much for you to handle on your own, .I fear I'd be of little help in terms of actual combat, but I can suggest a solution.The great jade statue was soon to become a living serpent - one of our revered celestials. Its construction imbued it with special powers that may sufficiently weaken these adversaries.30504Your companions have made themselves at home in our land, and brought with them a dangerous conflict.The full extent of their destruction here we cannot yet know. Already it is... unspeakable.Nevertheless, to forsake your friends out of spite would be against our way. Any that yet live are doubtlessly wounded and in desperate need of care.These fireworks were to celebrate the statue's completion. Use them near your companions to signal Mishi, and she will bear them off to safety.30506It would seem that your Admiral Taylor has awakened from his injuries.

But I think I've found a way to get the locals on our side. You just helped fight off some of these \"yaungol\", no?I hear yaungol sacked Westwind Rest, a local village. We've been told that two groups of survivors have camped out along the road west out of town.We help them out, maybe they'll consider siding with the Allliance.30513I am injured, but we can't stop here.The hozen were... unreliable. The pandaren would be much better allies.You have seen the refugees in this village, and heard of the yaungol invasion, no?Well, we've heard from the locals that Eastwind Rest, a nearby village, was destroyed by the Yaungol.Apparently some survivors have gathered along the road out of town.Go. Take the road west. Gather the survivors. We'll help them rebuild. Then, they will see the advantage of joining the Horde!30514The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive. I do not know what has prompted this change in their behavior, but we don't have time to find out, now. We fear for our lives and livelihoods as long as Ur-Bataar, leader of the Bataari yaungol, lives.Go, set the banner in his camp ablaze to challenge him, and then defeat him in battle. Only then will we be secure.30515The yaungol have always been a difficult, proud people, but never this violent or aggressive.

Only thing is, I'm running low on weed killer.I make my own concoction - very potent, totally organic and good for the earth. Plants love it! Well... except for those pesky weeds. They hate the stuff!If you bring me some Spideroot from the terraces just west of us, I'll make a fresh batch and go down to Yoon's farm myself.I would gather some myself but... well... I hate spiders. You'll see what I mean.30517The next voting member on the Tiller's council is Farmer Fung, and it's easy to see why.That man's vegetables are the biggest in the valley! I only hope that someday I can grow pumpkins as big as his.If we hope to join the Tillers, he would be the next person to convince.30518You want my vote for Farmer Yoon? Ha! You're joking, right?Listen, I'm not going to vote for some citypaw with no lick a' knowledge about farming the earth.It would be an embarrassment to farm alongside you or that Yoon shmuck.Now let me deal with my own problems. Some devil let my prize yaks loose, and now they're running wild northwest of Halfhill.If I could just get my yaks back, then maybe I'd be able to sleep at night.30519The next vote we'll need is from Nana Mudclaw. She's Haohan's grandmother, and she's been a Tiller longer than you and I have been alive!She's still working at the Tillers building in Halfhill. Why don't you pay her a visit?30521This is going to be tough, .The last vote we need comes from Haohan Mudclaw, the head of the Tillers Union.I know he wasn't too keen on us to start, but we've learned so much about farming, I'm sure he'll have a change of heart!Go speak to him. You can be very convincing, right?30522What are YOU doing here, citypaw?Look, I've got my hands full with a break-in at my shed to the west. Some rascals came in the middle of the night and ransacked the place.I've got missing seeds, broken tools, and eaten inventory to deal with.I'll just add it to my list of other troubles: a whole wagon of melons stolen, a broken water pump, animals ruining my harvest...I wish that I could just get to the bottom of all this already!30523Hey . I've been looking at that wagon every day, day in and day out, since the day I moved in. Quite an eyesore, don't you think?I heard in town that Fish Fellreed is quite handy with tools. She might be able to fix it up, and then we could turn that patch of land into a plot for farming.Why don't you talk to her and see if she'd be willing to do the job?30524Sure! I know just the wagon that you're talkin' about!I can fix it right up, but I'll need wood.There's a whole lot of it down at the bottom of the lake. If you fish it right out - haha, get it? Fish? Oh I just crack myself up sometimes.Anyway, you bring me here some 'o that wood and then I'll get right to work!30525All right, . This is our big chance!Mr. Mudclaw's farm is in big trouble. Those mountain hozen are coming down at night, wrecking his crops and eating his hard-earned harvest.We've got to get rid of them for good, and I know just how to do it.Back in the day, my grandpa showed me how to mix a wounding poison to deal with the pests on the farm.The virmen warrens to the north hold the key ingredients for my mixture.Don't look so worried, ! I'm pretty sure this is going to work.30526The starving, mangy dog whines piteously and attempts a brief wag of its tail.It looks like it could use a good meal right about now.30527All right, now I happen to know that those mountain hozen love a delicious, sweet melon.Mr. Haohan's last harvest of melons got stolen, so we're going to have to grow some of our own.Once we have our harvest, we'll use them to lure the nasty hozen's leader out of its cave!30528You ready for the final step of the plan?The leader of the Kunzen hozen is a brute by the name of Chief Yip-Yip. It's said that he is nearly impervious to pain.I've injected the melons with a toxic mixture, so don't try eating them!Once you get his attention, throw these melons onto the ground. Yip-Yip won't be able to resist a sweet striped melon.When he takes a bite, he'll be temporarily weakened, and you should find yourself an opening to attack.30529Now that we're officially members of the Tillers Union, Mr. Mudclaw said he'd be happy to help us upturn this big ole' rock in the middle of our field.Once we clear away that stone, I've got something special planned.Run down and give him a holler to let him know that we're ready.30531305323053330534Despite your best efforts, the work is starting to pile up around here.Perhaps you could ask one of your best friends if they'd like to help out at Sunsong Ranch.30535Well, first things first! I'm going to need lots of help 'round here.If we're going to be partners, you've got to learn how to harvest crops, and if you wanna harvest crops you gotta plant seeds!Now it's my understanding that a mister, uh... Grainfell? No, that wasn't it... Greedfill? That doesn't sound right...Greenfield! That's his name! He's the man to see for seeds.Greenfield's got a stall over at Halfhill Market, directly southeast of here - go see him and pick up some vegetable seeds.30536Oh, hello.

Kill the wretched beast and recover any clues to my son's whereabouts.30586Pandaren have been harvesting jagged abalone in this area for generations.  Now it's time for you to learn the ritual.The abalone can be found just northeast of here in narsong trench.  Be careful, we have noticed increased shark activity in that area recently.30587For now, the yaungol invaders seem content to steal yaks. Surveying the area, however, you notice they could easily move on the Yak Wash at any moment.Thinning their numbers may help show the yaungol that this area is protected.30588The riverblade saurok clan is attacking one of our local fishing expeditions!  They need help right away!Thin those saurok out and help that expedition return safely!30589To dislodge the alliance ship, we need to find our engineer. He parted ways with us when we were escaping the wreckage.You should be able to find him somewhere in the western forest. Tell him Korga sent you and he'll get in line to help.30590We can help you get your ship free, but we'll need more of the explosives we were trying to take back from the Alliance to make it happen.I ordered the men to grab all the explosives they could before making our escape. If you sift through the wreckage and bodies to our south, there should be some explosive bundles among them, those that didn't already blow up anyway.Get me enough of them and I think I can put something together for ya.30591The forest has become far more dangerous ever since Shen-zin Su began shaking. The tigers are agitated and have begun attacking the refugees, and on occasion, me as well.If these injured and weak survivors are to make it to safety here at the hut, we need to help clear the forest for them.30592Bad fortune for grummles today.

We can't afford to have a fight with an army of statues right now.30594I've got much to do here, . I could use your help.There's a place to the northwest. The pandaren here call it Mogujia. Something's causing the statues there to animate, and our pandaren friends here are pretty spooked about it.If they're not dealt with soon, we might have a serious problem. We just moved in. It's not like we can afford to fight a war with an army of statues right now.30595Let me guess, you're here to deal with the mogu statues that are being reanimated. What a coincidence, I'm here to, um... conduct research on the mogu.I tell you what, if you bring me as many of the mogu relics in there that you can carry, I'll give you a cut. Of the research... funding.30596While you've been destroying the reanimated mogu statues, the unmistakable accent of a Zandalari troll has been taunting you.It's clear that the threat to Westerly Rest will not end until he's been dealt with.30597This beautiful stone clearly has magical potential... at least to one trained in alchemy.  You are certain that with the right herbs native to Pandaria, this stone could become very useful.30598Great cranes have been nesting in this area for generations.  The Narsong Spires provide a sheltered area to rear their young.Their pristine eggs are revered as bait for catching the silver goby.  Retrieve a crane egg and see if you can catch a goby!30599Before, grummles keep hozen from ravaging by bribing with food.But now the Broketooth hozen south of here have their big magic idols.

We grummles make the best guides, but many have run away. They fear the mountain pass now. Many good grummles disappear up there.Grummles are good at many things, but are not very brave. Maybe with fire lotus incense you can make them brave. Then they will show you the way.30602The Broketooth hozen stole our Rabbitsfoot!

My rabbitsfoot is a big luckydo for grummles everywhere. If hozen learn how to get luck from my rabbitsfoot then all is lost.Please can you get it back?30604Hozen only ravage when they think their supplies are too few for their number of mouths.Problem is, hozen always have more mouths than food.We have very few grummles these days.It is a hard thing to ask, but can you be a friend to grummles, and destroy some of the Broketooth hozen south of here? It is the only way to prevent them from destroying the landscape.30605While you were gone, I saw a group of grummles coming down the Burlap Trail. It was led by my Brother Yakshoe.But then the Knucklethumps attacked. They took my brother and his grummles north.Please, $p! Save my brother. He always has bad fortune and no luck, but he is my brother. Look for him at the alter in front of Fort Silverback.30606The Knucklethump hozen have new chief, the Ook of Dook.He sees fear in the west, anger in the south, hatred in the north, and yaungols in the east.And so he sets his hozen to ravage, gathering food and supplies for coming famine.They are many Knucklethumps and dangerous.Please, Luckydo, can you defeat their fighters?30607The hozen have a yeti! They call it Old Poot Poot and keep it at the back of their cave.Hozen are normally scared of yeti, but now they feed it grummles.They have a Hunter Chief, Cho Cho the Wicked.

Take some grummles with you. Keep them safe and get them near supply crates.Grummles know what to do from there.Rabbitsfoot and I will meet you there.30611Your yeti ride gave me an idea. The Ook of Dook has a pet yeti he named Chomp Chomp.He uses this yeti to scare other hozen in to making him the leader hozen. We need to get rid of that yeti.Go to Dooker Dome northwest of here and defeat some of the Cagemasters so Chomp Chomp is not tied up as much.Yakshoe and I will meet you there with lots of incense and a dirty yak.30612The time has come to face the Ook of Dook. We beat him, and the hozen won't have someone telling them to ravage.Here is the plan: Yakshoe will lead Tassle in to arena and scare away Chomp Chomp.Then, you sneak in and fight the Ook of Dook while his hozen are distracted by the yeti rampaging through their home.We'll meet you back at Kota Basecamp with a big reward. Good fortune to you, friend of grummles.30613Armored Carp are a delicacy around these parts.Unfortunately we can't fish them up since they snap our hooks with their powerful jaws.

This I must know.Here, take this vial, and fill it with yaungol oil from one of their windmills. I will give you many fortunes if you bring me some.30615While you've been destroying the reanimated mogu statues, the unmistakable accent of a Zandalari troll has been taunting you.It's clear that the threat to Westerly Rest will not end until he's been dealt with.30616Yaungols are attacking our Burlap Trail. This is most bad fortune for grummles.We use that trail to carry supplies to the Serpent's Spine.

Speak to him when you arrive.30618If you're looking for the best supplies in Kun-Lai you've come to the right place! Oh sure, it looks a bit empty. Don't let appearances deceive you..Oh, who am I kidding?! Between the hozen attacks, and the sprites pillaging what few supplies we do get, my stock has dwindled to a dangerous level.If you could help me recover some of my supplies I should have enough to contribute to your journey.30619I know your friends are worried about the animating statues over at Mogujia, but I'll tell you what you should really be worried about.Where there are animated statues, there are mogu.

First, never sneak up on a sleeping yak. Second, having luck on your side is both necessary and hard to come by.The grummles believe in carrying a lucky trinket at all times. In my mind, if one trinket can sometimes bring luck, then many trinkets would guarantee it!After arriving in One Keg my lucky trinkets were stolen by those little menace sprites. I'd be truly grateful if you could retrieve them for me.30622Without the wall to protect us, we barely stand a chance. If you hadn't gathered so many people to help us, we wouldn't have a prayer.Check in with Captain Oakenshield - he should be up near the break in the wall. Kill as many mantid as you can on the way there.If we win, we win. If we lose, we go down fighting. For Pandaria!30623You see those huge mantid commanders out there? They have a strange aura about them. It reminds me of the sadness we saw at Zhu's Watch.Perhaps... they're under the influence of the sha, too?I kept Ken-Ken's mask - the one he used to remove the sha from Yi-Mo. I believe that, if we use it on the mantid, we can convince them to turn back.30624I been thinkin'.We got all this beer that Chen brewed, and we got all these people that you've gathered. We should bring the two together.There's a bunch o' folks out there in the fields, riskin' their lives for Pandaria.

Either way, I wouldn't want 'em to fight without a good brew in their belly.30625Those five students - the ones who were looking for the Hidden Master - they went up to the front lines, alone. I'd send Shado-Pan to aid them, but I haven't got any left.There's dangerous creatures up there near the wall. If you find those students, make sure that they haven't fallen to any of them.30626I'm going to withdraw what few forces I have. We may have to fall back to the Stormstout Brewery, or even Halfhill. That call is Commander Loon Mai's to make.You go ahead. Deliver word to the Commander.

It is not too hard. NOTHING IS TOO HARD.Go now, . Go, and save Stoneplow!30628One last thing, . Don't worry, it's not another favor. You've killed enough mantid today.We recently received a shipment of high-quality armor from Kun-Lai Summit. I was planning to keep them for my men... but I can't think of anybody more deserving than you. You'll find them on the second floor of the inn, here in town.30629Oh, hello.

And mine, it appears, is destined to continue for a time.A chain of events began when your people arrived here, and while some of those happenings are traumatic to behold, I feel there must be a larger purpose behind your presence.For now it is wisest that you leave this place and explore Pandaria's other regions.Speak to me when you are ready to leave.30650Look, I know the Alliance needs recruits, and there's just not enough of us here right now to make a fighting presence of this town.But I know that the yaungol over at Fire Camp Ordo, to the northwest, have taken many of my people as prisoners.

We have already lost the town.A few lucky villagers may have survived, but we are pinned down here.We do not have time to entertain strangers. If you can fight, help my men defend this tower. If not, leave, for you will not survive long here.30666Normally, my day consists of catching fish, and then eating the fish I caught, followed by sleeping. Note that I did not include \"fight with a crocolisk\" in that list of activities.You look like a handy . Can you go get rid of some of these crocolisks, so I can get back to my regular routine? The crocolisks normally keep to themselves up at Kea Krak, to the northwest.30667When the crocs started attacking, they scared a bunch of the lories out of their nests, up in that island to our northwest.I can use those lories' feathers to make some specialized lures, which will come in handy if and when I get to stop defending my brethren from these reptiles.You up for some feather hunting?30668Hmm. They don't seem to be... calming down. We're going to have to try something different.You'll need a raft. Go grab some wood planks and seaweed, and bring them over to me. I'll put something together for you.30669Your raft is down in the water below. Take it out to the middle of the lake, where you should find a woman. Her name is Ana  Wu.Whenever I have a question that I can't figure out on my own, I'll ask her. She should be able to tell us why these crocolisks won't stop attacking.30670Our true enemies are the sha, not the yungol.The sha are emotion manifest. Destructive, yes. But undisciplined. Undisciplined force cannot last. The flood, in dispersion, loses its force. The wildfire burns its fuel.And, discipline and wisdom can turn their destructive energy against themselves.Bring me the essences of the sha in the village, and I will explain further.30671Crocolisks attacking? I know a story about that. And I will share it with you, but first... I grow hungry.Shark meat should do the trick. You should find enough sharks in the water beneath us.30672The story did not end happily. The Narsong crocolisk is no more.This time, however, you may have a chance to change the ending.The hozen to the south are overfishing these waters. With the fish gone, the crocolisks are hungry and desperate - and so they attack Marista.Go now, ! Stop those hozen from their reckless fishing!30673Thank the heavenly spirits for you, !

There may still be time to throw them back into the water.30675The map you hold is crinkled, dirty, and poorly drawn, but you can see a big X on a beach.Is there buried treasure somewhere on this island?3067730678Turns out these rays are not as easy to catch as I thought!  You seem like a pretty smart guy, think you can help me out?I made the bombs but have been having trouble using the raft with my hurt leg.  The rays are common in the shallows just west of here.

Then we can go to Shado-Pan Fallback. The master there will know what to do!30683Did you have to throw our supplies at them?! Why not use your weapon? Maybe fancy spells or kicks? Why the supplies?!Now we don't have enough to last us, especially with Nephew Bentnail here. His appetite is like a yeti's!You threw it, you get us more. There is wreckage down the path. Maybe you will find supplies there.30684I'm sure your pandaren friend has some ideas about what the mogu are after.He headed up the mountain a few days ago without a guide, and asked that only you be sent up after him. He was very specific:\"The  must endure the trek alone, with only  thoughts.  will honor each shrine before meeting me at the top.\"The path is just northwest of the camp, marked by flags. Please be careful! Seeker's Folly is a dangerous trek even on a lucky day.30690Simply killing Kobai will accomplish nothing, as he is possessed by a particularly powerful and destructive Sha - Malevolent Fury.You will use the trap I have fashioned from the Blinding Rage Essences you brought. Lure him into the trap, and then steal his mask. Once you put it on, Malevolent Fury will appear and attempt to take control of you.Defeat him, and we will have made a victory of this tragic situation. You can find him to the north of the retreat, where he taunts us in insane rage.30691While you are in the water below, you should slay Nahassa, the mortbreath patriarch. He suffers. I can feel his death cries ululating up to the surface of the lagoon.Find his cave, and put him out of his misery. Not because it will solve Marista's crocolisk problem. Simply out of mercy.30692This here's hozen lands. Very dangerous. But grummles must trek through. Supplies must reach the Serpent's Spine.Go, protect the next wave of grummles on their trek to Kota Basecamp.If at least one survives, good fortune will find its way to you.30694My students tell me the surrounding area is littered with deadly traps, no doubt set by the saurok. Stumbling into one gets you a face full of spikes.As the saying goes: \"The Way is rife with danger - tread lightly, and with scrutiny.\"Here, this is scrutiny.It should be long enough to set the traps off at a safe distance.30695Huge maws of despair are spewing out sha from the pagodas on either side of the temple. Meanwhile, your impromptu training in the Way continues.\"She who mends torn umbrella will be more dry than she who strikes at rain.\"While I take issue with that particular lesson--sometimes punching the rain can be quite effective--the meaning holds true in this case.Take out those maws of despair and give my order a chance at reclaiming the temple grounds.30698YOU!  You're just who I have been looking for!I need more parts for my goblin fishing bombs but I hurt my leg and can't collect them myself.You see those shipwrecks nearby?  I bet they have just what I need if you can get to it and fish it out.  Take my fishing raft and see what you can find!  My buddy has been trying to help me out too so you might find some extra rafts near the wreckage, feel free to use em' too.30699The battle against the Sha is eternal - we can not leave this place. But I am troubled by the absence of reinforcements from the Monastery given that we sent for them days ago. You have performed admirably, perhaps you could travel to Winter's Blossom, our base camp on the way to the Shado-Pan Monastery. Speak with Lin Silentstrike once you arrive - he should know what is happening. To get there, travel north of the village and follow the road through Shado-Li Basin to Winter's Blossom.30700A giant, poisonous crab is wrecking havoc on our local abalone stores.

I will not be cowed so.We will do just that. Slay their forward scouts. Perhaps we can provoke - and then defeat - their leader.30714And, now they fear you.Their leaders, a Blademaster and a Mage, lie deeper in the ruins. Kill them.Make them hurt. For us.30715When we regrouped after their initial attack, we numbered three less. You can fight, and we must plan our defense should these cursed yaungol attack again. If you would help us, grant our fallen comrades their last rites, and recover their armor. You will find their bodies to the west, near the gate.And try to keep the birds off them.30716Chi-Ji is always with us. Even when he is not here in the Cradle, pieces of his spirit run through the forests and beaches of the island, watching us and testing us.Prove your dexterity in the eyes of Chi-Ji, .

Even the very feathers they leave behind are a gift for us to appreciate.We use these feathers to adorn our garments and to fletch arrows. But first... they must be gathered.30718Our order prides itself on excellence in combat.

They've gathered at the battlefield to the west.30724They are attacking again!Archers... on the wall!I need you to get up there. My wife Suna went to scout the wall with that fool Lao-Chen. Perhaps if he had spent more time preparing defenses and less building that ridiculous ale lift contraption...It matters not. Get a kite from Len, to the west, and then get up there and find my wife. She'll know what to do next.30725We regularly organize one-on-one duels with trainees that we think are well-suited for one another. We have found one such trainee for you, .Her name is Ellia Ravenmane. This will be her first duel, too. She will be waiting for you at the pavilion just to the south of here.30726Your next challenger is another relatively new trainee. His name is Minh Do-Tan, and he has won his last two matches.He will be waiting for you near the crane statue to the south.30727Ellia Ravenmane requested a rematch with you. She seems to identify you as her \"rival\".We discourage rivalries here within the Cradle of Chi-Ji, but we rarely decline a rematch request. You will find Ellia near the Pedestal of Hope, on the island's eastern side.30728You have been matched with a... special trainee. His name is Fat Long-Fat.Fat Long-Fat... operates outside of the normal rules of combat. He does not fight every day, and when he does, he chooses his competitor. Today, for some reason... he has selected you.You will find him atop Angkhal Pavilion.30729We welcome all kinds here within the Cradle, as long as they recognize and subscribe to the ideologies of the Red Crane. One of our new, more exotic trainees comes from the human kingdoms to the northeast. She goes by the rather foreign-sounding name of Julia Bates.She is your next challenger. You will find her on the island's western shore.30730Jinyu normally avoid our order, but every few years, we find one that subscribes to the way of the Crane. One such jinyu is Dextrous Izissha.Izissha is your next challenger. He waits for you on the island's southwestern shore.30731Most of the duels within the Cradle take place between two trainees. Rarely, when a trainee exhibits a rare amount of skill, they will have an opportunity to duel their trainer.Today, you duel against Kuo-Na. She will be waiting for you at the Pedestal of Hope.30732Your \"rival\" has appeared again. Ellia Ravenmane has been avoiding her duties on the island, instead focusing on personal training, with the intent to defeat you in battle.\"I will destroy ,\" she said.I have honored her request for a rematch, but I will be keeping a close eye on her. Her motives may be shifting in a dangerous direction.30733You are making a name for yourself, . I received a challenge from one of our more skilled competitors. He believes you are not as strong as you seem.His name is Tukka-Tuk, the hozen. If you've ever fought against hozen before, you know that their apparent juvenility belies their battle acumen. Good luck.30734Usually our trainees are adventurers like yourself, or monks from Tian Monastery, or occasionally retired Shado-Pan. Very rarely, though, we will greet trainees that have no fighting experience whatsoever.Huck Wheelbarrow is one such trainee. He has requested a duel with you. Look for him on the island's western shore.30735Our highest-ranked trainee is an outsider like you. It is both strange and exciting to live in a time when so many foreigners have embraced the way of the Crane.Your challenger's name is Mindel Sunspeaker, and he awaits you within Angkhal Pavilion.30736You have already defeated Kuo-Na Quillpaw. You have not yet fought her brother, Yan.He will meet you at the Pedestal of Hope, and he will not hold back. His reputation as a trainer is at stake.30737Fat Long-Fat has requested another match with you. I find this strange. And concerning.He will be waiting atop the Dome Belrissa.30738When we last spoke, I promised to tell you the secret of Fat Long-Fat. I still plan to tell you that secret... after I determine your worth.I will meet you on the western shore, and we will duel.30739Ellia Ravenmane, your rival, has returned. She demands that you meet her atop the Pedestal of Hope.You need to understand, ... something horrible has happened to her. She has changed. You will see for yourself when you arrive at the pedestal.Good luck, .30740While you will always hold a place of honor among our order, you are still welcome to participate in our duels.One of our current champions awaits you in the Dome Balrissa. I know that they would be honored to duel with you.30742I mussed up. Bad.It's hard work cutting seeds out of kafa berries! But I noticed goots eat the berries up and give back the seeds... in a day or so.I fed everything I had to the goots on Kota Peak and now they're nuts! Chargin' everything that moves.Kota used to be safe for Grummles to gather kafa. Not anymore. Not with them goots. Will you help?30743It was genius: kafa berries go in the goot, seeds come out.Kafa'kota is already rare and worth a fortune, but my invention--Kafa'goot--is GOURMET.But its over now. Uncle is upset and peak is a muss. All thats left is to collect the rest of the Kafa'goot and never make it again.I won't ask you to gather it--kind of a mussy task, not fit for hero-- just mark it so I can find it easily when the mountain is safe again.30744Kota Peak is famous for its kafa bushes - no other can survive at this elevation.Grummles make very good living selling Kafa'kota Blend, but it's dangerous now thanks to my cousin here. He's got the wildlife up there hooked on kafa with his scheming.Kafa'kota is more scarce than ever with goots gobblin' it up and yetis hoarding it in their caves.I pay you good for any berries you bring down from Kota.Here, take a sample. Eat it. See for yourself the power of kafa.30745Lots of yetis in Kota, yup. Usually not too dangerous. Usually just eat goots.Then they ate the goots full of kafa...Now they're moody, cranky, sleep a lot but never seem rested. Typical kafa addicts.Gonna come outta those caves soon, I'm sure. Come lookin' for more kafa.Then we all in trouble.30746Eep! Please, great Kota Kon, forgive grummle. Let me go, I'll bring lots of kafa right away! Promise!30747Okayyy... well, she's not eating anybody. That's a good start.She must want more kafa, but we gotta give her somethin' to do with all the extra energy...I got it! The Burlap Trail! She can smash hozen out there all day!What do you think, pretty girl? Wanna smash hozens?!I think so. Here, feed her my emergency flask of kafa. She likes you.30750The yaungol on the wall here are providing covering fire for the ones below. I don't know what Lao-chen is thinking, but I want you to deal with these archers.The good news is, up here we've got the spirit of the Ox helping us. When they're weakened, the ox spirit will stun them and you can use it to knock 'em off the wall.You'll find the archers just out that door.30751I have an idea, and... am prepared to make a terrible sacrifice.As much as I know that we need my stout brew, to fortify our defenders for the long-term security of the Ox Gate...It is too painful to discuss details now, but please - while you are up here defending the wall, gather the barrels of oil they are using to light their arrows. We will need them.30752I simply refuse to believe the guards will not grant us entry to the monastery should we impress upon them the seriousness of the situation.Friend, go east, to the sentinel in front of the Monastery, and demand admittance. I will come with you.30753There is only one way to kill sharks where I come from, with your bare hands!I dumped a good amount of chum in the water just off the dock here, this place should be crawling with the local reef sharks in no time.  Hop on the first one you see and take it out!30754Certain fish are only attracted to bright lights.  The forest north of here is home to a local pandaren firefly called a suncrawler.You should be able to find them on the base of the tree trunks all around that area.  Bring me back a handful of them and I can use them for bait!30757Our lord, Taran Zhu, has been overcome by a sha of pure hatred. The whole monastery has been lost!, you must find a way to free him of this possession. Last I knew, he was meditating in the Grove of Falling Blossoms.30759We've lost the Shado-Pan Monastery!Initiate Kia was able to get word to me that the sha have possessed everyone inside. Most troubling, that includes our lord, Taran Zhu., will you head north up into the mountains? Enter the monastery through the Cloudstrike Dojo. Kia is still hiding inside.30763Certain fish are very difficult to catch.  The wolf piranha falls squarely into this category.Lucky for me that you showed up!  Put those fishing skills to the test and bring me back a few from the krasarang river due northwest of here.30765, the yaungol warchief, Humongous, killed Shado-Master Zhen. He has his banner.You have to kill Humongous and regain Zhen's honor! If you don't, I will.3076630767Wait, what?! How could he be so reckless? Blowing the ship free is insane! They could kill Shen-zin Su, and all of us with it. I know we don't have much time, but we need to think of another way...30768Lin...I don't care what Ban, Lao-Chin, or even Taran Zhu says. I'm moving ahead into Townlong. I may not be able to save Lin myself, but I'm not going to sit around waiting for everyone else to catch up.Once Taran Zhu opens the doors to his precious monastery, we'll save Lin. Until then, I'll scout ahead and make sure he's alright.30769Now that we have had time to assess our enemies' weaknesses, it is time for us to deal the yaungol a direct blow.Go and confront the Osul Sharphorn up the mesa to the west.Let them know that we are here, and that we are not scared of their threats.30770There is one thing that every army needs, and that is a supply line.The enemy camp to the west contains a large beast herd, which serves as the yaungol army's main source of food.Luckily for us, the yaks and mushan beasts of this region are easily scared.Sneak in, give the beasts a good slap, and watch the results.30771When the Osul tribe goes to war, they coat their spears and arrows with a highly flammable, ever-burning pitch.They use this terrible weapon to shed not only blood, but to raze the homes of their enemies.I need you to collect some of this pitch while you are in their camp.We will use it to show the yaungol that when you play with fire, you can get burned.30772Ahead of us is the main thrust of the yaungol army.Here, they prepare their vast army to attack the villages of Kun-Lai.If we strike at the Osul now, we can cut them at their very core.Remember, for every of their number that we strike down here, we save one of our own back at home.30773The yaungol's siege weapons - those ballista spearthrowers down there - are tearing apart our defenses both at Longying Oupost and in Kun-Lai Summit.Those terrible weapons must be destroyed.Take these explosives. I've covered them in the pitch that you collected.Toss them at those ballistas, and we'll give the yaungol a little taste of their own medicine.30774I must ask a most important task of you, .Somewhere among the cages in the Osul camp is my husband, Lin. He is the light of my world.Please find him and return him to me, and save as many of our fellow Shado-Pan as you can as well.You should find keys to those cages on the Osul Marauders.30775What is there to say, stranger?I fought Jung Duk and lost. I was the fool to believe he would fight fairly.Now, my own brothers turned against me, and here I am, speaking to our enemies.I know you have come for Osul blood.I only ask that you hunt down the three who betrayed me.Urang, who poisoned my drink. Ku-Tong, who bent my spear. And Battat, whose dagger slipped into my side as my victory was assured.Do this, and I can die in peace.30776THIS. IS. WAR.I will have the heads of everyone who took Lin from me. EVERYONE!We will begin with the Osul leader, Jung Duk.Take this Shado-Pan war banner and place it at the center of their camp.Jung Duk will have no choice but to face you.Show him no mercy, .30777I have bad news. When I returned, Suna was already gone.The others say that she took her things and headed down the road to the east, muttering about hunting down the source of the yaungol aggression.I cannot allow her to venture into dangerous territory alone.I've already prepared a group of soldiers to push further east.We are leaving shortly. Hop on the caravan if you wish to travel with the Shado-Pan. You can also meet us there if you wish.30778If we are to make camp here, we cannot leave all of these yaungol bodies lying to rot.Take this torch and set fire to the villagers' corpses.The incense from the torch should purify the earth and air around them as well.Even our enemies deserve to be laid to rest.30779The rotting corpses are attracting hyena scavengers.In addition to spreading diseases from feeding on the dead, the feral creatures will attack us on sight.Go and eradicate the beasts. It is unfortunate, but ultimately for the best.30780As we entered the village, I couldn't help but notice yaungol totems lying around this camp.I have a suspicion that there are dark forces at work here, and those totems may be the key to drawing them out.Could you bring me some of these totems for further inspection? I would like to study them.30781Ban has asked me to explore the village to determine what happened here.I noticed smoke rising up from the east, the west, northwest, and the south.I need someone I trust to watch my back.What do you say? Want to help me on my first scouting mission?30782The spirits of the fallen villagers have risen! I can feel the hatred emanating from the spirits., if we are to survive here, we must defend ourselves. This is the only way we can put them to rest.30783I should have suspected a sha presence earlier!We are safe as long as we stand inside the Totem of Harmony's protective wards, but many of our people were not so lucky.They were trapped outside the camp when the sha's powers manifested, and now they turn upon each other!Take one of my totems with you. Place the totem near a crazed ally to purify them, but beware.You may have to face the darkness that gripped them.30784One of our rangers reported seeing Suna up the hill to the northwest.I am relieved to find her safe. I had feared what she would do in her grief.Would you go speak to her on my behalf?Take this totem with you. If you encounter any danger along the way, you may find it useful.30785With your help, we have quelled the spirits of this place.At last, they may rest in peace.Our journey into this cursed land, I am afraid, has only begun.I have some important matters to finish up here, but we will be moving out soon.I need someone to go ahead and tell Lord Taran Zhu that we are joining him.Find him at the Gao-Ran Battlefront. Tell him what has transpired here.30786My fate is sealed. The yaungol put this spear in my side. The wound will kill me.The yaungol hold me in place with their twisted, corrupted magic. The indignity of it hurts worse than my spear-wound.My death, I cannot stop. My imprisonment... you may be able to help me with this.30787Until recently, the yaungol shaman would come here to work alongside us. Now, they bend my people to their will.If we refuse, they kill us. Even if we oblige... they kill us.The yaungol mist-shaman's magic flows through his torch. Take his torch away, and he has nothing.30788The leader of the yaungol mist-shaman is named Jahesh. He is known for his strength.One of my kind is also known for his strength. His name is Golgoss.Golgoss sleeps within the mists of the Upper Sumprushes. Help me to summon him, and he will join me in avenging our people.30789If I am to fight Jahesh, leader of the yaungol mist-shaman, I must have Arconiss by my side. Arconiss' ferocity is second to none.He rests beneath the mists of the Upper Sumprushes. Find his resting place, and then use these torches to awaken him.30790Golgoss' strength is great, but he requires nutrition before he can use it.The snarlthorn bushes in the Upper Sumprushes have heavy, fibrous branches. These should sate his appetite.30791Arconiss fights with unmatched fury, but his extended stay beneath the mists has left him weakened.The rodents of the swamp are plentiful, and their bodies are filled with nourishing blood. Return with blood enough to reignite Arconiss' spirit.30792I knew death would come. I did not know that it would come this fast.I must buy time. The mist of the Upper Sumprushes is warm and fragrant. Such mist is nutritive to my kind.Gather this mist however you can... in jars, in vials, within the interior of your bags. Bring it back to me, and I can use it to remain corporeal for a bit longer.30793Now is the time to strike.Golgoss, Arconiss, and I will go east, into Jahesh's domain. Meet us there, and prepare for battle.Today, we restore the pride of our people.30794I... am alive... but barely. They killed the rest. My friends... and family...I must return to the village... But, I do not have long, and cannot move on my own... are you a healer? I... have a healing potion in my hut... search my belongings. You can use your magic, if you have it.30795The Tongue of Ba-Shon should allow us to communicate from long distances, .If the relic works the way I think it will, I should be able to stay here and continue my meditations while you do some scouting in the Valley of Emperors.Mishi will take you to the edge of the valley so that we can test my theory. I would hate for you to be in the tombs with no way to contact me. That would be horrible!30796These spirits must have been released when the tombs were opened... Death was not final for the Mogu. Instead, death was merely a stop over on the path to a new body. Spiritbinders used a foul magic to transfer spirits from one shell to the next.Years of being trapped in the tombs has left them confused. They need to be destroyed before their confusion turns to anger or worse, they find a new shell.30797A ritual took place here, and from the looks of it wasn't successful.Among the abandoned items a book lies open. The text on the pages is foreign to you.Carrying the whole book may be difficult, but a single page might be enough. If you can get the page to Lorewalker Cho he may be able to tell you what it says.30798The Mogu have been scattered and sparse in number for many years. Their purpose in the valley makes sense now.With this many restless spirits they can build themselves an army using the guardians buried in each tomb. Combined with the Zandalari forces this would be devastating!The Tomb of Secrets houses elite warriors called the Emperor's Shield. They must not be resurrected! You'll find the tomb on the highest rise to the southwest.30799Given the artifacts you found on the altar, I would guess they were attempting to perform a Spiritbinding ritual.Most of the texts involving Spiritbinding were locked away in the Tomb of Shadows. Perhaps we will find the answers we seek there.Look for anything that might help us. You'll find the tomb on the first rise closest to the ritual altar.30800Our only hope is to find the Thunder King's remains before they do. He must be buried within the Tomb of Conquerors.Getting to his remains will not be easy, . The tomb will no doubt be defended by guardians and other unfriendly surprises intended to ward off thieves.Once inside we will need to figure out where his remains have actually been placed.30801The Thunder King was a vicious Emperor and with the Zandalari at his side he was unstoppable. His return would surely return this land to turmoil and misery.You must locate his remains and take them somewhere safe. The Tablet of Thunder should help you figure out how to access his tomb.30802We need to figure out where they are taking the Thunder King's remains. It won't be possible for them to ressurect him in the Valley of the Emperors. They would need to be somewhere remote and secure.It appears that getting out of here may also prove to be a challenge....Fight your way out and look for information concerning location of the remains.30804I am not gonna take this anymore. My wife, bless her, poured her heart and soul in to that ranch making it what it is today.Them yaungol got a leader over there being all smug and what not. I'll pay you handsomely if you knock that smug smile off his filthy, stinking, good for nothing face.30805After the mercenaries robbed us, most left.But one of them... after the others took all we had, he ran the rest of us through. For sport!Get justice for the fallen. Perhaps news of their death will raise my spirits enough to go on.You'll find them just west of here.30806Many have perished here. We will need to honor them properly, which means gathering the makings of incense of life. It doesn't just smell nice - it has restorative properties, and can even help plants grow. Maybe I can get a whiff of the ingredients to get me back on my feet.The materials can be found on creatures around here - except for the spices, which were stolen by the mercenaries who pillaged the village.30807I do not wish to dishonor my friends and leave them in unmarked graves.Yet, we have never needed to bury so many at once, and I am in no condition to gather materials.Please, visit the lakes that hug the mountains edge along the road to the south. Underneath the waterfalls there, you will find stones that have been polished to a sheen by the falling water. They will make suitable headstones.30808The yaungols stole our luckydos! Mean riders with spears took them from our caravan of brothers coming down the Burlap Trail.This is very bad fortune. If the yaungol discover the secrets of luckydos all grummles will be in big trouble.Recover our luckydos from Fire Camp Ruqin north of here and we will pay many fortunes to you.30814, you bear the marks of many a past battle.Good! We need more seasoned people like you to hold back the front.We've managed to secure a foothold here, but the yaungol are desperate to remove our presence.If you wish to prove your worth, go down the hill and show the yaungol that we will not back down.30815I have resolved to remove this spear from my side.For this, I require your assistance. Your grasping hands are stronger than mine.30816When the trolls came, they brought their mercenary... friends with them. I saw them go past us, to the fishing camp in the northwest. My cousin, a healer, lives there - can you check in with him and make sure he and his village are well?30819Thank you much, friend. After this tragedy, it is good that fortune has smiled on us and sent you.You have gotten justice for my fallen friends, and gathered the necessary materials to honor them. I will gather their bodies, prepare the materials for their funerals, and meet you at the graveyard. In the meantime, however, please return to my cousin and ask him to gather the villagers for the funeral.30820As I said, I will gather the town - we will be at the funeral. As the one who has done so much to honor our friends, we feel it is only right that you will be the one to light the Incense of Life and usher their spirits to the life beyond.30821Alright, it's time to take Kota Kon out for her \"walk.\"We brewed two fresh pots of kafa just for her and she's all fueled up!30823My cousin over at Kota Basecamp mussed up. He mussed up bad.He was too lazy to cut seeds out of kafa berries by hand, but he noticed goots eat the berries up and give back the seeds... in a day or so.He fed everything he had to the goots on Kota Peak and now they're nuts! Chargin' everything that moves.Kota used to be safe for Grummles to gather kafa. Not anymore. Not with them goots.

Typical kafa addicts.Gonna come outta those caves soon, I'm sure. Come lookin' for more kafa.Then we all in trouble.30827If my suspicions are correct, this place still reels from some lingering darkness.Whatever happened here... it could not have been the natural course of events.Even the yaungol are not so brutal as to slaughter their own kind to the point of... this.I will use the totems that you brought me to perform a cleansing ritual.I need someone to assist me in the ceremony. Let me know when you are ready.30828Pools of the same murky substance that came out of Mei emerged in the lake recently.I will travel into the Mere with you. Point out the pools of corruption that you are ready for me to cleanse.You will need to deal with whatever comes out and protect me as I complete the ritual.30829Thank you for coming, $p. I am sorry to have been so cryptic, but I could not risk alerting the mogu to my work here.They are seeking something in the valley. Plundering the tombs of their old kings for relics of power.I could not observe them long before having to flee, but I did manage to recover a relic of my own.The Tongue of Ba-Shon will let us communicate securely over long distances, but only after I have bound it to myself.I think I'm ready to begin, if you are.30834They survived? My father is alive!I thought we would all die here in this horrible mere, at the hands of these insane Jinyu.I will find my way back - meet me back at camp.3085430855I can hear the voice of the Mere - it has been purified.But, this chapter in my people's history will never be closed - not until we defeat Shai Hu.He has retreated to the central island in the Mere, corrupting our holiest of sites.Beware - he is strong. But, after all we have done, I am confident we will be stronger.30879Welcome, Challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes.Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round.Fight with strength, fight with honor.30880Welcome, challenger, to my tournament of champions! Today we test the strengths of Pandaria's most dedicated heroes.Your first opponent awaits you under the eastern gazebo. Defeat her, and you may proceed to the next round.Fight with strength, fight with honor.30881You may know your next challengers. They were arguing fiercely when they arrived, so I have charged them with fighting side by side.This will teach them the strength of friendship, and possibly entertain me in the process.Go to the north eastern arena and face this jinyu and hozen.Do not be gentle, they need to learn to work together.30882Your next challenger is a Bramblestaff. Strength is in their blood. I remember a full century of only Bramblestaff champions.No pressure, little .Go to the eastern arena north of here and face this young challenger. See first hand if strength is earned or inherited.30883Your next challenger is a favorite of mine. He draws strength from raw force and determination.Plus he has a mask.Face him in the western arena when you are ready, and good luck.30884This battlefront has been undermanned and unsupplied for too long during my absence in Kun-Lai. We need to get things back in order here before we can pick up the trail of the Sha of Hatred.Taoshi is my best. I've sent her north to investigate rumors of mantid that have somehow made it through the battlefront. I need someone I can trust to get out there and work with her to plug any holes in our defenses.If my reports on you are correct, I can trust you with this, right ?30885Your next challenger found his strength on a beach. Particularly in a box labeled \"dynamite.\"He proves however that found strength can be as deadly as personal strength.When you are ready, face this Master Boom Boom in the Western Arena.30887Those are mantid scouts down there. Gao-Ran's Battlefront is meant to keep them out of eastern Townlong Steppes. If we allow them north of the barricade, we may lose our foothold here.Let's clear them out. I'll be with you.30888Normally, it only takes a few scouts to hold this pass. Most of this territory is in sight of the wall, so archers would devastate any mantid force attempting to push through here. The problem is, most of the archers are occupied with the onslaught at the gate.Take this flare - it will help you locate the mantid that are sneaking through the eastern pass under our diminished watch. Kill any you find. We can't let them lay a trail that might lead the mantid swarms farther into the steppes.30889Good to meet you, . We have traps all along the pass to help us catch mantid that might be sneaking through, but their numbers have been so great that most of the traps have already been triggered.Taoshi said you might be able to reset some of them while you're out there. Can you help?30890I'm being told that our scouts have been on duty in Shallowstep Pass for more than 2 days straight, no rest. No wonder mantid are slipping through. Even the most dedicated scouts would slip with those kinds of shifts.I want you to go out there and deliver orders to the scouts that they are to return to the battlefront immediately for rest and rations. I'll arrange for a new shift to be posted.30891A new face! Pleasure to meet you. I'm Septi. I keep the Shado-Pan fighting.The mantid have poison that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for a slow, excruciating death when not treated.I need pollen from the violet citron flowers. The nearest place to find them is around Dampsoil Burrow just north of the battlefront. If you happen to go in that direction, could you bring some back for me?30892, I could use your help. With their long shifts, our warriors down at the southern front of the battlefront are fighting to the point of exhaustion, and many of them have been exposed to the mantid poison.We need more people to tend to the wounded. I've prepared some bandages with the herbs you brought me, but if you have some healing skills, those might work even better.Please, , get our men back on their feet so that they can get back here to safety.30893Gao-ran's men need help down on the southern front. If you want to stand by the Shado-Pan, that's where you should do it.30894I do have another task for you, , though it's a might grim. I really need to get to the bottom of this mantid poison, but to do that, I need more information directly from the source.While you're down on the southern battlefield, could you bring me back some mantid limbs so that I can examine their intact poison glands.30895I've got another job for you.The dragon cannons we depend on to keep the thicker swathes of mantid back are running low on ammo. The camp's cannoneers developed an improvised explosive that's made from the globe seeds down the western ridge.They dispatched a couple initiates to bring some back hours ago, but have heard nothing from them. I want to send someone a bit more capable to make sure that this gets taken care of.Are you my  for this?30896I can't catch the little buggers for the life of me.Kill any you can get your hands on. And keep a close eye on your valuables, they like to steal anything that isn't tied down.30897Look... um... this is really embarrassing. I set down my sword for like ONE SECOND to gather some orbs, and a big sprite sprung out of nowhere, snatched it, and bounded off down the western gap.I can't go back to camp without it. Losing your weapon is a sure way to get kicked out of the Shado-Pan. It's sacred.Please, can you try to find this big sprite and get my sword back? It would mean a lot to me.30898The mantid numbers have been increasing since you left for the cleft. Let's put these orbs you gathered to use.Get down on the battlefront and man one of the cannons. Let none through.30899, take these crossbow bolts and then bring them to Hawkmaster Nurong at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest.Nurong is praised among all the Wukao for being a flawless shot. His efforts are credited with holding the line here for these many months. I'm hoping you can work with him and judge for yourself. He may be the final Shado-Pan we need for the hunt.30900That thing is huge!The Shado-Pan holding the battlefront were never trained for something like this... let's get down there and take it out ourselves.30901I'm heading westward with Taoshi to gather the strongest I can find to confront the Sha of Hatred.I would like you to come with me.30902Well done, challenger. You have reached the final round.Your last opponent is a powerful master of the winds. He has defended his people for many years and stood as champion on more than one occasion.Face this Master Windfur in the main arena when you are ready.And challenger... good luck.30907And now the final round. I have selected three challengers for you to face. This may seem unfair... to a weakling. You are not a weakling, correct?Go to the main temple, stand in the grand arena, and face these three challengers. Prove you are stronger than their combined power!Good luck, Challenger!30910Please help!We paid some adventurers to run off all the elemental spirits and now they're back for revenge!30918I am ashamed to ask, but for Greenstone's sake... might we now trouble you to face Vengeful Hui on our behalf...?30921. You may be of assistance.The Shado-Pan wishes to know why the mantid are attacking so violently. We have our suspicions, but we cannot be sure. Furthermore, we do not want the mantid to know that we are investigating them.That's where you come in.I need you to kill the mantid of Kri'vess, in the north. I will lurk behind you in the shadows, and search for clues on their bodies.30922The Shado-Pan are rare, elite, and quite expensive to train and replace. We can't afford to have any falling to a poisoned weapon or an infected cut. That's why I need you to get... something.Let me be blunt. Mushan urine is a great, natural antiseptic. They produce a large amount of it, which is lucky... because we tend to use a lot.30923Every day, the mantid build up munitions for use on their enemies. We cannot stop them, just you and I... but we can set them back.I need to keep a low profile. Would you do the honors?30924Niuzao, the Black Ox, rests in the temple to the west. He may know why the mantid are attacking.He may, in fact, know much more than that.I will rendezvous with you at Niuzao Temple, .30925Niuzao owns a statuette which he values greatly: a small icon, in his image, sculpted by one of his long-since fallen sentinels. This statuette was recently stolen by the Sra'thik mantid, and taken to their encampment to our north.Bring back this statuette. Then we will give you - and your Shado-Pan associate - the answers you seek.30926It is with a heavy heart that I confirm your suspicions. The mantid are indeed under the sway of the Sha of Fear.It was OUR sworn duty to confine that creature beneath our temple. Unfortunately, our vigil faltered, our defenses buckled, and the sha escaped. It is with the mantid now.See for yourself. The mantid burrowed into the western side of our island.30927I overheard. Our secret is out, then.When I learned that the mantid had burrowed beneath our temple, I reacted hastily. I sent dozens of guardians to defend what they could, but they were not prepared. They succumbed to fear, and never returned.A pandaren deserves to die embracing the ground, as he does in sleep... not flat on his back with his eyes transfixed in terror. Please, . Give them the peace they deserve.30928You now know Niuzao's secret. We are not only the wardens of this temple... we were the wardens of the Sha of Fear that was buried beneath it.The Sha itself may have escaped... but it left traces behind. If you're truly going down into the catacombs, you should eliminate those traces, before they escape and cause greater problems than those we already face.30929Is this the place where they replace defective yaks?Can anybody help me out, here?30930I can't find a single good yak here. ALL the yaks are bad!Some are too stinky, some too fight-y, others just scared.You look like a lucky . Here, take a lasso. See if you can find a good yak for me.30931I came here to visit my dad at the temple. As soon as I got here, I saw the most terrifying thing I've ever seen.It was a mantid, walking right past me, carrying my father's crossbow.Something's happened to my dad! We've got to find out what it is... but first, we'll need his crossbow back. I saw him heading west, behind the temple.30932Yes, the boy's father - Sentinel Ku-Yao - has gone missing. He could be any number of places... we have no shortage of enemies these days.You're free to look around, if you wish. You might start by looking for his yak, or by asking Sentinel Yalo what he knows.30933I've searched everywhere... but I haven't found my father. I KNOW he's alive still. He just needs his crossbow... then he'll be OK.I've heard that you Shado-Pan guys sometimes fight the mantid on Sra'vess. I don't have any way of getting there. If you ever go over there, can you look for my dad?30935The villagers of Zouchin know the coast better than anyone in Kun-Lai. If the Zandalari are hiding on one of the islands, they will know.Mishi will take you as far as Emperor's Path. I will go ahead to speak with the village elders.Follow the path to Whispercloud Rise. Shin Whispercloud will help you reach the village.30942Shhh! Don't speak so loudly! My father might hear you.My father is delusional! He thinks I should be studying my tea pouring while our village is under attack. It's ridiculous! I have just as much courage as any man. I just don't know how to fight... yet.That's where you come in. Let me travel with you! I'm a fast learner and I won't get in the way I promise!Pleaseeeeee!If we get separated I'll meet you back in the village.30943I've seen the numbers these invaders have brought with them, this will not be an easy victory. I do know of one thing that may help us gain an advantage.There is a plant that grows around the village that can be used to make a rather effective explosive liquid. If you can gather enough I can begin brewing the mixture.The plant you are looking for is appropriately named volatile bloom. Handle it with care, .30944The villagers have been guarding Zouchin since the first attack. They are exhausted and many are injured.If the Zandalari attack again the last thing we need is for the defenders to fall asleep on the job.Relieve them of their posts so that they might have time to heal and see their families.You'll find them stationed around the village.30945The elders want us to mount a defense? We're not monks, ; we need weapons if we hope to fight!Scavenge some arms from those barbarians for me. I should be able to melt them down and make something more suitable for our villagers to fight with.Bring me as many as you can carry and I'll take care of the rest.30946The prisoner is being kept upstairs, . It will be difficult to get information from him, but even the slightest detail about their location will help.The elders have begun questioning him already. With their help we should be able to figure out our next move.Go speak with him and see if he has any useful information.30952The mantid continue to attack us. Their numbers ebb and flow, but they do not stop.It is no matter. The yak is stamina embodied. We will not bend to them.  We will defend his home forever.Will you help us?30953Our sentinels can fight for days on end, but even they have their limits. Since the mantid swarm began, too many of them have pushed themselves beyond their abilities.Please, aid them in whatever way you can. If you are unable to heal them yourself, you may give them some of this. A mouthful of nutritious yak's milk will give them the strength they need.30954This is no time to hold to tradition. Our masons' calloused hands bleed and tremble. Our blacksmiths cannot forge weapons as quickly as our sentinels can break them.It is time to fight smart.Many of the mantid come bearing weapons, and when they die, they simply leave them on the battlefield. It would be a shame to see them go to waste.30955Our patron Niuzao is a mountain on wheels... very difficult to move, even more difficult to stop. My point: once we get him moving, the mantid will have their arms full trying to slow him down.The easiest way to get him moving is to put food in front of him. Luckily for us, food in our temple is plentiful... even in wartime.I will send one of my strongarms with you, to shoulder the load.30956Today's mantid swarm is among the worst I've seen. We are lucky to have Niuzao join us in battle.Help him, . Return to the courtyard, and join in the defense of our temple.30957I command the sentinels of Niuzao. Every defender out there can hold his own against the mantid swarm.The kunchong, however, are something different.They are massive, violent, and without a question the biggest threat to my sentinels' lives. Only Niuzao stands a chance against them. Niuzao... and perhaps you.30958Niuzao's appearance on the battlefield is a blessing... in more ways than one.With the distraction that he's caused, our stonemasons have seized the opportunity to build up our crumbling walls. They could use your help.Toss any loose bricks you find up their way. And hurry! Niuzao will not rampage forever.30959The mantid now surround the Temple with their infernal war wagons. The sooner we are rid of those things, the better. You could destroy them with your own weapons and spells, but this will work much faster.Beware of retaliation from mantid that remain be inside the war wagon when it explodes. In fact, I'd stay as far away from those things as possible.30960I still have some cleanup to do here in the pass - there are some mantid still making it through. You're a valuable person to have at hand though, and I know Taran wouldn't appreciate me keeping you longer for such basic work.Taran should still be in the main camp with Gao-Ran. Report back in. I'll catch up with you a bit later.30963The Shado-Pan fight. As such, their armor often gets cut, scratched, torn, and burned. And it's my job to repair it.I'm no armorer, but I can repair a broken piece of mail as long as the hole's not too big.I prefer to use shell fragments from the tortoises that live in the wild fields to the northeast. Get some for me, and I can keep more Shado-Pan armored and alive.30964A dry bandage doesn't do much good, other than maybe keeping bugs out of the wound. In some camps, that's the best you can hope for.Not in my camp, though.I prefer to make a paste from whatever soothing herbs I can find, and layer that between bandages. The most soothing herbs I've been able to find in the field are the Mao-Willows from the fields in the northeast. If you run into any, bring them back.30967Not all of my fellow villagers from Inkgill are corrupted. Many heeded my warnings and did not drink of the sha-tainted waters.They are in hiding, terrified, and intimidated by the guards.Please, tell them there is hope! Go into the village to the north. Speak with them and send them to me.30968The end of our hunt is upon us. We have gathered the strongest the Shado-Pan have to offer, and with your strength to aid us, we will defeat the Sha of Hatred and choke out its influence on the world.When we enter the tunnel, stay close, and keep hatred clear from your heart. The fight ahead will put all of us to the test.Whatever happens, it has been an honor traveling beside you, .30969The power of these Dark Shaman has attracted many allies, . Former members of the Horde that now work towards some dark purpose.We need to make an example of them before we have another twilight's hammer on our hands.Kill any cultist you come across and bring me their insignia.30970These scorpions are infected with sha. It seems to have driven them out of their hole and into our camp, seething with hatred at invaders in their territory.We need to clear the scorpions and secure the camp. Kill any you find.30971I was dispatched back to camp to gather pitch-tipped arrows for our archers at the bridge, and this is what I came to. I trained with most of these pandaren... I wasn't prepared for this.Still, the archers at the bridge need our help. If you could help gather arrows from the wreckage, then maybe we can salvage something from this horror.30972Lao-Chin's archers will need these arrows down at the bridge. Can you bring them?30973The mantid coming across the bridge have thick carapaces that shrug off most of our attacks. They have a weakness though: fire.Lao-Chen's men brought kegs to the battlefield for exactly this purpose.  Kick the kegs into groups of mantid, and Lao-Chin's archers will light them up.They should be easy to finish off from there.30974The kegs are full of my worst stock. Good for burning, crap for drinking.I've broken out some tankards of my best spirits and had them carried out amongst the kegs though - those are for my well-deserving men!  Spirits to raise their spirits after endless, grueling fighting.Would you be up for spreading the good cheer?30975Let's press these insects back across the bridge and break their spirits!Follow my lead.30976We are one stronger. Your help is invaluable.Let's move on westward to Rensai's Watchpost to find the last member for our party.30977All of my men are down at Farwatch Overlook to the southwest, holding off mantid that are trying to fly across the chasm. As long as my marksmen have arrows, they'll ground any mantid that clear the chasm.If you're here to help, I could use some more men clearing the mantid out once they're on the ground. Are you willing, ?30978We're about to get hit hard... Pick up that cannon there and lend a hand, if you would.  There will be no shortage of targets.30979Let's get down there and finish that big bug off, you and I.30980You said that Taran Zhu is in Townlong and was asking for me?  Must be something important...30981Taoshi is setting up an ambush for one of the mantid leaders on the south side of Sik'vess. She is tasked with retrieving his crystal so that we can use it to open the door.Two are stronger than one. I want you there to make sure it goes smoothly.30982The chasm is overrun with flame hounds and lava worms, and they will be entrenched indefinitely with such a large supply of trogg flesh for food.This infestation needs to be taken care of now, before they endanger the city. You look like you can handle yourself, .I want you to clear a path through the beasts and make certain to take out the largest threats, Adjules and Magnaw.30983These dark shaman have been down here for months, raising beasts and performing dark rituals.I don't know what they aim to achieve with all of this, but it's clear that they are no friend of the Horde. That's where you come in, .Fight your way through the chasm and kill Dark Shaman Koranthal and Lava Guard Gordoth.30984This was supposed to be a routine sweep, . Clean up a few troggs, make sure there is no threat to the city and then be in the tavern by midday.Instead I've a group of scouts missing, flame hounds pouring out of the chasm and Xorenth going on about \"the next twilight's hammer.\"Go in there and get my scouts back so we can figure out what is going on down here.30986Our scouting party got DESTROYED.  Help!30987We have a duty, .It is our responsibility to spread the Tushui philosophy beyond the edges of the Wandering Isle... and there is no better place to start doing that than here: Stormwind City, heart of the Alliance.Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies.30988I only recently received word that some of your kind might be coming our way. I'd be glad to call you an ally, if you're willing to join our cause.Walk with me, .30989I need to know if you can fight. There may come a time where you will be called upon for military matters, and I need to know that you can protect my kingdom.I've heard stories about pandaren fighting techniques, but I've never seen them in person.Shall we?30990Defeat the mogu crypt guardian to open the golden doors.30991When I trained as a Brewmaster, I didn't expect to use my knowledge like this...Did you know beer catches fire when lit? Well, with yaungol oil mixed in, it's downright explosive.I've mixed the oil in with these kegs. Roll them at the yaungol over by the gate, and ignite them when you get close. It'll take a few seconds for the keg to blow, but when it does...Well, let's just say I wouldn't want to be over there.Which is why I'll be over here. Mourning the loss of this brew.30992We've heard back from Suna, on the wall. Something's going on...It looks like they are preparing for their final push. It's time to finish this, friend.30993This has simply gone too far. I cannot ignore our abandonment any longer.After all that's happened here, and all you've been through in Firebough, we must travel to the monastery.Whatever they are doing in there can wait! We can take my balloon up the mountain to the Monastery. It's anchored back by the camp, to the northeast.30994Alright. Thanks to you, we have the wall under control. Good job. I'll stay up here for a little while and make sure no more yaungol get up onto the wall.You, though, should go back down and see what Lao-Chin has cooked up. I hate to say it, but maybe he had a good idea after all...30995I sent recon out over an hour ago and none of them have reported back. And now these damned hounds are pouring out of the chasm.I don't know what's going on down there, but I'm not going anywhere till I get my men back.I want you to head in there and find them, , preferably while they are still alive.30996These dark shaman have been down here for months, raising beasts and performing dark rituals.I don't know what they aim to achieve with all of this, but it's clear that they are no friend of the Alliance. And I need your help stopping them, . Fight your way through the chasm and kill Dark Shaman Koranthal and Lava Guard Gordoth.30997I'm glad you're here, . The horde is amassing an army and I'm not going to wait to find out why.We need to strike fast and take down some of the larger beasts they have down here.I want you to head in there and take care of Adarogg and Slagmaw before the horde can use them as weapons against us.30998The horde is using dark magic to control beasts and corrupt their brethren down here, .I intend to put a stop to it, but first I need to know what it is we're fighting against. That's where you come in.Fight through the caverns and collect the insignia that the cultists carry. With them, I can study what type of magic is at work here.30999The toughest roads often have the most to teach us, . I will no doubt learn a great deal from following the path of Shaohao.Many years ago Shaohao traveled to the highest peak in Kun-Lai to seek the guidance of the Jade Serpent. I too will travel to Seeker's Point in search of wisdom.Perhaps you would be interested in a journey such as this? If so speak with Uncle Cloverleaf. He will help you prepare.31000Shado-Pan marksmen keep a constant watch over the Dread Wastes from the top of the Serpent's Spine. They would surely welcome the aid of a skilled  such as yourself.Take a kite and check in with Bowmistress Li.31001It's bad enough trying to hold off the mantid, but now we've got spiders swarming up from the ruins below.One of my best marksmen caught a blast of webbing around his leg and got pulled straight down!We think he's alive, but I don't have the manpower to send anyone in after him. We're stretched thin up here, .If you want to help, use the rope behind me to drop down into the ruins. You're not afraid of heights are you?How about spiders?31002We're holding, but just barely. Anything you can do to stem the tide of dreadspinners coming up the wall would be a big help.Feel like tearing open spider eggs one at a time by hand?I didn't think so. Take one of our dragon guns and light it up down there. I wanna hear those puppies pop.31003You aren't going to believe what I saw! Two mantid fighting each other, whipping some serious magic back and forth.One of them didn't look like any mantid I've ever seen. Completely different color and dress to him, like some kind of... oracle or something. The other one was a total psycho, splashing sha energy around like it was a keg of Stormstout Special.Look, I gotta get back to my post, but those two are still fighting in the cave behind me and I have a feeling it's a big deal. Check it out?31004Take... this...Awaken... the Wind-Reaver...It is the only way... to end the swarm.31005You will forgive my current state. I have slept for many years.A Klaxxi'va should have been here to attend my Wakening with kypari sap... but you will have to do.I sense the buzzing of sapflies to the south. They gorge on the nourishing sap I need. Bring them to me.31006I must report to the Klaxxi. They would not have woken me unless the situation were dire.You have not been entirely useless. For that, I will spare your life.The council may even find a use for you.31007The imperial clutches have become an abomination! Clutch-Keepers rush the development of new swarmborn, saturating them in this vile \"sha\" energy before sending them away to the wall.The Klaxxi wish to stem the tide of swarmborn production in these dread clutches. Put the keepers to death!31008You! Filth!You work for me now!The amber blades of the Shek'zeer Bladesworn are the finest weapons in the empire.If you are not impaled upon them immediately after leaving here, bring me as many of the blades as you can carry! I want to make sure we have weapons in reserve, should we need them.31009A Klaxxi'va whispers to the tower. It carries their whisper far; to other towers, to mantid, to paragons. The whisper bounces back, and the Klaxxi hear it.This way, they see all.A tower near the palace is quiet. This will not do. It must sing for the Klaxxi.It is my job to fix the tower, but if you serve the Klaxxi, you should serve me as well. You fix the tower, and I will wait here!31010The crystal sings to the Klaxxi. They sense a paragon in the clutch, east of the tower.Clutch-keepers are trying to pollute this one. The Klaxxi will not permit this.Go and find the paragon. Place your hands on his chamber, and the Klaxxi will channel their whispers through you to break him free. Protect him if you can.31011The Zandalari have begun their attack! You must help defend the village!If we can't push them back, we will never find the Thunder King's remains!31012Here we are, ... Orgrimmar, heart of the Horde.We can be helpful beyond the edges of the Wandering Isle. There are innumerable problems out there, just waiting for us to solve them. This is what Master Shang Xi would have wanted.There's no better place to start doing that than here, with the aid of the Horde. Let's find out who their leader is. We need allies.31013I recently received word that some of your kind might be coming our way.I've recently been trying to bolster the strength of the Horde. A few pandaren might do us good.Walk with me, .31014I need to know if you can fight... that you can kill, and live. Eventually, each of you will be called upon for war, and I need to know that you can be counted on.I mentioned a gift earlier. It lies here, within the Ring of Valor. Step into the arena, right through this door behind me. I will test your skills.31015Pandaria is rich with history, legends, stories, and lore of every sort. While you are traveling throughout the world I would ask that you keep an eye open for artifacts and pieces of information that you feel would be pertinent to our work here.When you accumulate enough knowledge, we will compile it in to a volume for your personal collection here.You can, of course, return whenever you like to review the volumes we are making for you.31016Dear $p,We have uncovered something tremendous in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. A great repository of books, scrolls, and lore that has remained untouched since the days of the mogu empire.Please, join us at your earliest convenience. You can find this Seat of Knowledge by traveling to the infamous Mogu'shan Vaults, and then flying to the landing just above the entrance.I look forward to your arrival!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho31018The Klaxxi have detected the existence of another paragon, Wakener.This one was kept well-hidden from us, and for good reason.The Empress already has possession of this one, and her adjuncts work to destroy it even now.They are performing their sorcery in a chamber deep beneath the palace, and they must be stopped.We hold Klaxxi'vess. You must go in our stead. Find the entrance to their chamber from the ledge to the west.31019In order for our efforts against the mantid empire to continue, we require more amber.There is a great deposit of amber underneath the lake to the south, but the area is inhabited by a savage saurok tribe.I cannot spare anyone else. You must go to the lake and test the tribe's strength. Thin their numbers and eliminate their leader, who is probably hiding in his underground cavern.Surely this is not too great a task for you?31020I must join the Klaxxi Council and the other paragons immediately, but I am barely strong enough to stand.I must feed, Wakener.I sense the beating hearts of creatures on the northern bank of the lake.Kill them for me, and I shall do the rest.31021Liquid amber is most efficient for restoring a newly awakened paragon's strength, and is usually provided at a wakening ceremony.Unfortunately, it seems you did not receive these instructions, so we shall have to improvise.I can sense a vast quantity of fossilized amber in the lake below us. It will serve, but I am too weak to dig it up myself.Do this for me, and I will see to it that you are rewarded.31022What is that tree on the hill to the west? Can it be... Kypari Zar?When I returned from my final ravage, before being elevated to a paragon, I was given the honor of planting that very tree.I see it has grown into a great kypari, but... it seems something is amiss.There is an old sonar tower at the base of the tree. Take me there, Wakener. I can use the tower to take a closer look.31023This strange-looking carving is covered in a complex written language that might be mantid in origin.You notice more relics strewn carelessly among the camps and inside the lake.Perhaps the Klaxxi would be interested in examining these artifacts.Who knows? Perhaps it will earn you some favor.31024As Kovok grows, he will require equal parts discipline and reward.I lack no shortage of discipline, but our supply of meat is almost empty.To the south, you will find turtles roaming north of the Lake of Stars and Kypari Zar.Hunt them. Kovok likes the taste of their flesh.31026Kypari Zar is dying.A creature of terrible darkness corrupts it from deep beneath its roots.The tree cannot be saved, but at least we can lessen its pain.Look. The vile creature has carved a path to its own lair. We need only follow it down the hill, just behind this tower.31027Now that the pool of life is cleansed, the way to the crypt's interior is open.  Make your way down there and defeat the abomination.31030This... is unspeakable. If the monastery has truly been taken over by the Sha, we will need a great effort to purge the monks inside of corruption.Gather a group of your allies, and meet me inside the Monastery.31031This... is unspeakable.

She is not easily defeated.If you can prove your worth to her, you will win a valuable friend.31039Our scouts have discovered a heavy mogu force at Shan'ze Dao to the northwest.The island was supposedly uninhabited, so their presence is disturbing news.Even more disturbing is the fact that they are performing sinister experiments on the island.I need a capable  to check out the situation.The Shan'ze are likely to give you trouble, and if they do, kill them.31040The Darkwoods sprites on Shan'ze Dao have fallen to the mogu's domination.The once sly tricksters are now the full servants of the Shan'ze. They grow bolder each day, stealing and killing to satisfy their masters.They must be eliminated, but be careful. They may look harmless, but they are actually quite vicious.31041Eggs. Yes, you heard me right. I said eggs, and these aren't for eating.Have you ever seen a cloud serpent egg?These rare eggs look like jewels, and were once worth their weight in solid gold.Shan'ze Dao to the north normally teems with wild cloud serpents, but the mogu and the sprites have their eggs on lock-down.We need to save as many of these precious eggs as we can.I'm counting on YOU, .31042The Shan'ze Serpentbinders dominate the minds of wild cloud serpents, but they also create their own dark creatures from stone, metal, blood, and ancient sorcery.Their creations, the Onyx Stormclaws, guard the island to the northwest.I wish to study the magic binding these creatures. Bring me their hearts, so that I can better understand what sorcery we are up against.31043It is said that Shan'ze Dao was once home to a great mogu temple.There, the Shan'ze studied and practiced the art of subjugating the dead or inanimate.Much of their knowledge still remains on the island to the northwest, buried among the ruins.We need to get our hands on their knowledge - both to keep it out of their hands, and to understand the nature of their experiments.31044Among the Shan'ze's fiercest and most loyal creations are their quilen.These beasts will hunt until they kill their prey, or die in the process.I need you to not only cull their numbers, but also to retrieve their bronze claws.Their claws are strong and razor sharp, and we can use them to make weapons and hooks for our cause.31045, I need your strength to eliminate the Shan'ze Illusionists on Shan'ze Dao, to the northwest.It wearies me to ask of you this difficult task.The illusionists are among the strongest of the Shan'ze's elite sorcerors.They will not be easy to defeat, but I know no  who is better suited to the task.31046I have seen the cruel experiments that the Shan'ze are performing on their island to the northwest.The Shan'ze raise baby serpents from the egg. They keep the young in tiny cages, surrounded by squalor and filth.The cruelest gaolers starve and torture them.We must save as many hatchlings as we can. You have my full permission to punish any mogu that gets in your way!31047Do you know the story of the great cloud serpents of Pandaria, ?Someday you must hear it. Unfortunately, there is no time to tell it now.What you must know is that the wild cloudrunner serpents of Townlong are in trouble.The mogu are capturing wild serpents and corrupting their minds, bending them to their sinister will.Go to Shan'ze Dao, to the northwest. Free the adult serpents from their chains. Save them!31048We've found ancient mogu burial urns among the ruins on Shan'ze Dao.This is normally no problem, except these urns are home to angry mogu spirits.Not only do these urns pose a danger to anyone unlucky enough to find one, but they could be used for destruction if they were to fall into the wrong hands.We must rid Shan'ze Dao of their presence.31049The sprites of Shan'ze Dao have always been capricious tricksters, but now they have fallen under the mogu's influence.Even as we speak, they gather under a new leader.We cannot allow this to happen.Their mischievous pranks were one thing, but united, their dark magic is too powerful and too dangerous to comprehend.Take out their leader before it is too late.310503105131052310533105431055Dear $p,We have received your research on the saurok and believe we have pieced together clues about their past.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho31061Shan Bu, the leader of the Shan'ze, is performing some kind of dark ritual at the summit of the island to the northwest.We believe that the subjugated Shan'ze Cloudrunners are powering the spell.

Go and defeat him or do not return here.31067The mantid don't ever make my job easy, but now they've gone too far.We can fend off the occasional attack from Kor'vess, but now... now they're starting to surround us. What's worse, they're draining the amber from our tree.This will not stand! We need that amber! To make beer!They've dug a burrow into the south side of the tree. I'm short-handed here. Could you take care of them for me?31068\"When the horror comes a-risingAnd the heavens hum with warOur great vessel of salvationMust be broken from its core.\"The scroll continues on for several stanzas. Perhaps somebody at The Sunset Brewgarden will be able to decipher its cryptic message.31069About that scroll you found...I keep looking at that line in the second stanza - \"bound with wood and shade\". The \"shade\", in particular, intrigues me.I must admit, I've often considered taking some of the area's residual sha essence and incorporating it into a brew. I suspect that this is the shade which our recipe calls for.You will find large amalgamations of sha to the southeast of our tree... though you may also be able to harvest some from the local wildlife.31070That recipe said: \"rending daggers of the great ones\"...Mushan! That's it!There's plenty of mushan roaming out there with these great, big teeth... they're as long as daggers. That's gotta be what the recipe calls for.31071I have failed my fellow brewers.I took some supplies out to the clearing, east of our tree... and I left them there. Now, with the sha corrupting the land, and the mantid on the prowl, it is too dangerous for me to bring them back.If you would help me look for them, perhaps I could regain some of my lost honor.31072Forget about them, and forget their BREW. We've got real work to do.The scroll mentions \"rending daggers of the great ones\". I've got a feeling I know where to find them.A pair of mantid lieutenants patrol the Horrid March, to the south. Each one carries a ceremonial dagger.Bring those daggers back here, . We may be on the brink of something big.31073Hmm... \"bound with wood\". We don't typically brew with wood. Sap, yes... but not wood.We have, on rare occasions, infused our drinks with corewood from the treants to the west of here. Most of them have fallen to the mantid... but their remains should suffice for our recipe.31074\"Rending daggers of the great ones shall be bound with WOOD and SHADE.\"  Hmm.I've learned a lot about the Kor'thik mantid in my time here. I know that they maintain shrines within their settlement, Kor'vess.One is a heartroot of the very tree that they inhabit. The other is a dark pillar, connecting them with their queen.These shrines are the wood and shade. If my predictions are right... the daggers should react in their presence.31075Olon had a clever idea. He thinks that we should visit the sprites to the west, and ask them if they have any of these ingredients. Some of the elements to this recipe are seeming... strange.The Rikkitun sprites have a village to the west of Kor'vess. I hope to see you there, .31076Greetings, . I am Chen Stormstout.I'm looking for my family. I am told that several Stormstouts came across the wall to help face the mantid threat. I mean to find them, and join them.Have you seen anyone named Stormstout come through here? Would you mind helping me ask around?31077I was too late. She was so small... and I was too late.She should be given a proper burial. A little warrior like her deserves better than this.31078There will be time for mourning later. For now, there are other Stormstouts to be found.They say that Han Stormstout was last seen exploring Kor'vess. I suspect he headed into that mantid burrow, just across the way.You should meet me down there, . I don't doubt that I can handle a few mantid by myself... but I'd feel better with you by my side.31079We are protected from the mantid. Such was the agreement made so many millenia ago.There are forces from which we are not safe, however. The kyparites beneath the ground to the west will haunt us, chase us... even eat us. The mistlurkers eat our kind by the handful.Help our people, outsider. Defeat our enemies.31080I think that old paper said something about \"fiery wings.\" Those little dragons around here have wings. They're kind of fiery, in a way.You're quicker than me. Try catching some of those dragons... or at least slapping the powder off of them.No point in killing a harmless little dragon, if all you want is the sparkle from their wings.31081I suspect we are going to need the help of these sprites.We have two enchanted daggers, bound together with wood and shade. Now we need someone to perform ancient \"incantations\" on our artifact.Before we ask for favors, let's show the sprites that we mean well. I heard their leader talking about a pair of mistlurkers that kidnapped several of their villagers. If we slay these fog beasts... we may get the \"incantation\" we need in return.31082I know what you and the girl-panda seek. We can perform the rite for you... in time.First, I require aid. The seeds fall from our great mother-tree. It is our responsibility to collect them, even in dangerous times like these.Escort my chanters to the motherseeds, that they may bring them back to the collection pit.31083As soon as the creature died, a strange group of sprites appeared and took its pearl away.The sprites have a village nearby, called Rikkitun Village. Perhaps you should investigate.31084It has been a very, very long time since our tribe has been called on to perform this rite. I will do the best I can.31085We've found the blades, bound them together with wood and shade, and blessed them with an ancient incantation. If I'm not mistaken, it's time to use this thing.The sprites spoke of an ancient piece of sap within the Amber Hibernal, a mantid cave near their empress' palace. That must be the \"Blood of Ancients\" that the prophecy spoke of.Whatever's inside that sap must be important. Good luck, .31086Lya and I agree on one thing: \"Blood of Ancients\" is almost certainly the sap from the great trees of the area. I should know - I brew with the stuff all the time.The most ancient tree of all is the one that Grand Empress Shek'zeer calls her home, now known as the Heart of Fear. Find some amber from that tree, and our brew should be complete.31087The Klaxxi'va hear another paragon. His cries are weak and lost in darkness. The signal must be strengthened.There is a tower in Amberglow Hollow that has been silent for many years. It must sing; the Klaxxi demand it!This time I will go with you. You will help me repair it.Take the resonating crystal and meet me in Amberglow.31088The Stinging Trail nurtures young Kypari trees. The empress drains the saplings too early, outsider. They must grow before the amber can be taken.The Klaxxi'va demand punishment for this crime! It will please them if you rain death on the Ik'thik harvesters.31089The Klaxxi'va have spoken to me, outsider. The paragon is hidden in the Briny Muck only, he is not so hidden anymore.The lizard men surround him. He cannot fall into their scaley hands.You will find him; you will awaken him. Do not return without him!If you do this the Klaxxi will be pleased with us.31090It is a crime to harvest the young trees, but a much bigger crime to waste the amber.Young amber is not as strong, but the Klaxxi need it to continue the fight. We will bring them more and they will sing my praises!Gather the young amber. We will store it until it is aged and can be consumed.31091You look at me and see I am no great warrior. Why was I chosen to be a Paragon? Not all weapons can be seen, Wakener. One should not judge by appearance alone.Before I explain further, I need to know that you are trustworthy.Something precious to me was hidden at the time of my preservation. I am nothing without it.Defend me as I unearth my greatest weapon, and you will have my trust.31092After years of working with the Kunchong I developed a theory; raising one from infancy would strengthen the bond and therefore strengthen the sonic connection.I had just begun training Kovok when I was chosen for encasement. He is still very young and will need diligent training to reach his full potential.I'm entrusting Kovok to you, but be warned; if any harm comes to him your life is forfeit.First, you must feed him to gain his trust. The turtles in the area should be suitable for this.31093Dear $p,Your research into the hozen has proven quite enlightening.If you visit us at the Seat of Knowledge in Vale of Eternal Blossoms we can add this contribution to your personal collection.Thank you for your diligence!Sincerely,Lorewalker Cho31094Dear $p,I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your research in to the jinyu.

We need more arcane powder!It would take us months to get a shipment sent out to us, but luckily, the mogu on this island carry plenty for their own spells.They tend to use some older stuff, so we're going to need a lot of it.31111The warriors of Zan'vess are some of the most feared and respected in the empire, for good reason.Impalers are unmatched in their mastery of the polearm - no doubt Malik trained among the Zan'thik in his time. Their manipulators command terrifying sonic power with the ease and subtlety of a breath.Both will need to be dealt with.31112The crate, once full of desperately needed supplies, has been thoroughly pillaged.A quick scan of the area shows evidence left behind by the thieves. Icy thorns, just like the ones on the water sprites on the shoreline to the east.This is a life or death situation for your band of survivors. Those supplies need to be retrieved from these thieving pests and returned to camp.31113The Yaungol are a constant nuisance, but the group at Fire Camp Gai-Cho, to the northeast, conspired with the Osul yaungol in their recent incursion into Kun-Lai.We cannot allow such an incursion to go unpunished.Go, attack Fire Camp Gai-Cho. We need to make sure they remain occupied, so that they cannot rise up and threaten The Ox Gate again.31114We have always left the Deadtalkers alone. For so long, they were just responsible for maintaining the sacred burial grounds of the yaungol tribes.Now, though, they are practicing dark magic, defiling the corpses of their former clanmates... I know not where they learned those dark magics, or why they no longer treat their dead with respect, but we do not have time to find out. We need to stop them.3111531116The spirits that the Yaungol are entrapping from the remains of their ancestors still have a bit of the essence of life within them. If you defeat the spirits in battle, you can collect essence from the spirits as dust, and then return it to the corpses in the area, which will send the spirits, finally, to the next life.This is the only way to set right what the Deadtalkers have done. It will also help keep us safe.31117Uruk is the Deadtalker of the Townlong yaungol. Your mission will not be truly complete until you defeat him. Go to it!31118We need to understand what went wrong with the Deadtalkers. For so many years, the Deadtalkers were simply responsible for maintaining the burial grounds and holding funerals for fallen warriors.From a recent raid, we've recovered a tablet from the grounds that is clearly written using a cipher, but it isn't one we've encountered before. If you can gather a ciphered scroll from one of the Deadtalkers, we can begin to put together the cypher and understand what's happened.31119The mantid are our enemies. As are the yaungol at Fire Camp Gai-Cho.It is fortunate, then, that they are also each other's enemies. Mantid from Kri'vess constantly attack the Gai-Cho yaungol, who hold them off at their front gates.I want you to wreak havoc. \"Borrow\" some highly explosive oil barrels from camp Gai-Cho, and toss them down onto the battlefield from the air.I don't care which ones you kill, just kill a lot of them.31120Cheng Bo is the Warbringer of Fire Camp Gai-Cho.

But first, I would like to know a little more about you and your people.Come, help me with my chores, and we will chat.You have the look of a grizzled war veteran, but certainly you have a few minutes to help a bookish Pandaren like myself putter around the house, yes?31132Oh, where have my manners gone? Technically, I suppose I am the host here.Allow me to tell you a little bit about myself and my people before asking questions of you.31133I'm no brewer - just looking at all those heaps of ingredients makes my head spin. Just put the brew in front of me when it's finished, thank you.No, I'm here to make sure that the brewers don't get cut in half while they're trying to make that perfect brew. It's not an easy job.The Kor'thik mantid across this basin have been attacking us nightly. If you're already heading over there, why don't you return the favor and attack a few of them?31134This is a very ancient place, traveler.Only recently have I pieced together a method of translating the forgotten language carved into these stones.Oh, the thrill of discovery!

To that end, our leader, High Tinker Mekkatorque, has assembled a team of trainers to help you learn your arts.Xi, Friend of the Small has visited us from a faraway land and will help oversee your training and adjustment to life on the surface. She's waiting for you on the small practice field across the road.31137I don't know if you'll remember Mekkatorque or not. Nevin and the other gnomes have mentioned that memory loss is pretty common for you survivors.Anyways, High Tinker Mekkatorque is the leader of all the gnomes. He has made a habit of meeting with every rescued survivor personally. You should introduce yourself to him. He'll be with his war council beneath the tent in the center of town.31138When you fight, you grow in skill. As you grow in skill, you will begin to figure out new moves.

It is , right?You've arrived just in time. The Blackrock orcs have managed to sneak into Northshire through a break in the mountain. My soldiers are doing the best that they can to push them back, but I fear they will be overwhelmed soon.Head northwest into the forest and kill the attacking Blackrock worgs! Help my soldiers!31140The invading orcs aren't fools. They are sizing us up, making sure that when they attack it will be to their advantage.In the forest, to the northwest, are Blackrock spies.

We must show them that we know they are watching us and that we are prepared!31141I was asked to bring this to your attention as soon as you returned from dealing with the Blackrock spies, .

I wouldn't hesitate to read it before you go about any other business here in the Abbey.31142Now that you've had the chance to test your abilities in battle, it's time to explain one more reason why training is so important.As you get more experience, you'll be able to do new techniques you never thought of.Go, get some experience, learn a new skill, and demonstrate it on one of the training dummies.31143While you were out training I received an urgent message from Sergeant Willem.

Go, now, and develop a mastery of yourself, such that you uncover the Tiger Palm technique. Then, go practice it on a training dummy.31148Actually, before I go - you should speak with Novice Elreth.

What I can help you do is show you where to unlock it.First, you must practice until you begin to understand a new technique. The first technique you learn will be the Tiger Palm. Go, learn more until you have unlocked the potential within yourself, and then practice your new move!Remember - it's all in the mind!31152Just a moment, now. Allow me to gather my things.Wouldn't want me to lose these notes now, would we? Especially after you risked life and limb for them!There, all set. Let us be off, shall we?I must say, I feel much safer traveling with you after seeing how you handled that saurok!311543115531156Ah, while you were gone a parchment came for you, .Read it when you have time. If I'm not mistaken, it came from our Pandaren friend, Gato. He visits from afar to grant us the honor of his wisdom, and to teach the ways of the monk. Do not shame your people by failing at his lessons!31157As you walk the road of your training, you will begin to discover within yourself the power to unlock new techniques. You need not even learn them from me, or another more experienced monk - you will find that they come to you on their own.For now, you should go and practice the basics. Gather more experience, and develop a new technique - once you have, you can practice it on the dummies nearby to master it.31158Alright, mon. We start with da basics. I need ta know dat you know how ta swing dat weapon you're totin' around.Go thrash dose tiki targets. Take it slowly. Natural-like. I'll watch ya fighting form and we'll go from dere.31159Tha Darkspear tribe have long been victims. Outcasts. We found ourselves fleein' our homes time 'n time again... but dis time, it's not fleein' dat drives us here.Vol'jin has offered us leadership through wisdom, and it has kept us alive dis long. Now dat same wisdom offers portents of a chaotic future for tha Horde unda Garrosh Hellscream.No, dis time we not fleein'. Dis time, we are fightin' for a home dat will last.It's time to begin ya trainin', . Speak with Zabrax to the east.31160Lets put dose skills ta use.

Head over to da provin' pit in the middle of dis area and fight a real baddy - one dat wants ta kill ya back. Just let the jailor by the pit know when ya ready.31162As ya get bettah' at fightin', you'll start to find new tings that ya nevah knew you could do.Wanna see? Go, train up some, and learn someting new.'Den come back and ya can show me.31163Ya definitely more den expected, mon. I'm sure dere's more important stuff we can be usin' ya talents on now. Ya don't need ta hang out with da newbloods no more.Head down to da village to da southeast and make yaself known. Lend a hand here and there and I'm sure ya make yer way up to sometin' more prestigious quick enough.31165Just a moment ago a messenger was looking for you, . I believe she was sent by our Pandaren visitor, Shoyu. You should read it.31166You have done well. As you continue along your path, you will grow, learning new techniques that you couldn't have imagined before.Your first lesson is the power of experience. Go, learn a new ability, and demonstrate it for me.31167So there you have it, traveler, or as much of it as would make for a proper introduction, hmm?What of you, then? Are your people so much different than mine?Surely, there must be things we share in common. Let us see...31168This sigil was given to me by a messenger from our Pandaren visitor, Laoxi. It seems he would have words with you when you have a moment. Read it and bring it to him afterwards.31169The true secret to the art of the monk is unlocking the knowledge and power hidden inside yourself.Go, get more experience, and learn a new skill. Then demonstrate it on one of the training dummies.31170As you advance within your class, you will want to take advantage of the training that your class trainer can provide you.  For young monks here on Sunstrider Isle, your trainer is Pao, our Pandaren visitor.  Speak with her and see what training she has available for you.Pao - as with all the trainers on Sunstrider Isle - is inside the Sunspire on the lower level.31171Good. You are off to a bright start. This road will be long, and as you become more accomplished, you will begin to discover that you can do things you could never have imagined before.Go, get more experience, and learn a new technique. Once you have, demonstrate it on one of the training dummies.3117231173I hope your people are all alright... the crash was unbelievably loud and destructive!Yes, you'll do fine. They've said that they need more people to fight, and they don't want me to hurt myself. I'm not afraid, but I don't want to intrude. So, I'll teach you.As you may have discovered, your experiences in combat will unlock new potential within you. Go, see if you can master a new ability. Show it to me. You'll get the hang of things.31175Our efforts to secure the shallows before Zan'vess have paid off.We have spotted another paragon buried in amber, hidden in the waters to the southwest.Adding another paragon to our numbers is vital. Another champion from ages past could turn the tide in our favor.I would go immediately, but unfortunately, I am needed here.Since you are already a Wakener, you can carry out this task in my stead.31176Food. I must have food.In my time, the meat of the starfish brought not only strength, but also clarity of mind. This is what I must eat.Bring this to me from the nearby shallows.Wait much longer, and I will devour you instead.31177In my living years, I was the greatest warrior of the swarm.Help me regain my strength, and I shall show you.I smell the salt sea nearby, and where you can find the sea, you will find briny clackers.Bring me their tails. I must feast upon their flesh.31178A warrior is not ready for battle until he tastes the blood of his enemies.I am still too weak to hunt, so you must go in my stead.Only the blood from the fiercest predators will do. I can smell their presence in the waters outside this cave!Bring this to me, and then perhaps you shall see why they call me the Bloodseeker.31179I'm afraid that I wet my hands with saurok blood while you were away.I'm sorry, but I could not help myself. Now, watch them attack me.Pitiful!Do they think to take vengeance for their fallen? Do they come challenge ME?I, who have won a hundred wars? I, who stood alone against thousands and still shouted for my enemies to come?No, these... saurok... will crumple before me like paper before the flame!I shall show you my might, Wakener. Fight alongside me and see.Here they come!31181We got a load of empty crab pots out there that need fresh bait.Now, we COULD pull them one at a time and bait them up here in comfort. A nice chair to sit on, maybe a hot cup of tea to keep you warm. Sounds nice, doesn't it?Never gonna happen.Head to Lonesome Cove, immediately southwest, and bait those pots with two chunks of fresh sea monarch. By \"fresh\" I mean killed right there in the water.Oh, and by \"pots\" I mean traps. If you wanna be part of the crew, you'd better learn the lingo.31182You know what happened to the bait in those pots?Otters. That's what happened.They prefer fresh clams, but they'll pick our crab traps clean if they're hungry enough.The otters in Lonesome Cove are protected by law and we run a legitimate operation here. As much as I'd love to chum those little rats and call it a day, we just make sure they aren't hungry enough to raid the crab pots.Toss 'em a few clams to keep them busy while you're out there.31183Alright, $p, I got another job for ya.You see that lion seal in the pen over there? Name's Dog. He's been Soggy's pet for years.Dog's acting up lately - I think he's getting restless in that pen. Why don't you go talk to Soggy and let him know.I'd say it's about time you meet the cap'n anyway.31184Look, I ain't got reason to trust you, but there's a task I can't give to my crew.I need you to search the wreck of our old ship, the Mist-Hopper, and bring back the charter. It'd be sealed up in a silver tube, in a footlocker.It's sort of, uh... incriminating. I can't risk any of the crew finding it if they decide to visit the ol' girl. She's resting on the Shelf of Mazu, to the west.I'd suggest riding a rip current out there, if you got the stomach. They're all over the shelf.31185Dog ain't my \"pet.\" He's a member of this crew, and my best friend. Saved my life more than once, you know.But I'm gettin' too old to walk him anymore, and he still needs his exercise. Take Dog for a trip around the shelf for me, would ya?He loves to swim through the hot geysers just southeast of the shallows.He absolutely has to... er... \"leave his mark\" on the dead whale at the far western edge of the shelf.Oh, and he'll want to visit our old shipwreck, too. He likes to reminisce.3118631187I just got word that a string of pots we dropped this morning hit it BIG. We're on the crab!Problem is, the rips are getting stronger and we lost track of some of the pots. They're just sitting out there, filled with spiky blue GOLD!I need you back out there. Hook one of these buoys up to any of the full traps you find and send it to the surface for us.31188Crabbing is our big money-maker, but we send all kinds of goods back around the wall. Oils, plants, even rare minerals - the sea's bounty is rich out here!Right now the big craze in the markets back home is thresher teeth. Apparently they make great necklaces?Threshers are all over the Shelf of Mazu to the west. Bring me lots of teeth!31189I never thought I'd see the day, but for the first time since... well, EVER, Master Angler Ju Lien asked for some help with his lines.Apparently the sea is going crazy today and he can't keep up. See if you can give him a hand. He's fishing just south of here.31190I'm not gonna sit in a damn rocking chair while my crew gets devoured by a leviathan!Come on, let's get to the dock and launch a dinghy. I got a special one set up just for this kind of situation. My own little Mist-Hopper Jr.We'll give that thing a case of harpoon fever.31194The Slitherscale take orders from their leader, the Slitherscale Lizard-Lord. He can be found celebrating his victories on the southeastern corner of Windward Isle.If we can destroy this leader, we can deal their tribe a great blow.Without their lord, the Slitherscale will think twice before attacking the gentle cloud serpents of the east.3119531196The mantid outnumber us quite badly. Hundreds of them for each of us.And, they surround us on two sides - at Gao-Ran in the south we're holding them off, but to the west, on the island they call Sra'vess, they continue to mass unabated.We're not stupid. We're not going to launch a full scale attack on them. We can't sustain an intense battle on multiple fronts.Instead, we're going to send you, and one of our Wu Kao, to do some dirty work. Sounds fun, doesn't it?31197Killing the smaller mantid works mostly as a distraction. It forces them to replenish their numbers before they consider any serious offensive.The big ones, though - we kill a few of those, and we really disrupt operations on the island. That buys ourselves a substantial amount of time. With mantid, it's like their size is directly proportional to their importance in the empire.So kill some of the big ones for me, while you're out there.31198The mantid have statues built on Sra'vess. We don't know exactly what they use them for. They may have some sort of religious significance, or maybe they assist with their sonic communication.When you fight your opponent, you don't just engage them physically, you also engage them mentally. Whatever they use them for, the fact is that those statues are important to them.Which is why I want you to blow them up. Losing something important will be a substantial hit to morale.31199The mantid don't just attack in swarms. They're smart. They use alchemy, bombs... and what's worst, they've got siege weapons. Those have the potential to be incredibly destructive if they attack with them.We've got reports that they're building up a force of siege weapons to the west at Sra'vess. Go and destroy them.31200Our alchemists have cooked up a set of gas bombs that will discourage mantid from staying anywhere that we set them off. If we plant these in the critical structures of Sra'vess, they'll need to evacuate. That should sow some chaos and delay any action from the mantid there for days.Get to it, .31201Our scouts have sent a very troubling report. Three of our trainees have gone missing, and our scouts found them... They've been captured by the mantid and sent to their Kunchong pits. Their Kunchong FEEDING pits. We're lucky that the Kunchong don't eat that often.I need you to get in there, give them these escape kites, and get them out!31203While we're here, we should do one more thing.The Sra'thik Swarmlord is responsible for directing the mantid forces from the air. If we leave it alive, it's going to cause trouble for the garrison.So we're not going to leave it alive. Let's take it out, $p.31204Near the ocean, on the eastern side of Sra'vess, there is a cavern that leads to a network of caves.From there, the Sra'thik Hivelord maintains Sra'vess and plots against us. If we manage to take him out, we'll disrupt their operations for days.Let's go to it.3120531206I'll tell you what, buddy, this place is a far cry from the rolling plains of Nagrand or the bloodbowl in Zul'Drak, but hey, I go where the gold's at! So welcome to Twi-Hi, pal.You're new to this pit, so let me set you straight. I'm the fight promoter and this feisty troll next to me is Wodin, my bodyguard. You're the entertainment. When you wanna fight, let me know and I'll set up the match.If you're ready and got a group of friends with you, we can start! What do you say?31207Ah, I can still remember running fights out of a muddy hole in the ground back in Nagrand. We've come a long way, eh, Wodin?I tell you, there's nothing more these Tiger monks like than a good scrap. So much so that they've paid good coin for me to set up shop here and help draw the strongest fighters from all around!So how about it? You and a couple friends up for a few rounds in the Arena of Annihilation...? Big money, big prizes!31208If we are to strike against the Empress, we must arm ourselves with weapons. My own choice of weapon is of a particularly toxic design.The scorpions wandering the ledge produce a deadly venom that they store in their tails.Bring me their stingers, and I will show you how I earned the title of paragon.31209I require another ingredient to create my first poison, Wakener.This ingredient you can easily find on the scarabs nearby.Kill them and bring me their wings.31210The last ingredient is perhaps the deadliest.The dreadshade flower grows all along these hills.It is by eating these poisonous plants that the local wildlife has become so venomous.A single drop of dreadshade nectar can stop a kunchong's heart.Go and bring me some of these flowers. Do not be tempted to taste them.31211Before we return to Klaxxi'vess, I wish to look upon the empire.The Klaxxi Council told me that the enemy gathers outside the Empress's palace.My poisons are ready. What better way to announce my return than with death and destruction?Just be careful not to mix the two serums... at least not while you're holding the vessels.Speak to me when you are ready to fly.31212312133121431216The swarm begins, Wakener! The mantid amass at the Heart of Fear.Already they fill the skies with their wings and rend the earth with their claws. They shall not stop the dark march until their bodies are laid open and bleeding upon the ground.This we shall gladly do. We will attack them from above. While I fly, use my poisons to destroy their advance.Do not mix the two serums until you are ready to attack. The reaction can be quite... violent.Speak to me when you are ready to go.312183121931220You've really been building up respect with the Shado-Pan, .Nurong's interested in trying out his skills against you.The good news is, if you win, I'll allow him to go with you on your missions.The bad news is, I really don't think you'll win.31221So... you've been challenged by the infamous Tenwu of the Red Smoke.That's what he calls himself, at least. He's a good fighter, and a good rogue, but it's a wonder he manages to sneak up on anyone with how loudly he brags about himself.Anyways, I think you should answer the challenge. Maybe it'll give him a touch of humility. Maybe not. Either way, if you win, he'll probably be willing to go with you on your missions. And I get some entertainment.31228Prophet Khar'zul is a powerful caster, but he is also underestimating your abilities.Khar'zul and his forces must be destroyed to protect this village. His death will send a strong message to the Thunder King that we will not be defeated!You'll find him on the Isle of Reckoning.31230Cho's off on another one of his adventures, and this one requires a big order of jade. I'm going to have to call in some favors.How 'bout in the meantime you introduce yourself to some of the locals.Kai Wanderbrew is a good guy to know, as is Master Windfur. Oh, and say hi to Peiji Goldendraft up at the inn.Between the three of them, you should get the feel for life in Dawn's Blossom.31231Back in Gurthani Terrace where you found me, dreadspinners continue to occupy the attention of Shado-Pan marksmen who could otherwise be thinning out this wretched swarm.Eradicate those spiders and offer some relief to the archers on that wall.31232My brothers speak of an ancient mogu empire that once dwelled in the ruins to the east.Once, this tribe knew untold secrets of sorcery and subjugation.I have a curious mind, Wakener, and I wish to learn of the empires that ruled after my time.Knowledge of the past will determine our future.Go search the ruins for their ancient tablets. I will study their secrets and make them our own.31233I found a grove of young amber trees to the east, Wakener.I've placed tapping devices on these trees, but I have been too busy to retrieve the sap.I need someone to find the extractors. Activate them, then bring me samples of the amber.31234Ah! Wakener! You must help me! (You will help me, or else I will help myself to you!)I need more materials for my experiments, yes yes! (Blood and guts, hearts and brains, tongues and eyes, eyes, eyes!)To the west, I have seen creatures of mist and fog. They possess such big, round, wonderful globes! Big for seeing, round and unblinking!Go now, little Wakener. Bring me back a single pristine eye!31235I recovered this weapon on a recent scouting run near the wall. It would seem ideal for helping your Shado-Pan with their infestation problem in Gurthani Terrace.The more they are focused on keeping spiders off the wall, the less time they are killing fear-gripped swarmborn.31237If this Empress is truly possessed by fear and paranoia, she will have sent scouts to every corner of the land in order to cement her control.These scout grubs are likely everywhere, but difficult to spot with the naked eye. Better to track them by the pheromone trails they leave behind.I've already... gifted you... a reactive toxin that will reveal these trails to you for a brief time after experiencing the thrill of victory.Go now to the Terrace of Gurthan and root out these spies.31238Kovok is growing at an accelerated rate, but his brain may not be able to keep up. He'll require a special diet to ensure that he does not outgrow the capacity to control his own body.Mushan tongue is rich in the nutrients that promote brain growth in kunchong, but they normally eat the beasts whole and fill up quickly. If we feed Kovok only mushan tongues every couple of days or so, it should balance out his growth.Greatback mushan graze the hills east of here, near the Gurthani Terrace.31239So, you wanna be a hozen. Huh, wikket?Hozen defend their lands from enemies, like jinyu.Kah Kah fought many jinyu fights, and won them all.Hozen only give name name to good grookers. Go grook jinyu and maybe they call you  .Jinyu creepin' down by the river. Ook 'em in the dooker!31241 good wikket, they say... help hozen, they say...No more grookin' , they say.That ok. Look out there. Wicked wikkets fallin' like rain, ripe for the grookin'!Go, join the fun. But remember, Chief Kah Kah gets all the shinies! That's hozen rule number two.Hmm, all hozen rules are number two...31251Yeah, yeah.Everyone knows us goblins do tinkering. And explosives. And... well, ya' know, the less reputable stuff.But what nobody knows is that I'm really a great chef! It's a hobby of mine.Gather us up some meaty bits from the creatures around here, and I'll cook us up the best meals ANYWHERE!And I promise, I'll only use three or four percent rocket fuel.31252Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do.I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest. And, since you helped them out, they want to join your \"Alliance.\" So, who am I to stop 'em?Bring 'em with you, back to Farmhand Bo. I'll miss 'em, but they're better off with you.31253Well, far as I figure, we've got quite a lot of rebuildin' to do.I'm not one for joining any big causes, but my farmhands aren't gonna have much to do 'round here, to be honest.

Very dangerous to travel there, yes, very dangerous.Look for guides along the road to help you find your way.31255Ah! Greetings friend of Lorewalker Cho. I have a message for you.The Lorewalker waits for you in Kun-Lai. Very dangerous to travel there, yes, very dangerous.Look for guides along the road to help you find your way.31256Lok'tar, .We've made progress, but we're going to need mobility if we want to maintain our foothold here in Kun-Lai.I don't see many worgs, kodo, or the like around here. What I do see are yaks. Our pandaren allies have said they make good mounts, so they'll have to do.Go round some up and return them here, so we can get our people riding them!31260I am totally on to another great scam!When I was flying overhead I saw a really ancient tigress prowling about.Do you know how much her blood would go for on the black market? Not to mention if I convince some warlocks it adds extra potency to their summoning spells or something.If you bring me back some of her blood I will cut you in on the scam. She was prowling about on the far side of the Dojani River from here.31261Gore from Captain Jack's head drips and mysteriously seeps into the ground as you examine your hard-won trophy.Strange, but no time to investigate that now. There's too much work to be done.The chieftain of your newfound friends will doubtlessly be impressed with this proof of your grookin' skills.31262So, now that you've got a vibe for how cranes fight, I've got a doozy for you.Needlebeak!Or at least, that's what I'm calling him. Biggest crane I ever saw. And its beak is so sharp it's like a sword.Northwest of here you'll find the big water fall that kicks off the Dojani River. Needlebeak likes to hang out by the waterfall.You bring me its beak as a trophy and I will talk you up a good game to Nesingwary.31265Here to help, are ya? Well, first thing's first.Here it is! \"Mazu's Breath.\" Cap'n's own formula.What? You thought I'd send you out to sea without a means of breathin'? I need deckhands, not corpses!Down the hatch with it, green. This'll give you a fighting chance out there on the shelf.31266We've heard reports of a group of Mogu infiltrating the coast here in Townlong. I have no idea what they are doing. Frankly, I don't care. You've proven yourself, so we've decided to give this mission to you.What's going to happen is this - you're going to go, find them, and kill them.Our scouts reported the first group landed to the north, between here and Deadtalker's Plateau. Go there and wipe them out.31267Korven has told me of his findings. There is an enormous amber deposit sitting at the bottom of the Lake of Stars.Unfortunately, a hostile saurok tribe lives at the edge of the lake, and revere the amber as their own.They will not allow us to enter their territory easily.Go south to the lake. Kill the Mistblade saurok, so that we can more easily harvest the nearby amber.31268Far to the south, the swarm breeds weapons of destruction - enormous, nearly unbreakable amber scorpions.Like all other creatures, they are subject to manipulation, but unlike other creatures, they have not yet submitted to my mind control.It appears that further research is necessary before I can dominate them for our own purposes.I must study their brains, and you must retrieve some specimens for me.Take this sonic emitter. I have found it to be quite effective against the beasts.31269The saurok at the Lake of Stars take their orders from their Scale-Lord, a vicious, merciless leader who guards his territory fiercely.If we can eliminate this leader, then we can gain access to the enormous amber lode beneath the lake.Go. Their leader gives his orders from his underground dwelling, at the southern edge of the lake.31270When we discovered the sha influence at Kypari Zar, I had hoped the corruption could still be cleansed.Unfortunately, the Klaxxi Council has confirmed that the sha of fear's corruption is deep-seated, and continues to spread.To the south, I have observed some of the local wildlife consumed by an unnamed terror.The sha can warp and twist its victims into unimaginable horrors.We must stop the corruption before it becomes worse. Seek out the sha-infected Horrorscale Scorpids. Eliminate them.31271Far to the south, Wakener, the Empress's genemancers set about their dark experiments. (Dark yes, but not as dark as mine!)They dissect and mutate the nearby wildlife, breeding creatures of their own design. (Their design, which will become my design!)We must not let them succeed! (No, no! Only I am allowed such power!)Their mutations are already being unleashed for war. Go! Destroy them at any cost!31272The Empress's genemancers play with dangerous toys.To the south, they are injecting local wildlife with pheromone-laden parasites, in an attempt to create monstrous mutations for war.Carelessly, they have allowed their parasitic worms to escape into the local ecosystem.Left unchecked, the infection will spread from one animal to another, until we have an outbreak.I will inject you with a mild toxin. With it, you will be able to identify infected creatures.Kill the carriers at once.312743127531277Those damnable Mogu...Those scouts were a distraction! While we were hunting their spies, the main force moved on Niuzao Temple. Corrupted serpents, Mogu everywhere... this is a disaster!Thankfully, Ban was able to make it past their lines with the most elite members of our order. If you can slip past, too, meet up with him. We need to put a stop to this!31278Whee!  You get to make a breadcrumb quest!  Now figure out what to do next.31279I'm so glad you enjoy my food. Are you interested in the recipes?  If so, you should learn them properly, from my teachers in Halfhill Market.  Everything I know about the kitchen, I learned from them.Say, if you happen to pass through there, would you deliver this note to Sungshin Ironpaw for me?

I particularly enjoy this one:\"The timid feel fear before trouble starts; the cowards feel fear as trouble happens. The bravest among us feel fear only after the troubles have been taken care of.\"Is that true? Let's find out.The Sha of Fear has fled into the Terrace of Endless Spring.

She was my favorite teacher, and I want her to know that I miss her.31487Relying on sonic whispers to manipulate the kunchong was only the most primitive stage of my research, and yet the Empire seems to have adopted the practice wholly. The manipulators of the Shek'zeer are too impatient to form a proper bond with their kunchong.Their laziness will cost them dearly.Strike this tuning fork near the dread kunchong in the clutches - watch as they reel in confusion and lash out at their masters.

Their exceptional agility and endurance were, in my time, the feats of incredibly skilled or mature fliers.This would seem to indicate some kind of evolution in wing structure... Or perhaps a result of advancements in training? Induced genetic mutation? Selective breeding?Gah! There's no way to know for certain without tissue samples.Bring me their wings! And try not to ruin them in the process, will you? I need them intact!31503There is a champion among the loyalists, Vess-Guard Na'kal, whose strength comes not from experience or development, but from genetic modification. He was meant to be an example of the future of mantid - the sick idea that we can be born strong, without earning it.He's a mockery of my work! Gene augmentation was meant for mature, post-swarm veterans ONLY!End him. Perhaps it will serve as a lesson to Grand Empress Shek'zeer that taking shortcuts leads to ruin.31504If the Grand Empress's agents are still operating under security standards from my time, they would have hidden powerful pheromone mines all around the clutches.With mere whisper she could detonate them all simultaneously, engulfing the palace and rendering entire siege armies powerless.If we hope to have any success in a large scale standoff, we need to disable those mines. My... \"gift\" to you when we met will allow you to see the mines. Disturb them and get to a safe distance.31505Vess-Guard Vik'az co-ordinates the defense forces at Zan'vess. He is worth ten mantid in battle, and his presence inspires the Zan'thik who fight alongside him.Needless to say, we need him dead.He patrols the housing area at the center of the island.31506The Zan'thik employ a sizable force of... indentured labor.Yaungol are bound in special shackles which enhance and prolong the effects of sonic manipulation. It is this technology that allows the Zan'thik manipulators to command such large quantities of thralls to endlessly toil for them in the quarries.I would like to study these shackles.31507The venomsting scorpions on Zan'vess are fed sap from a young age, causing a fascinating mutation in which their natural armor plating becomes infused with amber. Effectively, it's organic kyparite, the same substance used in forging most of the empire's weapons and armor.I think I've found a way to chemically break down kyparite, but it needs testing. Use these grenades on the Zan'thik venomstings and observe the results.31508Kyparite worms have shown extreme adaptations in order to mimic the environment around them. They can also grow to immense sizes at rates which are nearly unheard of for most creatures.Their physiology could provide valuable insight into further mutations.Bring me sample shards from the muck tunnelers in the shallows near Zan'vess.31509The fallout from Shek'zeer's madness will continue long after her reign has ended. We will struggle to heal our lands for many years to come, and even then our efforts may prove fruitless.A new species of sha-twisted flora has begun taking root near Zan'vess. Destroy any that you find, but beware - there is no telling what kind of sinister defenses it may have.31510On the southwestern corner of Zan'vess lie the Whispering Stones. Much like the towers here, they are critical in transmitting long-range sonic signals.An adjunct of the Empress operates the stones, keeping her in communication with the Zan'thik forces.

She oversees the great wall that separates the terrors in the Dread Wastes from our bountiful lands to the east.31660Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature.Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on our enemies instead.The swarmborn in the Clutches of Shek'zeer have been tainted. They are born into shadows and nightmares. Driven by terror, not hunger.They are not fit to swarm. They must be purged.3166131664This journal provides a hazy recollection of Nat Pagle's grand adventures.  Simply reading it will undoubtedly provide a useful insight into fishing.31665316663166831669Grandpa always said that the bellweather of a true farmer lies in the quality of his cabbage. Any time a new farmer came into town, he'd buy a few heads of cabbage to see what they knew.Now, I'm the new farmer, and this is my big chance to prove myself. Could you plant some cabbage for me?31670Grandpa always said, \"Carrots ain't nothin but a welcomin' mat for virmen.\" I don't think I ever saw him grow a single carrot.For once, I disagree with Grandpa. I like to live on the edge. Plus, I like to eat carrots.I like to eat carrots on the edge.Could you get some seeds and grow one for me?31671I heard Haohan mentioning that he was going to plant scallions today. I'm not sure if today's the best day for scallions, but I'd like to hope that he knows what he's doing. He is the head of the Tillers' union, after all.Could you plant a scallion for me?31672I heard a rumor around the market that Gina Mudclaw loves the smell of pumpkin blossoms. Maybe if I grow some pumpkins in my farm, she might come and visit a little more often.Could you plant a pumpkin for me?31673Grandpa once told me that the smell of leeks will keep crocolisks off of your property. He must have had a point... he always grew leeks, and I never saw a crocolisk anywhere NEAR his farm.We're pretty far from the water... but I suppose you can never be too sure.31674Old Hillpaw bet me that my land couldn't grow a pink turnip.I'll show him. My land will grow the biggest, pinkest turnip that old coot's ever seen!31675Grandpa often told me to \"Keep my drawers clean and my dirt cleaner.\" It sounds like a joke, but he makes a good point.Vegetables tend to leave behind bits of root that can contaminate your soil... but a nice, big, white turnip will clean that gunk right up. Think you could plant a white turnip for me?31676I can hear them howling in rage... The spirits of the Gurthani mogu I slayed so long ago.

You will help me repair it.Take the resonating crystal and meet me in Amberglow.31680The Stinging Trail nurtures young Kypari trees. The empress drains the saplings too early, outsider. They must grow before the amber can be taken.The Klaxxi'va demand punishment for this crime! It will please them if you rain death on the Ik'thik harvesters.31681It is a crime to harvest the young trees, but a much bigger crime to waste the amber.Young amber is not as strong, but the Klaxxi need it to continue the fight. We will bring them more and they will sing my praises!Gather the young amber. We will store it until it is aged and can be consumed.31682The Klaxxi'va have spoken to me, outsider. The paragon is hidden in the Briny Muck only, he is not so hidden anymore.The lizard men surround him. He cannot fall into their scaley hands.You will find him; you will awaken him. Do not return without him!If you do this the Klaxxi will be pleased with us.31685Yarr, the Jade Forest be goin through some violent reconstruction, but the Valley of the Four Winds is ripe for explorin.

My men have been attempting to extinguish their presence to the west, at Sik'vess, but to no success. If you're half of the  Taran paints you to be, maybe you will fare better.Head west, and kill any Sik'thik mantid you find. And remember, this is no time for mercy. There are lives at the temple depending on us.31688One of my best scouts, Restless Leng, went missing during a mission on the other side of Sik'vess. I'm hopeful that he was captured rather than killed, but with the mantid corrupted so heavily by sha, it doesn't seem likely.Still, can you investigate the cages around Sik'vess? I owe him a more thorough search than even this, but I have no men to spare without allowing our southern lines to break.Please, , even if there's no life left in him, find him that I might know his fate.31689The Klaxxi see far and hear much. They have shared their insight with me.The Vor'thik embrace the sha, using its power to fuel their march in this false swarm. Their warriors consume tainted amber and call themselves dreadsworn.There is no future for them. They are waste which needs disposing.And YOU will begin that process for us when you reach Kypari Vor.31690As powerful it is, at some point you know you will outgrow this staff.

It sounds like they are going after the root of the yaungol invasion.The pandaren have not traveled in force in to Townlong for thousands of years. The Shado-Pan are strong and brave, but they are also proud and few. They will need help from heroes like yourself. Can you travel through the Gate of Winter's Blossom in the northwest? Find the Shado-Pan leaders and lend your help and experience?31698The past few seasons have been plentiful, and as a result, the wild tiger population on Windward Isle has exploded.The savage creatures have hunted out all the nearby game, and are beginning to encroach upon the cloud serpent nests.As a result, as the tigers thrive, the cloud serpents decline.If we are not careful, the predatory cats could completely wipe them out.We must thin the tigers' numbers, .31699Oh bother, how am I supposed to get my tasks done, now?Instructor Skythorn asked me to go kill some tigers at Windward Isle, but I heard the area was overrun with sprites!Ugh! I hate sprites! They totally give me the creeps!They're so small, and... and... they jump on you and... and... they have cold, dead little stick hands!Auuugh! You have to help me, . Get rid of those things, please!31700I loathe sprites! One time, one of those nasty buggers followed me all day, putting dirt in my tea and bugs in my hair.I mean, who does that!?Well, I think it's time for a little payback. Do you know what the sprites up at Windward Isle love more than anything in the world?Yeah, you guessed it. Shoes!And we're going to steal them. Won't that make them mad! Hah!Well, I'm scared to go near sprites, so you'll have to do it, .31701I have learned that a vicious beast, a Windward Huntress, terrorizes the wood on the northwest side of the island.She has already slain several serpents, and injured more than one serpent rider sent to subdue her.She must be removed before she can pose a danger to anyone else. Can you perform this task?31702I have heard report of a great white beast that stalks the wood on the northwestern side of the wild serpent island.This savage creature is mate to the Windward Huntress, and already he has taken down several of the adult cloud serpent matriarchs.We cannot have such a fearsome predator roaming the island unchecked.Go and deal with this creature. Let us see if your training has paid off.31703There is another task I must ask of you.The leader of the woodland sprites is the Shadowfae Madcap.If there is trouble brewing, he is the mastermind pulling the puppet strings.We do not have time to deal with the sprites' tiresome pranks and insolence. Take out the Shadowfae Madcap, and be quick about it.31704You can tell that someone has gotten out of its pen and had \"an accident.\"Well, at the rate that the hatchling's been eating, it had to come out the other end... somewhere.You had better find the serpent's poop and clean it up before the Serpent Masters find out.31705The Arboretum is our home, a safe haven where we raise young hatchlings and train our students.Unfortunately, there are other, more dangerous creatures who wish to make this their home as well.To the north, beyond the river, we have seen a great wasp feeding on the nectar blossoms.This creature has already stung several of our students.Use this honey to lure the wasp out of hiding. Then, destroy it before it harms anyone else.31706The spiders near Sri-La Village have grown very aggressive. They pose a severe problem to the anglers who fish along the coast.For their safety, I need you to go and eliminate the Weeping Widows in The Widow's Wail.You can find the cave along the coast to the north.31707We have had a disturbing report from the Anglers fishermen of Sri-La Village, .Many of their villagers are missing, taken by the spiders who live in The Widow's Wail, a cave along the coast to the north.The victims are dragged into the dark depths, wrapped in cocoons, and left to become the spiders' next meal.We believe that some of the people may still be alive. There is still time to save them! I need you to go and rescue as many villagers as you can find.31708I see you have gained your own hatchling, .Have you been feeding it, cleaning after it, and playing with it properly? Only by doing so will it become strong and healthy.Now let me tell you a trainer's secret. To the north, in The Widow's Wail, you can find a mushroom known as Serpent's Scale.It is difficult to acquire, but this mushroom has powerful properties and important nutrients. Your serpent won't like eating it, but who likes eating their vegetables?31709I heard that there has been some strange behavior down at The Widow's Wail to the north.Hyacinth and I went to investigate, and I am certain that some presence of the sha has found its way into the cavern.I created this device to measure sha energy levels.If you are going that way, would you mind taking measurements of any sha disturbances?The disturbances look like streams of white and black sha energy pouring from the ground.31710As you near, your serpent opens its mouth and begins drooling. It looks quite hungry since you last left it.From the way it whimpers and slaps its tail, you can tell it is not looking for just any treat, but a special favorite snack.Your serpent loves to munch on tiny spider eyes, but this delicacy comes only from the Widowspawn spiders in the cave along the coast to the north.Well, what's a rider to do? Your serpent is waiting.31711The problem with the sha of doubt, , is its deceitful pervasiveness.Once the seed of doubt is planted, it can grow like an unwelcome weed.Such a seed has been planted in The Widow's Wail to the north, and like a weed, we must extinguish its presence immediately.I need you to destroy the lingering fragment of doubt before it can infect any more victims.31712Strange tales have reached our ears from Sri-La Village.It seems that a hozen tribe has made itself comfortable in Oona Kagu, a cave along the coast south of the fishing village.Too comfortable, in fact. The tribe members are stealing and pillaging resources all along the coast.We must teach them a lesson... one that can only be taught by force. They have already overstayed their welcome.31713It's a disaster, !When I went to visit the Dancing Serpent Inn yesterday, they were all out of brew. They said the shipment from Sri-La Village had been stolen. STOLEN!Turns out those Oona hozen have been making all kinds of trouble down at the docks, including taking all the brew to their cave at Oona Kagu along the coast.I can't handle a dry spell. A life without brew is not a life worth living!Someone needs to go and save the brew!31714Those Oona hozen have gone too far this time.Do you know what they are doing with wild cloud serpents? Captured hatchlings are forced to fight one another in the pits, for nothing more than the Oona's amusement.Savages!If the young hatchlings learn such aggressive behavior at a young age, they may become violent and corrupted adults. A malicious cloud serpent is not something we want to deal with.We must save the hatchlings.31715The leader of the Oona hozen is a brigand by the name of Lord Oona.I have heard fearsome tales of this roaming sea captain and his crew. Everywhere he takes his tribe, destruction follows.The Oona land their boats on fertile soil, pillage the local villages, and drain the land dry before moving on to their next conquest.We shall not allow the same to occur on our shores, not while I am still in charge.I need someone to go eradicate him now.31716As it looks at you with bashful eyes, you can tell that someone has gotten out of its pen and had... an accident.Well, at the rate that the serpent's been eating, it had to come out the other end... somewhere.You had better find the serpent's poop and clean it up before the Serpent Masters find out.31717You are rising up the ranks of our students, .Just as a sword must be forged through fire, so must our students test themselves against one another.Today, you will spar against one of our brightest disciples, Ace Longpaw. In order to defeat him, you will need to make use of your defensive capabilities.Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck.31718Are you ready for another lesson, ?Today, you will spar against Big Bao. He is large of stature and of heart, and he will not give up until he is wholly beaten.If you wish to defeat him, you will need to persevere.Speak to him in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck.31719You show much promise, . However, talent is worth little without discipline and humility.Today, you will face Ningna Darkwheel. Her natural strength makes her one of our most talented students. If you hope to defeat her, you will need to act with the utmost control.Speak to her in the training ring to begin the challenge. Good luck.31720Today you will face Suchi the Sweet in the training ring. Despite her sweet exterior, she is a tough opponent.She attacks swiftly and surely, but such potent attacks can become tiring over time.If you hope to defeat her, you will need to concentrate your damage when she is weakened.Speak to Suchi to begin the duel. Good luck.31721Qua-Ro Whitebrow is commonly considered the best student of the Order.He seems quite without weakness. He is quick of intellect, strong of arm, hard-working, and talented.When you face him in the training ring, you will be testing yourself against our best.Speak to him to begin the duel. No matter the outcome, you will learn much from challenging him.31723Yarr, the Jade Forest be goin through some violent reconstruction, but the Valley of the Four Winds is ripe for explorin.  I can help ye on yer way if ye wants to explore it.  Be sure to check out me wares for some equipment that may help ye on yer journey.31724You're tough for just starting out!Old MacDonald taught me everything I know about battling. I think fighting him would be a great learning experience for you!He can be found just across the bridge leading to Westfall. Don't let his age fool you, he's already beaten quite a few up-and-coming trainers like yourself.31725Are you ready to show off what you can do? There's a little girl up in Redridge Mountains that has made a real storm on the battle scene.Find Lindsay at the dock at Camp Everstill. She may be young, but her impressive record is nothing to be scoffed at!31726I heard all my friends talking about a scary worgen called Eric Davidson in Duskwood that nobody ever fights with their pets.I bet if you found and beat him, people might talk about you instead!31727If this war is to be won we cannot afford to leave anything unchecked, outsider.There is a disturbance along the coast that needs to be investigated. The presence there is not our kind and are of no value to us. However, their supplies could prove very valuable.If there is anything of use there we must get to it before the empress.31728My longtime friend, fellow trainer, and infamous drunkard Bill Buckler of the Cape of Stranglethorn, has issued an open challenge to prepared trainers!You should answer his call and really put your skills to the test. He tends to wander the southern roads of the Cape.31729If you thought I was tough, prepare yourself. The road only gets harder from here.Find Steven Lisbane wandering the roads in the southern parts of Northern Stranglethorn. Seek him out and see who the superior tamer is!31730Scouts have reported a non-mantid presence near Kor'vess. Their intrusion and their theft of amber would normally be dealt with swiftly, but our forces are needed elsewhere.This task seems suited to you, Wakener. You will convince them to leave this land, or you will destroy them in the name of the Klaxxi'va.31732I will NOT let the Horde gain a foothold on these shores before we do! If you're looking to jump into the fray, I've got a spare gyrocopter for you at the end of the runway. An attack run is already programmed in, all you have to do is concentrate on shooting.Unleash hell upon these orcs!31733Their town is burning and their men are scattered and broken. I need every available man on the ground NOW to finish them off.Grab one of the parachutes on the edge of the ship and get down there!31734Did you see the size of those war wagons? They're packing so many explosives, I cannae tell if the Horde is here to take over this continent or just blow it out of the sea!We need to neutralize those wagons before they leave Garrosh'ar Point.Here, take me pocket flares. Fire 'em into a wagon and watch the fireworks!31735I've scouted the area and found no leads on the prince or Admiral Taylor. We need to neutralize this base quickly and continue our search elsewhere.Operations here are being led by an orc warlock; Ga'trul. He's barricaded the dock and is trying to escape through a demonic circle.Put that flaregun to work again and blow those barricades! I'll cover your back and move in when you reach Ga'trul.31736North of this base is a cherry blossom orchard and a village tucked away behind it. We will need to quarter there and tend to our wounded while we plan our next move.Head to that village and make contact with the native leader. Agent Mishka and I will rendezvous with you there.Be courteous, ! I am authorizing you to represent the entire Alliance here.I'm banking that seeing a powerful Alliance hero like you should make a favorable impression.31737This whole place is going up in flames and the Skyfire is reporting that more of those... shadows are crawling up out of the ground. We need to get our people out of here.Clear a path through the base on your way north and head for the town. I will rendezvous with you there.31738How did my village become a battlefield?To the west, your Horde enemies cut down our precious orchard. Without our apple trees, we will have no harvest, no food, and no livelihood.If you are truly different than this Horde, show us! Help us protect our grove by killing those who defile the land.31739Those \"orc\" things ransacked the brewery and made off with my family's finest barrels of cider.I know there is a war out there, but I am not a brewer who will stand idly by while his prized vintage is chugged by undeserving lips.The \"Horde\" will likely put up some resistance. Why don't you put that weapon to good use and help me recover my cider?31740We have more than just our cellars to worry about.Koukou, our beloved mushan, has gone crazy! Just look at him!I've tried cajoling and pleading and yelling and soothing, but nothing has worked.I'm afraid he is no longer of his own mind. There is only one way to save him, and our brewery.Strike swift and sure. He will not feel a thing.31741I do not trust this Horde. They wield foul magic, and their intentions are clearly malevolent. We can no longer stand their presence in Twinspire Keep, so close to Paw'don.I beg you, visitor: thin their numbers before they do something awful to this village.31742The Horde have made our jobs easier for us. Their infighting and segregation have split their camp in two: orcs in the west, and undead in the east.The orcs obey their commander Dalgan, while the undead follow Bellandra Felstorm, a powerful warlock. Hopefully, their internal squabbles will be enough of a distraction that you'll be able to sneak in there and kill both of them. Sully has already infiltrated the ruins; find him inside when you are done.31743Sully scouted the Horde establishment to the north, and he reports seeing a large pile of explosives, along with a small force of demolishers. That's not to mention the demons that their warlocks have summoned.Luckily, we came prepared. We've got air support from the Skyfire. We just need to show our pilots where to strike.31744Though we have only just met, we have a common enemy: this group called the \"Horde.\"Several days ago, their leader made us a trade offer. When we refused, his servants abducted several of our cubs as bargaining chips.We have called in the Shado-Pan to help, but they are in Kun-Lai Summit, a journey of several days. Can you come to our aid?31745\"Sha\" energy, hm? Tread carefully,  - there's a hidden darkness to this continent.We'll stay behind to mop up the rest of the Horde, but we need you to continue with the main mission: the rescue of Captain Taylor, and the retrieval of Prince Anduin.Our aerial scouts think we've found the wreckage of the flagship near Paw'don Village. Go there and report to Admiral Rogers for instructions.You are welcome to use my gyrocopter.3175231765They shot out our engines and we floated here - HERE! Right in the firing line of the enemy!You know what to do, . Get below decks and man those guns!Show these scum that they're in OUR line of fire!31766Nazgrim has taken command of the ground assault and has requested that you be sent to meet up with him immediately.We have several rappelling ropes setup near the guns. Fastest way down you're going to find, save the one that ends poorly.31767We've softened them up. Now it's time to finish them off!That fortress must be cleansed of Alliance, and we've got nowhere to keep any prisoners.You know what to do, . The cowards will run if you give them the chance.See that you don't!31768It's not enough that we destroy their forces. Nothing must be left for them to salvage!Take this flare-gun and fire it into their munitions stockpiles. Leave them nothing!31769We've learned that their captain has barricaded himself in above us.The coward allowed his forces to die while he hid from our fury! Typical Alliance! No matter. He cannot delay his fate any longer.I will scale the walls with my marines while you lead a frontal assault up the ramps. Use your flare gun on munitions near the barricades to blast your way through.We will meet you up top and destroy this pathetic excuse for a captain together!31770The assistance of the nearby village has now become a necessity, $p.We will need to use the village to regroup and tend to our wounded.Perhaps the villagers will join our cause after seeing the brutality unleashed by the alliance.You will act as envoy for the Horde. Ensure the cooperation of their leader. Do not disappoint me!31771I do not know the history of this war that you fight, and I am not interested. This land responds to negative energy in kind. The hatreds, doubt, and violence you have brought here now ooze out of Pandaria like blood from an open wound.Your actions have wrought havoc all over these ruins! Clean up after yourself and meet me in the village below - I will do my best to explain what is happening here.31772Just look at this mess! All that brew gone to waste!Taran Zhu warned us against speaking to you outsiders, but I'll take any help I can get.We were on our way to Dawn's Blossom when the fighting broke out. Now all of our brew has been lost!You want to make it up to us? Maybe you can find some of our Honeybrew barrels that haven't been broken. Then it wouldn't be a complete loss.31773The animals have all gone crazy!Normally the prowlers steer clear of the village, but now we can't seem to keep them away. I've never seen them act this way before!The mayor has summoned in the Shado-Pan, but they're not all here yet. Can you take care of those prowlers before they maul one of our farmers?31774Rivett claims to have seen Zin'jun abandon ship with the rest of the survivors. That means he's still out there somewhere.We can't leave him behind. He could be injured or worse yet, captured!Go track down Zin'jun and bring him back.31775I have found their hidden airfield, : the Strongarm Airstrip. It wasn't hard to spot, it's swarming with Alliance.They think they've wiped us out, but we're Horde! We fight until we're corpses... and sometimes even afterwards. Let them taste our steel!31776Scouting reports from the Strongarm Airstrip are in, and I've underlined a few high-priority targets for you.Two gnomish mechanics have been keeping Alliance gyrocopters in the air. Take out the mechanics, and the gyrocopters' numbers will dwindle.A dwarven death knight wanders their perimeter. He's an adventurer like yourself - loosely allied and highly dangerous.Finally, a name I recognize: Corporal Jackson Silver. He's a hero of the Alliance and a deadshot with a crossbow.Good luck, .31777I spotted some shoulder-mounted rocket launchers on the way over here.They mighta been fireworks. I dunno. I'm just going to assume that they were shoulder-mounted rocket launchers until I'm proven wrong.Point is, in the arms of a skilled  like you, they could probably take down a chopper. If you find any lying around, try pointing them at those poorly-built gyrocopters.31778We originally welcomed the Alliance as friends. Several of our villagers volunteered to help them build an airstrip. Only recently, however, did it become clear to us that they were building a war base, within shouting distance of our village.What's worse - I fear that some villagers are being held against their will. If you find them, , let them know that it is time to come home.31779You didn't see Captain Doren while you were out there, did you?That sniveling Alliance leader must be in hiding somewhere. If he wasn't in that airbase, he can't be far. Search the perimeter - try searching the cave southwest of the main airfield. I want the Alliance gone from here!31780I won't be such a pushover this time around!31781Think you can take me again?  I'm always up for challenge!31782The council is in harmony, wakener.Our ritual will bring about the demise of the empress and allow us to secure the future of our great empire.Behold the power of the Klaxxi!3178431785Good, good.

Our fleet is waiting.32109For too long the Horde has been allowed to run rampant across Azeroth. I will not see these new lands conquered by some barbaric \"warchief.\"Are you ready to bring Alliance justice to the shores of Pandaria?Let us return to the landing site. Use the flare launcher to bring in the fleet proper, and begin Operation: Shieldwall.321123211332115The mogu are a bunch of right bastards!They enslaved the pandaren who worked these caves even after their death. Ye' gotta go free their spirits! It's just not right.Be careful though... so much trauma, they don't know what's a friend and what's an enemy. So they'll probably fight back.32116When I ordered the excavation of the tunnel to the northwest, I thought we'd find something useful. Gold, iron... anything!Instead, we found mogu artifacts, and I get a bunch of dwarves from the Explorers' League to baby-sit.I hear from the soldiers that there's trouble in the mines. I have orders from Wrynn that I have to support the Explorers' League, but I can't spare any troops. Can you get down there and find out what's going on?32118The fools in the Explorers' League have excavated an ancient mogu ruin to the northeast. And - of course - in their bumbling, they've disturbed the mogu spirits within.We are going to take advantage of their ineptitude. Take this portal and meet with Kaelis Sunsoar, my contact within the ruins.32119There's somethin' down there that was spookin' the workers. Some kind o' anomaly... looks like a ghost, or a magic spell... like nothing I've ever seen.I did manage to get a reading on it and put together this device to try to track it down. The display on the device will let you know roughly how close you are. Once you get close enough, you can use it to draw out the anomaly and get rid of it for good!32120The ruins which we are occupying were built by Ogudei - an ancient mogu ruler. We know little about who he was, though the rise of the spirits in this area seems to indicate that it was related to spirit binding.When you destroy these spirits, a small amount of their essence will remain in this world. Bring it to us - we will analyze it and hopefully learn more about Ogudei's history - and his power.32121In the ruins there are a bunch of right nasty blue crystals. Look at 'em the wrong way and bloody angry ghosts run out at ya.I'm gonna be needing ye' to go in and clear some of them out so we can get our people back to work.32122When we dug through to an ancient section of the mogu ruins, that's when all this nasty business went down - and that's where the two worst o' these ghosties emerged.We need them gone, friend.32123The Alliance has made landfall. If we do not defeat them here, any hope of a Horde presence on this continent is lost.Go to the battlefield south of here and slay Alliance you find.Show them how any Horde who still stands on two legs will be the death of ten Alliance!32126The Alliance may be cowardly, but they are not fools. Their assault would be formidable, if it were directed at lesser creatures.To sustain a siege and put pressure on our troops they are air dropping in supplies to support their ground forces.Search the beaches and docks to the south for any airdropped supplies and smash them.Let the Alliance see their food and ammunition destroyed before their eyes and despair.32127Our Warchief has dispatched me to these shores to deal with this pitiful Alliance threat.These humans and their allies have proven to be very dependent on their leaders. No initiative of their own.As you walk the battlefield today look to the Alliance ships off our southern shores. Find their captains.Slay them.For the Horde!32128The Alliance have planted themselves off our southern coast and continue to pepper our ground forces with cannon fire. Let us see how great their siege is without such support.Board the enemy vessels and destroy their reserve ammunition. This will take the teeth out of their bite.32130I've got some customers lined up that wanna collect some good old fashioned ears. But not any old ears. They only want the absolute waxiest ears money can buy! Guess they think they're lucky or something'.Anyways, I need you to go get 'em for me. I don't want to hurt any animals, so you'll need to get 'em from the Alliance over at Lion's Landing.Have fun - and remember, only bring me the waxiest!32131Gnomes are excavating a stone quarry to the northeast.They're building stuff with it!They're too stupid to realize it's special mogu stone for creating animated statues. WE can mix with a little Goblin magic juice to make some real big explosions!But the stuff is heavy. They've got some of their stupid bomb-bots there for excavating the stone. Blow 'em up near slabs and you'll get chunks small enough to carry. Or, just kill 'em and take it. Whatever works.32132Our goblin friends do not have the grasp of strategy necessary to win a long term engagement, I'm afraid.The key to eliminating any permanent establishment is to attack their ability to replenish their troops and to rebuild.In this case, that means taking out their Peasants. Kill them, and you weaken the foundation. The rest of the keep is bound to crumble.32133We've spotted heavy air support over their base, in the form of way too many dwarves on way too many griffons. Means we can't get any vision of the area from above.A troll... friend of mine gave us a set of Sentry Wards, which we can use to spy on their base and get a vantage point on what's going on in there.Bad news, friend - you're going to be the one going in there.32134We've managed to get some Demolishers on the beach, but the stupid dwarves are also out there with their stupid mortar tubes, preventing the Demolishers from pushing forward and assaulting the keep itself!Get out there, kill some dwarves, and blow up some mortar tubes.32135There are some situations in which taking out one of their soldiers is more important than killing hundreds.They've deployed some of their heroes to the battlefield to help rally their defenders. Not only will killing them soften their defense, it will also leave their morale crippled.So go, take one down for me. You can handle it.32136Our fuel supplies are running low. Without fuel we won't be able to operate the machinery that's building this place. They might even expect me to start helping them build!I was not built for manual labor! See these nails?! I just had them done!Get down to the refinery and get this fuel order filled! Hurry! They were fitting me for a tool-belt this morning. It didn't even match my outfit!32137I've never seen this quality of oil! Problem is the oil needed a little extra refinin'.I heard of this system where you use ocean water to speed up the process. I don't have time to waste down here, so I just threw the barrels into the bay.Pretty good idea, I know. Problem is, I'm not sure how to pull it out of the bay...Maybe someone of your expertise could help me out.32138Everyday it's the same thing! \"We're out of this!\", \"We need more of that!\", \"Why don't you ever do anything?!\"I work! I do things! They can be so hurtful! I'm doin' my best down here!Oh yeah, we need more lumber! Go down and tell that good for nothin' Zino to get his shredders in gear!32139We just filled an order this morning. How could they possibly need more already?!My team has been workin' double-time to get these trees chopped and processed.Problem is we have an infestation of Lion's Landing troops down here. I already risked my neck once today, I'm not goin' back out there!Goob will go with you and help you fill this order. He's not the brightest, but he can do the heavy liftin'.32140When they said they found some amazing rocks in that mine I envisioned diamonds. Everyone knows all mines have diamonds, silly! At the very least rubies!Instead, all I got was this strange iron! What am I supposed to do with this?Oh well, no one said this job would be glamorous. I just do what I can to add a little class.We just got another work order for iron. Go see Daxil down near Oregrind's Dig and get it filled pronto!32141Sometimes we dig too deep, . Sometimes, we uncover something so horrible we wish we hadn't started diggin'...Just kidding! I mean, don't get me wrong, we did find something unexpected. The ore we're finding down there is not your average run-of-the-mill iron.There is just one problem; Shale Spiders! We're struggling to keep these orders filled.Maybe you can lend us a hand?32142The orcs can NOT be allowed a foothold in this land. They will defile it just as they did Kalimdor.$p, I need boots on the ground and horde in their graves. Get down to the coastline and bring the full force of Alliance wrath down on their heads!Slay any orcs you find. Take the wind out of their sails.For the King!32143Greetings $p! I have heard a lot about your success in the field. I would like to use your services to test my latest \"Siege-o-Matic\", a device of terrible and varied abilities.I promise it is mostly harmless to its users.When you are around Domination Point be on the look out for my Scout-o-Meters. They have been dispatched to get info on good siege targets. When you find one, activate it and I will pilot a Siege-o-Matic to your location.See you in the field... as it were.32144The Horde are consumed by pride and will fight to the death without a second thought.We need to find a way to break their will that does not involve massive loss of our numbers.Look for the Horde supplies along the coastline and near their ships. Smash their supplies.Nothing breaks the will of a defender like seeing their hope of food go up in a puff of smoke.When you are done, find Sully behind enemy lines. He has the next task for you.32145My probes have detected three very dangerous targets in the courtyard of Domination Keep.They have an ogre emissary, a Kor'kron officer, and an insane goblin bomb maker.My siege-o-matics are not ready for one on one combat so it is up to you to eliminate the targets.Good luck! Report back to me on the Skyfire when done.32146It looks like the Horde thinks they can hide behind their heavy hitting mooks.The mooks are tough, powerful, and dumber than an ogre with a hangover.Go down there and bring the hammer of the Alliance fury down on them!3214732148Sure, they've got about plenty of grunts out there, pounding on our door, waiting to cut our heads off.I'm not worried about grunts. But they've got shamans and raiders, too. The shamans use their magic to empower the grunts, and the raiders are fast and specialize in taking out our buildings.I need you to get out there and kill some of those shamans and raiders.Go! Attack! Move!32149Oh, the poor peasants...They are cowards, yes, of course. But they don't know how to fight, and they go out to collect lumber for our efforts... the Horde targets them... It's just awful all around!But, we need that lumber if we're going to hold out. Go out and collect any they've dropped.32150The Horde decided to put goblins in charge of their logistics. And where you have goblins, you have carelessly placed explosives.Scouts have reported that they have their supplies in carts that also contain demolisher ammunition. Look at those crates the wrong way, and they'll blow sky high. With enough Horde resources destroyed, we'll put a time limit on their attack and save lives. So go and take out those carts!32151The gnomes are running our quarry operation to the northwest. The stone there is especially tough - the gnomes tell me the mogu used it to fashion their constructs. I don't know. What I do know is that we use that stone to build our towers, and the Horde has dispatched the Bilgewater goblins to steal it from us.Get out there and get some back. By the way - collateral damage may break up the stone slabs there. If so, pick that up, too.32152The Horde got the bright idea to send Bilgewater goblins to attack our quarry.They've been packing heavy explosives - heavy explosives that will react with the ammunition in their demolishers.Kill the Bilgewater goblins until you find an explosive, plant it on one of the demolishers... and BOOM! Siege ended.32153Look, you're tough. Tougher than the rest of the men and women I've got here. Which means I need you for a special mission.The Horde is throwing their best against us. Heroes of their armies - Blademasters, Tauren Chieftans, you name it.I need you to go take one out. It'll be a huge blow, not just to their offensive but also to morale.32154Those goblins are gettin' out of hand! First they level the forest and set up that abomination of a rig. Then, they start dumpin' their oil barrels into the bay!We got to put a stop to this madness! At the very least we need ta set them back.We need to take out their fuel supply! Maybe you'll even get to kill a few goblins in the process!32155It goes against me nature to break things on purpose, but in this case it's necessary.That rig the goblins are usin' is held together by a wish an' some bubblegum. We need to exploit the situation a little more.We have some saboteurs down there already, but we can use someone of your expertise to hurry the job along.Get down there an' start breakin' and stealin' some valves!32156This is barbaric warfare, ! We've lost so many trying to keep the Bilgewater operation from spreading any further.Those fallen soldiers fought honorably and deserved to be given their last rights. At the very least we need to be able to notify their next of kin.Perhaps you can collect their identification tags so we can honor them in some small way.32157The destruction in Krasarang is unforgivable, . The only way to put an end to this is to destroy the Bilgewater operation.This is for the greater good of Pandaria and the Alliance. Go to Bilgewater Beach and cut them down! No doubt the Horde will come to their assistance.Destroy them!32158Shredmaster Packle is responsible for much of the devastation down there, .Rumor has it he modified the shredders to work more quickly with less regard for the collateral damage they can inflict.Imagine the agony the trees must endure being hacked at. It will be difficult to recover from this level of destruction.The first step in any recovery is acknowledging the problem. Step two is eliminating that problem.32159We should attempt to offset the destruction being wrought on this continent as much as possible. For every tree they destroy, we will plant a new one!Take these seeds and begin the regrowth process, .Do not linger for too long though. Nature is unpredictable, and no doubt the anger and hate exuding from Domination Point has seeped into the ground.I cannot guarantee that the plant that springs from these seeds will not be hostile.32161Along with the snare, you get some advice on crane hunting:The greatest cranes of the Krasarang Wilds are not tempted by simple things like food. You will need to play on the creatures' emotions if you wish to draw them from their hiding places in the jungle.Cranes abound on both the Cradle of Chi-ji and the Narsong Spires, both of which can be found east of here. Pluck those cranes' quills, then place them in a visible spot near the Crane Temple. Your quarry will come running to you.32162Along with the trap, you get some advice on tiger hunting:Tigers are gluttonous creatures, and large game is hard to come by in this jungle. If you wish to tempt the most elder cats out of their hiding places, you may do so with a meal.Just on the other side of the Serpent's Spine, you will find a herd of yaks. Slay them, bring their meat to the jungle's edge, set up your trap, and wait.32163Along with the crate, you get some advice on crab hunting:Crabs are strange, primordial creatures, with wildly different motivations than you or I.Small crabs are easy to find and hunt, but the large ones hide beneath the sands, out of danger and out of our reach. To draw them out, we play on their sense of smell.The Unga villagers to the southeast allow their fish to ferment before they eat them. Bring enough rotten fish together, and you will catch yourself a colossal crab.32164Along with the snare, you get some advice on crane hunting:The greatest cranes of the Krasarang Wilds don't care about simple things like food. You need to play on the creatures' emotions if you want to draw them out of the jungle.There's plenty of cranes on the Cradle of Chi-ji and on the Narsong Spires, both to the west of here. Pluck some of those cranes' quills, then put them in a visible spot near the Crane Temple. Your quarry will come running to you.32165Along with the trap, you get some advice on tiger hunting:Tigers are gluttons, and big game is hard to come by in this jungle. If you want to tempt the elder cats out of their hiding places, you need a tempting meal.Just on the other side of the Serpent's Spine, you can find a herd of yaks. Kill them, bring their meat to the jungle's edge, set up your trap, and wait.32166Along with the crate, you get some advice on crab hunting:Crabs are strange, old creatures, with different motivations than us.Small crabs are easy to find and hunt, but the big ones hide beneath the sands, out of danger and out of our reach. To draw them out, we play on their sense of smell.The Unga villagers to the southwest allow their fish to ferment before they eat them.

While we were busy defending our foothold here, Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron led a research expedition north into Kun-Lai Summit.Unfortunately, it seems they have encountered trouble.Warchief Garrosh Hellscream has already departed to lend his assistance, but he will require additional reinforcements.Go northward into the mountains of Kun-Lai. Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.32191Before the mogu overwhelmed our scouting party, we found relics scattered amongst the ruins to the north.I would like to collect some samples, but the mogu's terracotta watchdogs are too much for us to handle.If you could clear the area of their presence, we will be able to resume our work.32192We managed to fend off the mogu wardens and their dogs, but many of the blood elves from the scouting party were not as lucky.Many of my people are trapped inside the ruins to the north. We are devising a solution to break them out, but I believe there may be a more straightforward approach.Go to the ruins and kill the wardens guarding each prisoner. If my intuition is correct, this will free our comrades.32193The Explorer's League sent an expedition north some days ago.We haven't heard from them since, and I'd sleep better at night knowing our folks aren't in some sort of trouble.Last I heard, Brann Bronzebeard was heading toward Mogujia in the Kun-Lai Summit.Find him and report back with their status. Fennie over there can give you a ride if you need one.32194The Explorer's League is here to excavate the ruins, and it's my job to protect them.When we arrived, we found this place crawling with blood elves. Apparently,the Horde are just as interested in the mogu as we are.This gives quite an opportunity to thin our enemies' numbers, and steal their findings, too.Slay any blood elves you find in the ruins, and bring back whatever they are digging up.32197We've been gettin' complaints right and left that the Boss-Lady gets all the good grub and leaves the scraps for the others.Between you and I, they may be onto somethin' here.

It's not uncommon for a classy person, such as her loveliness, to want crab for dinner. What did you think I meant?There are some big crabs wandering around on Bilgewater Beach that should be suitable for her refined palate.Bring Sezik the best crab meat you can find!32200, what I ask of you is little short of genocide, but it is a task that must be done.Find trolls within their town or on the beach and slay them, for the good of us all.32201The Court of Bones crawls with mogu forces. Endlessly do they perform their rituals of lightning and thunder.If our mission to take this island is to succeed, then we cannot allow them to hold such a strategic position.They must be eliminated.32204Ihgaluk Crag has no end of saurok.

Once the Horde takes full control of this island, we can look for more permanent solutions.32206The Zandalari here are very powerful, . They should not be underestimated. We cannot afford to ignore them as a threat simply because they do not wield swords.More arrive every day, and with them centuries of magic knowledge. This threat must be dealt with, and quickly.Aid us in clearing this area, . Perhaps we can even learn something from them in the process.32207Inside the Beast Pens you will encounter some of the most skilled beast tamers in the Zandalari military. They are trained to kill with axe, beast, and claw. This is where they build their cavalry.We need you to kill any Zandalari you find in there before they can get their mounted monstrosities out into the open battlefield.32208The mines north of here are being used to extract Ghost Iron ore and energize it with lightning energy.We need to destroy the drills they use to extract the ore. They are impervious to normal attack, but can be overloaded using the proper methods.Oh - and while you're there, take out whoever is running the operation.32209The heavy mogu presence in the mines let us know it was a place of great importance - but we needed to gather more information on their activities there, so we sent agents into the mines to spy on them.Unfortunately, many were captured, and we've found that some are being tortured in the mines. You have to go rescue them - nobody deserves what they are going through...And, when you finish, kill whoever captured them. No mercy, $p!32212Our scouting efforts along the coast have given us valuable intelligence about the island, .However, we will accomplish nothing if we do not advance forward onto the mainland.I have assembled a team of our most elite aerial units to begin the attack.I would like you to join the assault. A champion such as yourself could turn the battle in our favor at the critical moment.When you are ready to begin the attack, speak to me.32213So Jaina and the Kirin Tor think they can push us out again? I will not stand by and allow them to repeat the events of Dalaran!This time we fight back! This time we do the pushing...Go to Violet Rise and slay any Kirin Tor agent you find.32214There is nothing more unnerving than walking along, minding your own business, and hearing someone following you. I swear I hear it all over the place down here! We're being watched!I have a feeling the entire beach is just crawling with spies!I made some improvements to our infrared goggle tech to put an end to the sabotogery. That's right sabotogery! Now I just need you to try 'em out! Feel free to dispose of any spies you happen to catch.32215The Zandalari perform heinous rites against our people!

These dark rituals involve the sacrifice of our people.Destroy any offerings you can find among their tents in Za'Tual and perhaps we can stall the sacrifices.32218The mogu here at the Court of Bones are bolstering their army by resurrecting the spirits of their dead.We cannot allow them to revive their fallen warriors.Take this torch and burn any mummified corpses that you can find.We will destroy our enemies before they have a chance to rise.32219Our assault on the Court of Bones continues. Our progress remains slow, but measurable.Unfortunately, we've received several reports of stone quilen statues coming to life without warning. I can't have these quilen threatening my research expedition.Venture into the Court of Bones and destroy any quilen statues that you can find.32220We assault the mogu at the Court of Bones, but I fear we merely send them fodder for their abominable rituals.The mogu do not merely kill their prisoners - they steal their souls and imbue them in machinations of stone, or reforge the fallen into ghostly tools of war.Horde or Alliance, it matters not. We cannot allow the mogu to bolster their numbers.Go into the crypts. Free any prisoners that are still living.32221Our lumber supply is being jeopardized by constant attacks from Lion's Landing.We've been able to keep the attackers at bay, but it's time to really show 'em some muscle!Head down to the coast and start splitting some skulls!32222Wanted for crimes against the Bilgewater Operation!Chief Engineer Cogwrench was last seen building what appeared to be a giant spider tank on the edge of Bilgewater Beach.Extreme caution should be used when approaching.A large reward has been posted for Cogwrench's destruction.32223Wanted for crimes against the Domination Point forces!Lieutenant Ethan Jacobson is responsible for leading several ground assaults against the Bilgewater lumber operation.Last spotted occupying an island south of Quickchop's Lumber Farm.32224Have you seen the ghosts wandering the graveyard?They are risen ancestors, the spirits of slain mogu who have been called back to this world.When angered, they attack swiftly and silently, and their numbers increase by the day.They do not belong here. Destroy them, and send them back beyond the grave.32225Within the graveyard, in the deepest ruins of their western crypt, the Thunder King's most powerful sorcerers are charging a lightning rod with crackling electricity.We suspect that this weapon is meant to rain destruction on our stronghold at Dawnseeker Promontory.There is no time to delay. You must stop their ritual at once.32226The Reliquary is having a field day out here, literally!Every day, the researchers find more relics to study and catalog.Recently, one of our adventurers found this scroll at the Court of Bones.I believe that this incantation can be used to call beyond the grave. And if my Mogu is up to date, I'd say you should use it in the last room in the Hall of the Exalted.Would you be willing to test out my theory?32227The creatures the Zandalari ride don't start out so big, nor do they start out the vicious and loyal creatures they become.If you can frighten some of the hatchling skyscreamers away from the beach, perhaps they will have a chance at a real life.32228There is an immense beast in the swamp. It has not yet marched upon us, but I place no stock that we will continue to be so fortunate.Strike it down before it grows hungry enough to brave our defenses.32230The trolls have dispatched one of their immense constructs on the southern road, blocking our passage around the island. See to it that the road is cleared, .32232I noticed something strange on my last scouting mission. A group of Zandalari are performing a ritual on what appears to be a very large sentry. They may be trying to re-animate it.We need that ritual stopped and the sentry destroyed. Anything that large can't be good.I've sent a scout ahead to observe their actions. Meet with her and figure out how to stop them.32233Look around you, . What do you see? I see an opportunity.The casters here work to imbue the Zandalari weapons with powerful magic. As if a sharp blade isn't enough to cut even the strongest foe down to size.In my scouting I've noticed the weapons are not very well guarded. This is where you come in...If we can steal a few of these weapons we may be able to use them. At the very least they are out of enemy hands.32234The Zandalari here practice a different kind of magic. We must understand it before we can defeat it, .Their control over the arcane and shadow is impressive. I wish to learn how they have achieved what so many others have not.I believe their ritual artifacts may hold the answers I seek. Bring me a sampling of the artifacts you find, and I will ensure you are rewarded properly.32235The gnomes have brought their flying contraptions. I want my skies CLEAR!Get up there on whatever mount you have with you and destroy those paltry devices.You may use this grog I \"acquired\" from our goblin allies. It would be better served blasting down gyrocopters than in the gullet of those little green fiends.32236This cave is crawlin' with nasty shale spiders! How's a girl supposed to get any work done with them gobbling up the miners AND the ore?!This seemed like a good opportunity to use my newest invention, Bug Off. See, all you have to do is spray this stuff all over the shale spiders. They hate it and it doesn't seem to have many long term side-effects for the miners!What could possibly go wrong?Take this handy sprayer and get to work!32237What we have here is too much of a good thing, !Our rig just can't handle the amount of oil we're pumping out of the ground. It's literally bursting at the seams! To be more accurate, it's bursting at the valves.I've been working double-time to get the valves repaired, but every time I finish the rounds, they're all broken again.It's as if someone is following me... That's ridiculous though....Maybe you'll have better luck. Try getting as many of those valves tightened as you can.32238The Mecha-Pounders are really making things difficult down here, but I think I may have the solution!I made this universal remote for myself, but it looks like I hit a specific frequency that has an useful result!Apparently this frequency weakens their armor!Use the remote to take them down a few notches then punch 'em in the face!32242I am told that the mogu once possessed hundreds of hidden armories full of earth-shattering weapons.When a mogu army prepared for war, they struck fear and terror into the hearts of their enemies.THIS is the knowledge I seek here on Pandaria!I have sent an expedition to study some ruins to the west, but they work as slowly as dim-witted peons!Go speak to Fanlyr Silverthorn, their leader. Tell him that I want to see results immediately.32243Why hullo there! Have ya ever seen tha like o' these statues? Fascinatin'!I was scouting up along the ruins earlier, and I spotted somethin' innerestin' up on the highest rise.I couldn't get close enough, but I think it might be one o' these mogu statues, 'cept it was movin'!I can't get through all those nasty blood elves, but you look like you could.Would you mind going up there and bringing me back anything of interest?32244These terracotta wardens are fearsome, but not nearly as horrifying as the creature that we found at the top of the ruins.Some of our surviving scouts reported seeing some kind of mogu spellweaver on the highest rise to the north.He practices a type of magic unlike any other we have seen.We must learn whatever we can from this creature.

I need you to find them and see if they need any supplies or assistance.They will be concealed from view. Look for shimmering columns of light within the saurok village.32255Saurok consistently test our borders, and our constructs usually fend them off. Some constructs, however, have been defeated and dragged back to Ihgaluk Crag.I want those constructs back. No slithering lizard will steal Sunreaver property under my watch.32256Warchief Garrosh Hellscream travels north with a squad of his most elite soldiers.Report to him with news of our continued victory against the Alliance.Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.32257Too slowly!?

He must understand!Well, we may have something to show him soon. Do you see that stone statue to the west?We suspect it is an ancient stone storage vessel. Now we just have to find a way to open it.If you would care to help us with our excavation, please go about it carefully.32262The Kirin Tor have gone too far! Now they hold our fellow Sunreavers as war prisoners!There will be no discussion of prisoner exchange. We will handle this ourselves.Go to Violet Rise and free as many prisoners as you can. Do not get captured yourself. We cannot afford to lose you too.32264Jaina possesses several very powerful magic artifacts. These items travel with her at all times, and are never far from her grasp. I have an interest in one of these items.A tome, filled with knowledge, passed from one archmage to another. I have only ever seen glimpses of it.Now that we fight on opposite sides I see no issue in removing the tome from her possession.32265We have been dispatching spies into the Kirin Tor base of operations on a daily basis. Some had orders to recover charged moganite from the enemy and bring it here.They have not returned, and I can confirm they have left the Kirin Tor base.Search the jungle between here and there and find any of the charged moganite that might have been lost in transit. Bring it to me and we will put it to good use.32266Manafiends are nasty creatures. Small and easy to underestimate, but deadly to our magic casters. The Kirin Tor have these pests crawling all over Violet Rise.We will need to handle them carefully. Alone they are easily managed, but in groups they become a different challenge altogether.Go to Violet Rise and cut down their numbers.32268Ah, $p, just the  I was looking for. I have received another batch of tactical mana bombs that I need planted in key positions across Violet Rise to the southeast.Here, take these. I do not trust our standard soldiers with such firepower. Oh... and don't shake them, whatever you do.Plant one of the Kirin Tor ships, another one near their supplies, and the last on the construct they are building.32269We need to keep a close watch on the Kirin Tor and their day-to-day activities. Normally this would be easy. We would sneak in a spy and have them report back to us.However, we've run into a slight problem I believe you can help us with.The Kirin Tor perimeter wards have increased in power. It's next to impossible to get someone past their lines. If they were disabled we might be able to sneak in before they can be repaired.32274The Skumblade threaten our people, but responding with all-out slaughter would be an overreaction.A more reasonable response to their threat would be to slay some of their tribal leaders. There will be less bloodshed, and they will still respect our perimeter.32276The time has come. Our forces are well-enough entrenched here that we can risk pressing forward, into the Thunder King's lair. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like he'll be opening that gate anytime soon.I suppose we'll have to make a gate of our own then. Let me know when you're ready, .32278Zandalari warships plunder the seas around this island. They ferry in soldiers and war beasts from Zandalar to bolster Lei Shen's army.If we can capture the palace shipyard, the Thunder King's supply line will be cut off, and your foothold here will be secure.I have a plan to do just that, and it won't take an entire army.32279Long ago, Lei Shen found a rare clutch of storm dragon eggs.

They are superb hunting beasts that can track prey over great distances and are often lethal to encounter when caught unawares.I need you to head into the Beast Pens and cull their numbers. We need to make sure to slay them before they are fully trained.32283The Zandalari have found a way to bind loa to their beasts giving them impressive and lethal powers.We need to put a stop to this.Search the Beast Pens for a loa speaker and slay him. You should be able to find them by keeping a look out for their glowing beasts.We must not allow these atrocities to continue.32284$p?

Destroy any of the walking statues you see. Our defenders will greatly appreciate it.32287There are mogu in the Diremoor animating the army of statues near the tower. Lor'themar wants them dead. I think you're the one to do it.32288This island holds many dangers for us. Threats loom from every side. We must defend our hold on these shores at all costs.Perimeter wards have been placed around Dawnseeker Promontory. By default they will inflict damage, but are not fatal in their attack.Now is not the time to be merciful, . The perimeter wards need to be deadly!Go and empower the perimeter wards surrounding our camp.32292The forge lies ahead of you, and with it the heart of the mogu's weaponsmithing ability.And beyond that, the mogu gatekeeper, who holds the key to unlocking the gate to the next part of the city.It's time to move out!32293My scouts have spotted a dangerous Zandalari among the bones west of Ihgaluk Crag. I need someone capable to see him dispatched. Are you up to the task?32295The tome appears to be written in an ornate, sprawling script that seems to rise off the pages. It vaguely resembles Demonic, but the symbols are far more elaborate than any you've ever seen.Perhaps one of your demonic companions can tell you more.32297We have an opportunity to disrupt the Zandalari war machine as well as have a little fun in the process.Within these beast pens, a devilsaur and a direhorn are being outfitted with armor, their minds being enslaved to the Zandalari charms.Go into the camp and disrupt one of these binding rituals. It doesn't matter which one. Just kill those who are trying to bind the creature. This should let the fully armored beast run mad through the Zandalari camp. Then sit back and watch the hilarity ensue.32298The Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts.Two can play at that game.I want you to find some of these fetishes and try them out on the various beasts in the Beast Pens.Take careful note of how each beast responds to each fetish. Then report your results to me.Maybe this will give us the edge we need against the Zandalari.32299This is not a glamorous job. Let me put it to you bluntly.The Skumblade saurok pile all of their filth into a pool in the middle of their village. This filth is so concentrated and so rancid that it has congealed into moving, animate matter.The saurok can keep their filth-pool, but once it starts spreading outside of the village, I'd say it's time to intervene.32300Well, it would seem the Lady Proudmoore has decided to use our own weaponry against us. Our perimeter wards reported several spies slipping through our defenses carrying tactical mana bombs.I would enjoy the irony if these bombs were less dangerous.Search for these bombs and disarm them. Our wards reported one near the horde ships to the north, one on a bridge to the main isle, and one near our scrying crystals on the eastern side of the Promontory.32301To think, we were once on the same side! The Sunreavers' treachery caught us all off guard. Never again!They have shown their true natures to us. Siding with Garrosh and his madness has marked them all for death.Kill any agent of the Sunreavers that you find. We will show them no mercy here.32302The Kirin Tor constructs are primitive at best. Nevertheless, they pose a threat.Go to Violet Rise and dismantle Jaina's pitiful war machines. Show the Kirin Tor how easily they can be defeated!This will be a message the Kirin Tor cannot easily ignore.32303Jaina thinks this battle will be easily won. I intend to show her how wrong she is!The Kirin Tor brought a weapon with them that must be destroyed. The Arcane Destroyer is a large construct capable of turning the tides of war in their favor.Destroying this monstrosity would send a very clear message to Proudmoore.32305The Kirin Tor are using mana foci to empower their forces. We cannot allow this to continue.You'll find these foci scattered around the outskirts of Violet Rise.

We must make sure that the Darkspear are safe.32321Ever since the Horde captured the Divine Bell I have been searching for a means to counter its power.My research got as far as this tomb.

Speak to me when you are ready to proceed.32324The soulstone shards fuse together easily in your hands.Strangely, no soul is stored within the stone. Instead, the stone seems to be drawing power from somewhere in Shadowmoon Valley. Looking east, you feel the power linked beyond the mountains, to the very gates of the Black Temple.32325It's clear that Jubeka's soulstone has lead you here to the Black Temple. The question remains... why?The only remaining option is to head inside and figure out why they were here.32326! You'll do perfectly.We know where the Alliance have hidden the Divine Bell. We've already inserted an agent into enemy territory, we just need you to help him execute his mission.Pack up, . You're headed to Darnassus.32327The Divine Bell is in the city. We don't want to cause a scene, we just want the artifact. I need you to find a way in, WITHOUT getting caught. That means no mounts, no flying, no fighting.I can provide aid. I will magically cloak you, so you may move with stealth. I will also give you a small charm that you may use to return to safety, should you get in trouble.Now go, . Go, locate the bell, and tag it to be teleported back with you.32328The portal by my side will return you safely to Domination Point.

The Warchief has instructed me to dispatch you to Silvermoon.He grows impatient with the progress of Lor'themar's research and feels they might benefit from your... unique... experiences with the mogu.Go to Silvermoon and demand that Lor'themar increase the speed of his research.32330We are trying to uncover the secrets of one of the mogu artifacts Garrosh insisted we investigate. It is proving most difficult, as anyone who probes it magically is greatly affected by raw, negative emotions.I called in the assistance of Arch-mage Aethas of the Sunreavers in the hopes that he and Rommath could crack this puzzle. They asked for you specifically - apparently you have some relevant experience?Go to the chamber below Farstrider Square east of here and see if you can assist them.32331$p, King Varian has asked that I send you after his son to Dalaran. He believes you can help negotiate the withdrawal of blood elves there.These \"Sunreavers\" claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort.Now that our very own Jaina Proudmoore is in charge of the Kirin Tor it should be easy to convince her to remove this Horde threat to her city.Use the portal here in Lion's Landing to go to the Purple Parlor and lend what aid you can to Prince Anduin.32332So, you wake up the Monkey King for a mallet hmmm? Answer first, these riddles three, and then the mallet you shall see.First riddle!  \"Softly singing a song of pain    There is a creature tortured and lame.    Way down south and beyond the wall,    It hides from its wikket masters' call.

We need to be friends first.You want to be friends? We need a Metal brew first. You want a Metal brew? You need to go to the Shrine of Fellowship first. You want to go to the Shrine of Fellowship? Great! It's in the Jade Forest southeast of the Tian Monastery.Ring the bell and get the Monkey King some brew while there. Oh... you may have to fight for it.32334The mallet you seek is not a toy for children,It calls trouble like the song of a siren.A test of strength the Monkey King will require,Before you receive this tool of your desire.At the Temple of the White Tiger you will findA challenger to test how well you are resignedStep through the main door and then turn right down the rampChallenge the ook waiting for you there like a champ!32335So riddles three you answered me. Good good. The Monkey King is not so old that he tells just anyone his tricks.It was the greatest prank ever!You want to hear story of the Mallet and the Monkey? Too bad! No choice!32336There once was a Chief named Ingoo Ingoo,Who beat me in a drink drink boogaloo.He took the mallet's handle for winning,Not knowing you can't beat the King in drinking.Monkey King had to hide the mallet from the bell,But Ingoo's children do not use the handle well.Over the years they have used the handle to do harm,Now we must find the current chief so we can disarm.Go south to Unga Ingoo, Monkey King meet you there.Only wikkets show to a party with hands bare.32337Monkey King receive word on where to find the head,The hozen who got it has long since been dead.

They trapped spirits within, probably to use them in some ritual or conjuration.They are a type of device that we haven't identified and desperately need to study - they may reveal more of the secrets of the mogu's spirit binding techniques. Go, find us a few samples so that we may continue a proper study.32343There are two extremely powerful mogu spirits that the Alliance unearthed in their ineptitude.These are choice targets for us, . If you kill them and collect each of their essences, we could make great progress on decoding the history of this strange ruin.32344We have detected several... anomalies in these mines, of an arcane or spiritual nature. They are disrupting our attempts to discern the nature of the magic used in the spirit binding rituals here.They are quite elusive, but we've managed to isolate the arcane signature of one of these anomalies, and one of our mages has enchanted this bauble with its signature.Take the bauble. It will begin to glow more brightly as you approach the anomaly. Once you reach it, you can use the bauble to draw it out.32345The Reliquary may have had a bad name in the past, but we're not monsters. We simply hold different views about archaeology than the Explorer's League.We do focus on performing acts of heroism from time to time. So go, liberate some of the pandaren slave spirits in the ruins.32346Look. We got a nasty problem here, and ol' Troteman back at Lion's Landing's gonna throw us out of here if we don't get things under control.Give us a hand, please!32347The bloody Reliquary's snuck into the ruins. They've taken the lower section and are conducting all kinds of magical shenanigans down there.It's time we gave 'em an eviction notice, in the form of your boot in their rear!32348The Alliance may think they have a stranglehold on the ruins, given that their base of operations is close.We're going to disabuse them of that notion. Go take out some of their guards.32351Ah, , we meet again. I have heard some wondrous news.High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof of the tauren has arrived here on Pandaria.He meets with Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron now, at the Shrine of Two Moons in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.He sent me a strange request - to send him a loyal champion of the Horde, capable of combat... and discretion.I can think of none better to send than you. Speak to Tak-Tak if you seek transport.32352If General Nazgrim sent you, then I trust you are capable of discretion.When I arrived here, I found Garrosh... experimenting... with some ancient power that he found in the mountains to the north.He believes that this \"sha\" can strengthen our soldiers.Unfortunately, so far the results have been quite the opposite.Our troops are erupting into random violence. Go and interrogate them. If they threaten you, be prepared to defend yourself.32355$p! Prince Anduin has somehow slipped his guards again. His control over the light is greatly increasing.He was last seen heading to Kun-Lai Summit. He gave our mages the slip around the Valley of Emperors.Can you find him? He insists on searching for what he claims is a counter to the Divine Bell. Perhaps you can talk some sense into him before he seizes control of your mind and has you dance your way back here.Talk to Fennie for a ride into the mountains.32356It's time for Sully and I to leave. We'll keep our eyes out for any sign of the White Pawn and report back shortly.I'm afraid I must leave you in charge while Admiral Taylor is recovering. Learn as much as you can from these jinyu while we are away. I expect a full report when we return.3235832362Jaina is refusing to hear me out. Father was hoping I would have some pull with her, but I think she still sees me as a child.You, on the other hand, are a hero of the Alliance and I know she respects your deeds.Is there something you can say to her to convince her we need her help?32363I have another message for you from High Chieftain Bloodhoof.It seems you've made quite the impression on him.He travels with the Warchief's vanguard into Kun-Lai Summit, to the north. They have set up an outpost, Garrosh'ar Advance, just east of One Keg.You had best not keep him waiting. Speak to Tak-Tak for swift travel.32368The tincture is ready. Now, drink.32370Glory to the Alliance, . We are making gains against the Horde in the Krasarang Wilds, albeit slowly.While we hold the front here, we need your help to fight a different battle - one that strikes at our enemy's heart.Our SI:7 informant, Agent Connelly, has sent word that a Horde vanguard is moving up into the northern reaches of Kun-Lai Summit.Go without delay. Make contact with Agent Connelly in the field, and find out what is going on.Speak to Fennie over there for a flight in.32371Now comes the real challenge, . Head on over to the center of camp and see what you can overhear.32372The Kor'kron have been trained to be the finest, most loyal soldiers of the Warchief. Their presence here means that Garrosh fears an uprising.Vol'jin and his people are as much a part of the Horde as any orc.We must break this occupation and free the trolls. It pains me to say this, but you must eliminate enough of the Kor'kron so that the trolls can retake their city. Then meet me at Darkspear Hold so we might challenge their officer directly.32373We've progressed to a new part of the Pandaren campaign. The Alliance has landed on the shores with the full might of its navy. Your King aims to check Horde aggression in this new land.Garrosh Hellscream is propelling the Horde headfirst into battle, but King Varian Wrynn is a little more of a mystery to me. Do you have a moment? I'd like to talk to you about this leader of yours.32374My goal is an expedient end to this costly war. Prove to me that the Alliance deserves to win. Show me your prowess on the battlefield.You are not fighting some abstract force like the sha: You are facing your enemy head-on, eye-to-eye.Will you triumph?32375100 Buttonbelly Mushrooms.

I'd not delay if I were you.Speak to Tak-Tak for transportation.32377Garrosh is hell-bent on finding that Divine Bell. I wouldn't be surprised if he tore Kun-Lai Summit apart to find that artifact.The Warchief's called a gathering at Garrosh'ar Advance, just to our north.I need to stay here to monitor troop movements, so you'll have to infiltrate their camp and overhear their discussion.Go to Garrosh'ar Advance and steal some Kor'kron Armor from Reavers, Honor Guards, and Scouts.Take this radio earpiece. Don't contact me... I'll contact you.32378First thing's first. If we're going to take the leader captive, we'll need to thin the numbers of his agents.Be careful. These mogu are particularly dangerous - they appear to be manipulating the sha in ways we haven't seen before.32379I'm not prepared to throw away more of our people fighting against an enemy we don't know or understand. See if you can find any clues in the area as to who exactly these \"Korune\" mogu are. A contingency in case this operation doesn't go as planned.32380We're going to need help if we hope to figure out Garrosh's plans for Pandaria.I have someone specific in mind, but he will not be easy to convince.Agent Connelly considers himself retired, but one does not simply leave the SI: 7. We've had an undercover agent following his every move for months.Currently, he is disguising himself as a high roller at Bizmo's Brawlpub. Something about settling an old debt.Meet with our undercover agent in the Brawler's Guild.32381Now, I could tell you who Connelly is, but that would be too easy! To catch a spy you have to think like a spy.You have to pass the test first!The small things can say a lot about a person. It's all in the details.I'm going to give you a drink to deliver. I will give you a small detail about something the recipient is wearing. From there it will be up to you.Be careful who you pick to give drinks to. People here tend to get pretty hostile if you give them the wrong order!32382Agent Connelly has managed to infiltrate Garrosh's camp in Kun-Lai! He's been following their every move.Connelly requested you specifically to assist him in gathering some vital intelligence.He sent along a disguise for you. Make sure you put it on before approaching the camp! It will no doubt be heavily guarded.He insists you will know him when you see him. Something about your keen eye for details...Go talk to Fennie over there for a drop-off.32383I've managed to plant a few bugs around the camp, but there could always be more.I disguised the bugs to look like statues. They blend in perfectly with the other artifacts lying around.Your disguise should allow you to move freely around the camp. Just don't go near the dog and don't linger around Garrosh! Nero and Garrosh will see through your disguise.If you get caught I can't help you. I can't compromise the mission!32384It is time to make our move. Go to the Tomb of Shadows, weaken him, and take him captive.I will stay here in case Garrosh arrives. He must be delayed so that we can take our prize before he destroys it in his anger.Hurry!32388There's an orc general I've been keeping a close eye on. Warlord Bloodhilt curried a lot of favor with Garrosh Hellscream by beating back an Alliance advance in Southern Barrens. He's now entrenched within the fortress at Domination Point.I doubt the Alliance can take him out. But... you've proven me wrong before.If you wish to finish him off, bring friends. Lots of friends.32389This is a global war, . It has spilled onto Pandaria, and it has set hot spots across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms ablaze. How will you fare on an organized battlefront? I would like to see for myself.I look forward to hearing your report from the front lines.32390, through your eyes I've been able to witness the fighting along the coast, and the epic course of battles around the world. You've been very patient... and most informative.I've also been keeping a close eye on your King. Would you be interested to hear what I've learned?32391Garrosh sent a hundred riders to search the northern coast of Kun-Lai Summit, to seek a mogu crypt matching the one you saw in Shan Kien's memory.Out of those, one found the resting place of the Divine Bell.Blademaster Ishi is leading an advance party to secure the bell now.Go and assist him. Defend that artifact from anyone who might stand in your way!Speak to Tak-Tak without delay. He can take you there.32392If the Alliance thought they could steal the Divine Bell from us, they were wrong!Even now, we have them trapped in the crypts beneath us.Death will be the price they pay for defying us.Come, . Let us show them the error of their ways.32393It's time for our boldest move yet, .Since you acquired intel on the location of the Divine Bell, we've amassed a top team to excavate the artifact without delay.Commander Sarannha Skyglaive leads the expedition into the northern-most reaches of Kun-Lai Summit.Join them at once, and use whatever skills you need to make the endeavor a success.Good luck, . I don't need to tell you how important this mission is to the Alliance.Speak to Fennie. She'll get you there quickly.32394There's no telling what lies below, so I will lead the initial scouting party myself.If your report was correct, then the Korune mogu hid the Divine Bell in the rooms below our very feet.I have a feeling they would not have left such a precious artifact unguarded.I could use a capable  such as yourself to watch my back. Let me know when you're ready.3239532397I've noticed Garrosh and that Reliquary blood elf carrying around some sort of journal.The journal is never more than a stone's throw away. It must be important!If you can cause enough of a distraction, you may be able to swipe the journal off the table.These yaks might just do the trick. Give one of 'em a tap and they'll do the rest.Just be ready to move fast!32398Your efforts have culminated in this moment, .Warchief Garrosh gathers the most elite champions of the Horde in Kun-Lai Summit to witness the ringing of the Divine Bell.You have more than earned the right to participate.Go now. The dawn of the new Horde begins today.Speak to Tak-Tak. He should be able to secure your travel arrangements.32399It is time, . We have traveled a long path to reach this moment.Today, our Warchief, Garrosh Hellscream, will change the course of our people's history forever.Today, we witness the birth of Garrosh's Horde!Do not let anything interfere with the ceremony!32400Horde forces are amassing in huge numbers at the Emperor's Reach, high up in the mountains of Kun-Lai Summit.The area is an ancient mogu palace, and certainly a source of untold power.This can only mean one thing. Garrosh is going to use the Divine Bell, and Anduin... and the Harmonic Mallet... are both missing.I have no doubt that the fool boy went north by himself.I don't have time to gather an elite force to detain him. You must go and stop Anduin.Fennie can take you.32401Garrosh is right over there, and he's going to ring that bell at any moment.We don't have time to wait for my father's army. This is our only chance to stop him!I'll attempt to appeal to his senses before resorting to using the Harmonic Mallet.Charge in whenever you're ready, . I'll be right behind you.32402The night elves learned that the Divine Bell was stolen. This much we anticipated.However, they've also found out that the \"neutral\" Sunreavers of Dalaran were complicit. Now, we've got a situation.I need you to go to Dalaran. Speak with Kromthar for a ride. You are to rendezvous with Grand Magister Rommath once you arrive.32403Compared to the rest of the city, this part of the sewers is relatively calm. This is good - we can extract more Sunreavers in peace than we can in war.Find as many citizens as you can. Tell them that it is not safe here, that they must leave the city at once.And try to stay clear of the Silver Covenant. We don't want to cause a scene if we can avoid it. Not yet, anyhow.32404As I suspected, it gets worse up ahead. The Silver Covenant is outright attacking innocent Sunreavers!This cannot stand. While our prime directive is to rescue Aethas Sunreaver, we must also protect as many blood elves as we can.I will continue to scout ahead. Fight well, !32405Every Sunreaver Jaina expels from this city is a new blade that fights for the Horde. For US.I'm off to gather more strong elves. You've proven your hand in combat thus far - go take care of that creep in the black market.When you're done, we'll meet at the ramp and prepare to go aboveground.32406If we're to survive up above ground, we're going to need a base of operations.I'm going to try to take the center of the city. It's risky, but hopefully Jaina and the Silver Covenant won't expect it.Stay by my side now, .32408I have it on good authority that Archmage Aethas Sunreaver is being held in the Silver Enclave, home of the Silver Covenant. Arcanist Rathaella holds him in captivity.Most Covenant agents are out slaughtering Sunreavers right now, which means our chance is ripe. Slay Rathaella, and spring Aethas from his prison.32409Any pretense that the Kirin Tor might have had at being a \"neutral\" group can officially be discarded. I'm now hearing that Jaina's got Alliance troops stowed away near Antonidas Memorial.The area's free of Sunreavers, but it still makes my blood boil to see such blatant favoritism from the Kirin Tor.Go visit the memorial, ... and give those Alliance dogs a good kick on your way through.32410We can rescue as many Sunreavers as we want, but if they can't escape, then there's no point.The Silver Covenant will certainly be subduing and killing the Sunreavers' dragonhawks. Put a stop to it.32411There's still a number of significant Sunreavers who haven't been accounted for. Odds are that they're in the Sunreaver's Sanctuary, caught by surprise.The place is crawling with Silver Covenant. You'll need to get in, use the Tear to evacuate the VIPs, and then get out.Stay alive, .32412We've looked everywhere he's likely to be, except for one place: the Violet Citadel.Find out if Archmage Aethas is being held within the citadel, . We may get lucky. If not... at least we saved a number of lives today.32413Wherever your loyalties might lie - with Rommath and I, with Garrosh, or elsewhere - one thing is true: your acts today were truly heroic.I can arrange for your transport back to Krasarang Wilds. Speak with me if you would like passage back to Pandaria, .32414As you know, our night elven allies moved the Divine Bell you retrieved to Darnassus for safekeeping and study. Moments ago, they portaled some Highbourne mages over here to ask for backup. Details are hazy - some sort of stealth attack on the city?I don't know what to make of it, but Jaina Proudmoore is already on the scene and I suspect they need all the help they can get.Speak to Seamus Goldenkicks over there for a quick portal to Darnassus. Find Jaina!32416For too long, I have toiled to mend fences between Alliance and Horde. Time and time again, I've given the Horde the benefit of the doubt - and time and time again, they stab me in the back.I refuse to be betrayed again! If the Horde intends to use the Kirin Tor as a weapon against the Alliance, then they have no place in Dalaran.Come with me, .32417Jaina's doing a good job taking care of Sunreavers above ground, but there's still plenty rooting around in the sewers.Go find those lying rats and exterminate them!32418Most shopkeepers in the Magus Commerce Exchange have sided with the Silver Covenant, but there remain a few holdouts that must be taken care of.They will not go easily.32419The Sunreaver's Sanctuary is still crawling with those Horde-loving Sunreavers.Jaina will have sent the reasonable ones to the Violet Hold. The rest refuse to leave, raising their weapons against us.Show them the cost of their defiance. They now face the judgment of the Alliance, the Silver Covenant, and the Kirin Tor!32420I just saw one of the Sunreavers - Brasael, I think his name was - running off in the direction of the bank to the north. No doubt he's trying to gather whatever assets he can before he leaves.Head him off and make sure he doesn't steal any resources from our coffers. He relinquished whatever funds he left in the bank when he and his Sunreaver kind betrayed us.32421Compliant Sunreavers will be sent to the Violet Hold. Defiant ones are put to the sword.NONE are to escape.The Sunreavers keep their dragonhawk mounts on Krasus' Landing. Take this dust, and use it to render them incapable of flying.Or kill them. I don't care.32423Thank you for your aid today, . I will be handling the purge from here on out.Jaina will soon be off to Lion's Landing, to speak with King Varian.

It doesn't matter which one. Just kill those who are trying to bind the creature. This should let the fully armored beast run mad through the Zandalari camp. Then sit back and watch the hilarity ensue.32554The Zandalari use a series of fetishes and charms to maintain their control over their menagerie of beasts.Two can play at that game.I want you to find some of these fetishes and try them out on the various beasts in the Beast Pens.Take careful note of how each beast responds to each fetish.

Be ready for a fight!32594Our next objective is to temper this weapon with the blood of a demigod, one imbued with the Thunder King's powers.My agents tell me that the mogu named Shan Bu is creating just such a creature, intended to guard the Thunder King's citadel.Once your faction has fought your way to the front gates, attack Storm Lord Nalak and thrust this lance into his side. The creature will do everything in his power to stop you - stay alive long enough to siphon out the power of the Storm Lord!32595Do you recall Mason's Folly, the hilltop east of here where you and I met before?I'm going to use the Lightning Lance to create something special, and I certainly can't do it in here.Meet me atop Mason's Folly so that we may celebrate our victories together!32596I'm beginning to see the bigger picture, now, and how the mogu relate to the Titans.

Destroy the Thunder King and his minions and collect as many Titan runestones as you can find!32597The Thunder King. Dead for twelve thousand years, only to be brought back by Zandalari voice.

Bring me his cold, dead heart!32598The Thunder King is dead, and his instruments of oppression are being picked over by the Alliance and Horde for their own ends.We come now to the climax of the pandaren campaign. Hellscream's machinations have brought the Alliance down on his head - but even more importantly, he's fractured the unity of the Horde. As the Pandaren say: \"The Wok is Hot.\" Something is about to give, and all of our work comes down to this.I need time to plan. See me as soon as your faction is ready to make its move!32599It is rumored that the Thunder King's power comes directly from a hidden source within his palace.Even when he is defeated a new tyrant, Garrosh perhaps, could still use this magic to a terrible end.That is unless we make the first move!Take my staff into the Pinnacle of Storms.

I can see you're ready to continue exploring the mysteries of Lin's secret ingredient soup.From what I can tell, Lin used Stormstout brew for his soup broth.I think the next steps for you are to create a Noodle Cart of your own and to head to the Stormstout Brewery to collect some sloshes of brew.3302533026I'm so excited, . We've nearly mastered all the ingredients for noodle soup!We have plenty of vegetables and spices here, but the Lin family had access to exotic meats not seen in Pandaria for some time. We need some nice, fatty meats.Grandpa used to tell me of ancient turtles living off the shores of the Timeless Isle. Something that lives that long has to have some nice fatty meat on its bones.Create a deluxe noodle cart and gather some fatty turtle steaks and we'll continue.33027The best way to go about doing this is through hands-on experience.I've arranged for merchants, scholars, and farmers from all over Pandaria to come for a taste test of your soups. We'll get the best results if you can match them to the soups they prefer.It's time to find the secret ingredient!3304733087I'm certain you're eager to test out your new cloak.

They are testing the mettle of all of Pandaria's heroes.This challenge is not impossible, but you'll need to follow the advice of the last Pandaren Emperor and tackle it with unwavering inner strength. You'll also need a small army, so find a group of people you trust.Defeat the four celestials here in the Celestial Court, and our journey is almost complete...33104I have learned so much in this timeless place, friend.

This Mistweaver Ai, she carries a time-worn journal, if I recall? This may be the answer to many of our questions, or it may simply raise more. I suppose that it all depends on the diligence of the explorer that put pen to paper in this preposterous place.Obtain a time-worn journal and return to me with it. We shall delve into its mysteries together.33333The journal indicates that treasures abound across the island, sometimes temptingly out of reach, and other times hidden in dark caves and hollows. What might have been secreted away here, many generations ago?And perhaps more importantly, by whom?Search the island for such treasures, and return to me with your findings. Be warned that all that glitters is not gold, yet the reverse is also true. Sometimes the simple hollowed-out stump is the best hiding place for one's valuables.33334An island lost in time and yet it returns flourishing with life!Where did this island travel to? Did it simply hop forward in time, or did it languish in the dark reaches of the Twisting Nether?There is one thing for certain: the creatures that inhabit this place are far more than they seem. I sense a hidden power in them, forged by the eons. Seek out the champions of their species, duly marked by their power and prowess, and vanquish five such creatures.In death, we may find the clues we seek.33335From what I have gathered, this place used to be a tournament ground of sorts, where warriors from throughout Pandaria would show their prowess by following in the footsteps of their last emperor, Shaohao.I have heard that when Shaohao completed his trials, he became one with the land, and enveloped Pandaria in a thick mist, obscuring it from even our abilities to penetrate the passages of time.That sounds quite interesting, perhaps you should speak with him?33336It is about time that I revealed to you my purpose on this island.The bronze dragonflight's powers have diminished greatly - we can now only catch furtive glimpses through time. It is... quite frustrating.But we are not entirely without means. I hold in my hand the Vision of Time, an artifact of my own creation. The creatures of this isle have passed through time, and may carry with them some of its essence. With it, we will fill the hourglass, granting us a window into the timeways once more.33337Look at how the Vision reacts! Astounding! Even now it shows shadows of timeways that flit around us constantly. Though not true sands of the Hourglass of Time, the finely-ground epoch stones certainly have a power all their own. Our first task is to use them to calibrate the Vision of Time.Take the Vision of Time to a location where history is in the making: the Siege of Orgrimmar. Once there, turn the hourglass and see what happens.33338The hourglass gives us glimpses into the streams of time we once walked as easily as a well-worn path.Gather additional epoch stones, so that we may continue to use the power of the hourglass to delve into the mysteries of the timeways.The future depends on it.33340As you have surmised, the flora and fauna of this island are quite unusual. Not all explanations are mysterious, however. Sometimes, we must listen to the land, to hear the tales of the world around us. Have you considered that the creatures of this island grew to such proportions simply from the nutriment of the land you walk upon?You will find nutriment in abundance throughout the island: ripe fruits, eggs, meat, flowers, nuts, and even the stones themselves. Eat, and discover the power of the land.33341Many years ago, these grounds were a place where my people would come in pilgrimage. Here, they would listen to the words of the Celestials, and meditate for many days. In their meditations, they found the fear, anger, despair, doubt, and violence that plagued their spirits.Before them would be a pathway to enlightenment. For each, the pathway would be different. For all of them, the pathway began with wisdom.Travel the island, as they did, and discover one of the lost wayshrines of the Celestials.33342The pandaren once existed in harmony with the Ordon yaungol. When the island suddenly disappeared, the Ordon faced certain death. In their desperation, the chief shaman called out for aid to the Fire Lords, and was answered.Ordos was his name. Now, he is a creature of anger and violence. Though his people were saved, he burns endlessly in molten agony.There is harmony no longer. The Ordon seek to take the Celestial Court, and sacrifice us all to Ordos. Drive them back, and restore balance.33343Your efforts have driven back the Ordon and brought peace to the Celestial Court, but it will not last. It is time to silence the great emissary of Ordos - the Archiereus of Flame.Speak with Mistweaver Ku and purchase a Scroll of Challenge, then travel to Three-Breeze Terrace to the north. Issue a challenge at the challenge stone, it will undoubtedly catch the attention of the Ordon, drawing the Archiereus out of the Ordon Sanctuary. It is your only chance.3334533346333473334833354This is the pelt of Darkmoon Island's monstrous den mother.Yebb Neblegear, beastmaster of the Darkmoon Faire, will be happy to know the ghostly wolf and her spawn will no longer be terrorizing his menagerie... at least for a little while.

As you listen to the wind rustling in the trees, and note even the smallest butterfly, your mind is open to learning the deepest lessons the trials have to teach us. Perhaps you noticed the many great beasts that roam the island?Therein lies your trial. You have learned much from Pandaria, now let us put your knowledge to the test.33375I have finished grinding the stones, and have attuned the hourglass to a new series of timeways. Will you return to the Siege of Orgrimmar and turn the hourglass once more?Return quickly, I am most curious.33376I have not been completely forthright with you, despite all that you have done to aid the Timewalkers. I cannot tell you everything, not yet, but know this - there is a traitor amongst us. Tell no one of your mission today, and take caution around any of my flight while you hold the Vision of Time.Quickly now, return to the Siege of Orgrimmar once more and use the hourglass.And be safe.33377You have kept our mission a secret, and for that I thank you. Knowledge of the timeways, when in the wrong hands, can cause catastrophic devastation. My flight has little power to repair it, now. We must be careful.The hourglass grows in power. I believe it can now be used to see much further than before. I wish you to push it to its limits.Return to the Siege of Orgrimmar, and focus the hourglass on the most devastating timeway you can find.33378The Vision of Time is nearly perfected, we now have much more control over the visions we seek. Your efforts have been instrumental in completing the artifact and restoring the strength of not only my flight, but also our allies in the Timewalkers. All of us are in your debt.Quite fortunately, I have located a sort of crux in time - an intersection of timeways - right here in Pandaria. Take the Vision of Time to the Temple of the White Tiger. There, in the cellars, turn the hourglass.33379I do not wish to ask this of you again, but I do not know who I can trust any longer. I have been using the Vision of Time to gather information, and in my searches, I believe I have found another crux in time. It is in the Caverns of Time itself.I did not want to believe it when the vision first came to me, but I cannot sit idly by and let this information pass. The Caverns of Time - you must go there, now, and use the Vision of Time.Move quickly!33385336023360333634"
