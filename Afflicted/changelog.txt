    * Fixed the spellID showing when a custom spell is added by spellID
    * Fixed /afflicted test not checking the redirected anchor to see if it's enabled or disabled
    * Removed a dontFade check on UnitDied for icon display, the only thing that will remain is cooldowns when someone dies
    * Updated a bunch of libraries

    * Fixed a bug with dispel alerts showing even with the option disabled
    * Removed trigger limit options, doesn't seem to be needed anymore due to a change in how we actually start timers, will remove completely in an update or two if nobody notices
    * Added the SM widget for status bars so you get a preview of what it looks like

    * Cleaned up timer triggering, we now do test timers directly in config.lua so we don't need special checks to see if we're trying to process a test timer
    * Removed the debuffID trigger limit check, as we don't use it anymore
    * Removed timerExists API since we don't need it anymore
    * Removed the commented out linked code, won't need it
    * Updated AceConfig-3.0 and AceGUI-3.0

    * Fixed a concat nil error at around line #320 in Afflicted.lua
    * Fixed the barID for cooldowns, it's now id,CD instead of id:CD
    * Fixed some small visual issues with the UI
    * Fixed dropdowns with no value inside for anchors and spells
    * Fixed spell categorization errors, Evasion, Icy Veins, Berserker Rage and Perception will show up in the buffs anchor instead of spells now
    * Removed Counterspell - Silenced from the spell list, this should no longer be needed due to the timer triggering changes in Afflicted2
    * Removed the ability to link spells, as far as I can tell this is no longer needed I'll re-add it back if this turns out to be wrong
    * Changed the way cooldowns show up visually, if their shown in their own anchor it won't display [CD] next to them, but if you redirect them to another anchor it will append [CD] like normal

    * We now track buffs and debuffs of enemies again, since Cheat Death doesn't have a SPELL_CAST_START trigger
    * When we summon a new object of the same spellID, we kill the old one this means Shamans resummoning totems will have the old one die off
    * Fixed a typo that was causing a concat error at line #318 when a spell was removed early
    * Updated GTB to hopefully fix some 59:59 timer issues

    * Trying out a new profile feature, you can set specific profiles to use in different arenas, meaning you can set different spells to be used, you cannot however switch between bar and icon style depending on arena.
    * Will only process debuffs now, since those are all we care about instead of buffs as well
    * Removed the name trigger limit, because we catch timers based on success will always only trigger one so no Shadowstep types of issues
    * Changed the messages to be more generic, we only use one trigger/fade message now, if you want specific messages based on buff type do it by anchor then
    * Updated GTB to fix callback issues
    * Added Blade Flurry, Adrenaline Rush, Devour Magic to spell list, all disabled by default

    * Added repeating timers option, for things like tracking totem pulses
    * Added redirection for anchors, you can change the timer displays to another GTB based timer group

    * THIS IS A 2.4 ONLY VERSION FROM NOW ON, IF YOU USE IT ON 2.3 LIVE IT'LL BREAK
    * Recoded adding and removing spells, should be a bit cleaner now
    * You can now link spells, for example you can link Counterspell - Silence to Counterspell, meaning if a Counterspell timer is going on and Counterspell - Silence is triggered it'll skip the second timer.
    * Spell types are now removed, however you can flag a spell to be checked as a debuff as well
    * Added Flame/Frost Shock because they are the same cooldowns as Earth Shock
    * You can now spawn your own anchors, type /afflicted ui to add new ones, or to change which anchor a spell goes to
    * Added Parrot support
    * Added icon support with texture embedding, includes an option to disable which I forgot to implement
    * Fixed positioning of anchors, will correctly work if scale changes now

    * Added a don't fade option to spells, mostly for things like Bloodlust or Shadowstep where you want to see the duration of the buff left. But you don't want the entire timer removed as soon as one person loses it.

    * Updated OptionHouse
    * Added in the trigger limit feature, lets you set a spell to only be allowed to trigger after X seconds have passed, mainly needed for things like Psychic Scream or Howl of Terror where we can't get the "XX casts" or "XX hits you" messages but the "XX is afflicted by" message triggers for each person whos hit
